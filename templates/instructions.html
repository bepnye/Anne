			<h2>Task</h2>
			<p>This task is about identifying and grouping mentions of medical concepts in abstracts from Randomized Controlled Trials.</p>
			<p><span class="hl i">Interventions</span> or <span class="hl i">comparators</span> (collectively called <span class="hl i">treatments</span>) associated with different arms of the trial, or the measured <span class="hl o">outcomes</span> are often mentioned several times throughout the abstract. The goal of this task is to highlight all occurences of one of the trial's <span class="hl i">treatments</span> and <span class="hl o">outcomes</span>, and group together repeated mentions of the same concept.</p>
			<p>The annotation process has three components to it:
				<ul>
					<li>Highlight <b>every</b> occurence of a studied treatment or outcome.</li>
					<li>For every different treatment or outcome you find in the article, assign its mentions to a different group.</li>
					<li>Go through the previously extracted annotations for the article and assign them to the relevant groups.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section container-fluid" id="details">
				<h2>Details: Highlighting</h2>
				<p>As you read through the article, highlight every snippet of text you find that represents one of the studied <span class="hl i">treatments</span> or <span class="hl o">outcomes</span>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We are only interested in the treatments and outcomes that are actively evaluated in this particular trial.</li>
					<li>Keep the highlighted text as short as possible while including any details that are specific to that snippet.</li>
			        <li>Try to include details that differentiate the snippet from other similar but clinically different snippets in the document (such as any <b>dosages</b> that go with the treatments, and any <b>endpoints</b> that go with the outcomes).</li>
					<li>If multiple distinct concepts are listed in a row (such as a list of outcomes), highlight them individually.</li>
					<li>For <b>complex interventions</b> that involve multiple treatments, include as much of the full intervention strategy as you can in the highlighted snippet.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Details: Grouping</h2>
				<p>After highlighting each snippet, group it together with other snippets you've already highlighted that are <b>clinically equivalent in the context of this trial</b>. In other words, all of the snippets within a single group should be roughly interchangeable in this abstract. If you don't already have a group that fits the highlighted snippet, create a new group for it.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>When deciding how to group snippets, ignore any syntactic differences such as verb tense or pluralization.</li>
					<li>If a specific treatment or outcome is referred to by a more general term, include it in the same group as long is it is unambiguous in the context of the abstract. However if a general term is used to refer to multiple arms of a trial or to a group of measured outcomes, assign the general term to a new group.</li>
					<li>When creating a group, you can pick any name you like - the names are only to help faciliate the annotation process.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="section container-fluid" id="interface">
				<h2>Interface</h2>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>The interface for this task is designed for you to highlight as you read through the article, and immediately assign the highlights to groups that you create.</p>
				<div class="img">
			  		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rHSoWTZ.png" title="hl interface" />
				</div>
				<p>The annotation interface containes three main components:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Article Tabs</b>: each full-text article is broken up in to sections. For this task, only the <b>Abstract</b> tab will be available.</li>
					<li><b>Tab Content</b>: this displays the text content of the current section. This is where you will highlight the relevant text snippets.</li>
					<li><b>Created Groups</b>: creating a new group will add a tab here that you can use to navigate between them.</li>
					<li><b>Highlighted snippets</b>: each snippet you add to the selected group will be collected in this area for you to reference.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="example">Automatic Suggestions</h3>
				<p>Due to the repetitive nature of this task, we have implemented a feature to help reduce the amount of simple highlighting you need to do. When you highlight a snippet and add it to a group, the interface will <b>automatically pre-highlight</b> all other instances of that snippet throughout the article. These suggested snippets are <b>not added until you confirm them</b> by hovering over them using the popup menu to either confirm (‚úì) or discard (êÑÇ) each snippet.</p>
				<div class="img">
			  		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ptI0Rlx.png" title="suggestions" />
				</div>
				<p>Please be careful when using this feature, and discard and re-highlight any instances where the suggested span is not correct. For example if you highlight "<b><span class="hl o">heel pain</span></b>", you may then encounter a sentence that includes the suggested snippet "<b>plantar <span class="hl o" style="border: 1px dashed; border-color: #ffa200;">heel pain</span></b>". In this situation you would need to discard the suggestion so that you can highlight the complete outcome, "<b><span class="hl o">plantar heel pain</span></b>".</p>

				<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
				<p>Here is an example of what the interface looks like during the annotation process. You can see how the different <span class="hl o">outcomes</span> have been divided in to different groups.</p>
				<div class="img">
			  		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/V1f5pgX.png" title="example" />
				</div>
		        <ol>
		          <li>The first mention of <span class="hl o">'first-step' pain</span> includes extra detail about how the outcome is specified.</li>
		          <li><span class="hl o">Foot pain</span> is similar to <span class="hl o">'first-step' pain</span>, but is not interchangeable in this trial and is assigned to a new group.</li>
		          <li>The second mention of <span class="hl o">'first-step' pain</span> includes a specific endpoint, but since only one <b>endpoint</b> is measured in this trial this mention is semantically equivalent to the first.</li>
		          <li>The first <span class="hl i">treatment</span> mentioned is a <b>complex intervention</b>, so we highlight the entire snippet as a single mention.</li>
		          <li>Subsequent references to the <span class="hl i">low-Dye taping and sham ultrasound</span> intervention don't explicitly include the complete intervention, but in the context of this article they refer to the same intervention and are assigned to the same group.</li>
		        </ol>

			</div>

			<div class="section container-fluid" id="anns">
				<h2>Existing Annotations</h2>
				<p>Previous annotators have provided details about the article's <span class="hl i">interventions</span>, <span class="hl i">comparators</span>, and <span class="hl o">outcomes</span>. The last tab of the article contains these annotations.</p>
				<div class="img">
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/A5yl3Fz.png" title="source: imgur.com" />
				</div>
				<p>Assign each of these snippets to the relevant group by clicking on it and then adding it. Once you have assigned all of the provided annotations, you may submit the article.</p>
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="section container-fluid" id="controls">
		  		<p>Use the following keybindings to facilitate annotation:</p>
		  		<ul>
		  			<li><b>s</b>: add highlighted/selected snippet to current group</li>
		  			<li><b>e/&lt;del&gt;</b>: remove selected snippet</li>
		  			<li><b>g</b>: create new group</li>
		  			<li><b>d</b>: delete current group</li>
		  			<li><b>t</b>: show Treatment groups</li>
		  			<li><b>o</b>: show Outcome groups</li>
		  			<li><b>[1-9]</b>: show the numbered group</li>
		  		</ul>
          <p><b>Double-click</b> on a group to rename it, or <b>shift + double-click</b> a group to create a new group starting from the same name.<p>
