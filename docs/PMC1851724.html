However, in order to reliably find out whether NSAIDs reduce the risk of Alzheimer's, it is important to perform a properly designed randomized trial. Such a trial, ADAPT, was sponsored by the United States National Institute on Aging, and the study started recruitment in 2001. The trial involved three treatment arms: naproxen (one type of NSAID), celecoxib (another type of NSAID, but one that specifically inhibits an enzyme called COX-2), and placebo, acting as a control. It was planned that 2,625 participants would be recruited and that the primary outcome of interest was incidence of Alzheimer's disease in the three treatment arms; the trial would run for 7 y. However, this trial was terminated early, a decision based in part on information from other studies that demonstrated an increased risk of certain harms, such as heart attacks and strokes, in people taking celecoxib and other types of COX-2 inhibitors. Therefore meaningful data were not available at the time on the study's primary outcome (prevention of Alzheimer's disease). However, data about the chance of these harms are available from the ADAPT results, and these results are presented here.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7126" xml_f="7127" txt_i="3615" txt_f="3616">

For each individual type of event, some were more likely in people treated with celecoxib compared with placebo, but others were not. When considering people taking naproxen, all four types of adverse events were more likely to occur in the treatment group as compared to placebo. The investigators then combined data from all four types of harm together, and here they found that the overall risk in people taking celecoxib was higher than for people taking placebo, but that this was not statistically significant, so it could have been due to chance alone. When considering naproxen as compared with placebo, the researchers saw an approximately 60% increase in risk for all four harms combined, and this result was statistically significant. The death rate in people taking either celecoxib or naproxen was higher than for those taking placebo, but this was not statistically significant, and therefore could have been due to chance.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8286" xml_f="8287" txt_i="4756" txt_f="4757">

One limitation is that although the trial was large and appropriately powered for the main outcome (prevention of Alzheimer's disease), the number of safety events reported here were small and the trial was not primarily designed to examine safety. Further, participants eligible to join this trial were required to have a family history of Alzheimer's disease, so it is possible that their risk factors are slightly different from the general population.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9105" xml_f="9106" txt_i="5556" txt_f="5557">

Very few published data exist on the long-term safety of celecoxib as compared with placebo, although there are a number of as-yet-unpublished studies. These data on harms provided by ADAPT provide important results that should be incorporated into future meta-analyses. Such meta-analyses will give a more rigorous and reliable assessment of the safety of the drugs studied here.</offsets></p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"></page-count></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>ADAPT Research Group (2006) Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in the randomized, controlled Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT).

Suspension of naproxen reflected the ADAPT investigators' reluctance to imply, by continuing the trial, that naproxen was safer than celecoxib when ADAPT data did not support this conclusion.

First, because ADAPT was not designed to detect differences in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks, the composite outcomes were specified post hoc. We designed their constituent events both to be as comparable as possible to the approaches used in the Antiplatelet Trialists Collaboration and the APC trials and to draw on outcomes collected in a systematic manner from close-ended questions asked to participants at every follow-up contact. Because ADAPT by design focused on neurological events, we asked participants specifically about the occurrence of both stroke and TIA. Although we also asked about MI and CHF, we did not ask specific questions about conditions such as unstable angina or other indications for interventional cardiologic procedures and therefore were not able to include them in our composite of systematically collected outcomes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37824" xml_f="38476" txt_i="28564" txt_f="29216">We also did not have a priori procedures for adjudication of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. Although we could employ such procedures post hoc in an attempt to increase the precision of reported events, these procedures have several limitations. We cannot identify missed events, and we cannot be certain that the process of adjudication is not influenced by the current controversy. Therefore, adjudication will only decrease the absolute risk observed and could bias the relative risk. Also, adjudication may foster a sense of precision that is inappropriate given the small numbers of reported events in a trial that was terminated early [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010033-b032" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="38522" xml_f="38524" txt_i="29216" txt_f="29218">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38531" xml_f="38701" txt_i="29218" txt_f="29388">].

A corresponding caution in their interpretation is warranted. Even so, our actions, as well as those of other investigators and the FDA, reflect the low tolerance for risk in primary prevention trials. For their participants, the only benefit of the intervention is the possibility of later protection from a condition they might have avoided in any case. This creates some difficulty for extrapolation to the clinical setting, where these drugs are used for pain relief in conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and the potential risks need to be weighed against the known immediate benefits of treatment. Nevertheless, we as a medical and research community are attempting just such difficult extrapolation, as the primary prevention setting is providing long-term, placebo-controlled data for drugs approved on the basis of short-term trials but used for the treatment of chronic conditions frequently necessitating decades of analgesic therapy. Therefore, we believe it is essential to make data from long-term trials such as ADAPT available to contribute to the larger body of evidence on drug safety.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title><offsets xml_i="39987" xml_f="40009" txt_i="30635" txt_f="30657">SUPPORTING INFORMATION</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010033-sd001"><label><offsets xml_i="40098" xml_f="40115" txt_i="30658" txt_f="30675">CONSORT Checklist</offsets></label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010033.sd001.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="40178" xml_f="40214" txt_i="30675" txt_f="30711">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media><p><offsets xml_i="40239" xml_f="40250" txt_i="30712" txt_f="30723">(47 KB DOC)</offsets></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010033-sd002"><label><offsets xml_i="40360" xml_f="40403" txt_i="30724" txt_f="30767">Trial Protocol: ADAPT Protocol, Version 1.4</offsets></label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010033.sd002.pdf"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="40466" xml_f="40502" txt_i="30767" txt_f="30803">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media><p><offsets xml_i="40527" xml_f="40539" txt_i="30804" txt_f="30816">(233 KB PDF)</offsets></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6"><title><offsets xml_i="40594" xml_f="40613" txt_i="30818" txt_f="30837">COMPETING INTERESTS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40624" xml_f="41393" txt_i="30838" txt_f="31607">The writing committee that takes primary responsibility for this paper (see Acknowledgments) reports the following competing interests.
