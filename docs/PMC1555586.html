Eligibility criteria are adults able to undertake the programme with type 2 diabetes, not taking insulin, with HbA1c over 8% (first 12 months) and following an agreed protocol change over 7% (months 13 to 18). Following randomisation, intervention nurses receive two-day training and delivered the Diabetes Manual programme to participants. Deferred intervention nurses receive the training following six-month follow-up. Primary outcome is HbA1c with total and HDL cholesterol; blood pressure, body mass index; self-efficacy and quality of life as additional outcomes. Primary analysis is between-group HbA1c differences at 6 months powered to give 80% power to detect a difference in HbA1c of 0.6%. A 12 month cohort analysis will assess maintenance of effect and assess relationship between self-efficacy and outcomes, and a qualitative study is running alongside.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5184" xml_f="5194" txt_i="1523" txt_f="1533">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5205" xml_f="5619" txt_i="1534" txt_f="1948">This trial incorporates educational and psychological diabetes interventions into a single programme and assesses both clinical and psychosocial outcomes.

Using an intra cluster correlation for HbA1c of 0.043 and allowing for 15% patient attrition and variability in clusters size gives an adjusted sample size of 212 in each arm. Allowing for an attrition rate of 10% for practices, we aimed to recruit a total of 46 practices, each willing to recruit up to12 patients. Because of the lower rate of patient recruitment in the first twelve months, we expected fewer patients per practice. We compensated for this by recruiting more practices. We estimated that with analysable data on five patients per practice in 50 practices the power of our study to detect a 0.6% difference would be 80% (accounting for between cluster correlation and variable cluster size as described above).
