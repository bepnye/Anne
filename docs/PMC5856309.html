Thus, advantages of EMDs are that they can provide more detailed information of patterns of use over a period of time compared with self-report. Limitations of EMDs are that it can be difficult to distinguish whether interventions improve pill-taking behaviour or simply improve use of the monitor, that opening the container doesn’t equate to ingestion, and the devices themselves could interfere with the intervention if the participant has to transfer pills into a container. Devices that mimic pill packets would be costly and require a closed pharmacy system.</offsets></p><p id="Par25"><offsets xml_i="17421" xml_f="18378" txt_i="10846" txt_f="11803">Measuring use of other contraceptive methods such as implant, IUD and injectable are somewhat easier compared to OC as it is not necessary to assess daily adherence; the women is either protected from pregnancy by the method, or not. These methods can be assessed as follows. First, by self-report (i.e. asking the participant if they are using a method) but this method is subject to biases already mentioned. In particular it might be difficult to recall the date the method was started e.g. date of injection. Second, objectively by reviewing clinic records, but in the case of implant and IUD, this does not indicate continued use if the participant had the device removed in a different clinic. Finally, current use of IUD or implant can be assessed by clinical examination; by palpating the sub-dermal implant or visualising the IUD threads but this entails an intimate examination. IUD or implant use could also be assessed by ultrasound examination.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title><offsets xml_i="18410" xml_f="18456" txt_i="11805" txt_f="11851">Assessing contraception use in the MOTIF trial</offsets></title><p id="Par26"><offsets xml_i="18478" xml_f="19589" txt_i="11852" txt_f="12963">For the MOTIF trial, we did not consider it feasible to measure objective contraception use for several reasons. We were concerned that participants wouldn’t be able to return to the clinic for objective follow-up due to lack of time as many lived in rural areas far from the clinic. Furthermore we were concerned about whether it was appropriate, potentially a betrayal of trust, to ask women to return to clinic for internal examination to check IUD threads simply to verify self-report information already provided. We were not able to rely on clinic records of contraception use as the trial was not operating within a closed pharmacy system; oral and injectable contraceptives can be obtained from pharmacists without prescriptions in Cambodia, and long-acting reversible methods (intrauterine device or implant) could be removed in other clinics. Therefore assessment of the primary outcome, use of effective contraception at four and 12 months post-abortion for the MOTIF trial was self-report by phone call.
