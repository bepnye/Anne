In the C group, a syringe filled with air was attached to the hub of the Tuohy needle and the needle was advanced until LOR was noted. In the ED group, an Epidrum® was attached between the hub of the Tuohy needle and the syringe filled with air. Thereafter, Epidrum® was inflated with 1.5 ml air, and the Touhy needle was advanced with both hands until the inflated silicone membrane became deflated. After deflation of the diaphragm, the Epidrum® and syringe were disconnected and a 27-gauge spinal needle was inserted through the epidural needle to inject bupivacaine into the intrathecal space. After the spinal needle was removed, an epidural catheter was inserted into the epidural space. All CSE was performed by one second year resident who had performed more than 300 cases.

Therefore, we enrolled 54 patients in each group to allow for possible protocol violations during the study period. To compare variables between the two groups, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to identify the variables with a normal distribution. The variables with a normal distribution were compared by independent t-tests and those without a normal distribution were compared by the Mann-Whitney U-test.

The etiology and mechanisms of failed epidural anesthesia are complex and multifactorial. Contributing factors in unsatisfactory epidural block can include technical skills and experience. The inflated diaphragm of Epidrum® acts as the meniscus of a manometer and allows the operator to interpret the position of the needle tip. This visual sign provides easy interpretation and monitoring by a supervisor during procedure. For an inexperienced operator, Epidrum® provides an easier approach to epidural anesthesia than the conventional method.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14343" xml_f="15354" txt_i="9480" txt_f="10491">This study, which compared Epidrum® to the conventional method for identifying the epidural space, showed the superiority of Epidrum®. In group C, 13 of 54 cases required more than 2 attempts to locate the epidural space and 5 of these 13 cases had more than 4 attempts. The multiple attempts in group C were caused by false positive signals related to the subjective detection of the change in resistance by the operator. The cause of the fewer attempts in the ED group compared to the C group is thought to result from visual signals (the silicon membrane diaphragm) replacing the subjective detection of resistance change by the operator's thumb. In the ED group, only 2 cases had more than 2 attempts, and at that time, the diaphragm of the Epidrum® was slowly deflated. Therefore we suggested that the epidural needle tip was not initially placed at the interspinous ligament, and an air leak of the diaphragm occurred into the patient's tissue, including muscles or tendons, but not in the epidural space.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15361" xml_f="15749" txt_i="10492" txt_f="10880">In the ED group, the operators and observers' ease and satisfaction scores were significantly higher than those in group C. The better ease scores for the operators might have been influenced by placing 2 hands on the needle and the visual endpoint signals.

Also, continuous pressure in the device and swift visual signal change provide prompt interpretation to an operator and a supervisor; however, false positive signals can occur. This problem could be resolved when the operator correctly places the epidural needle tip into the interspinous ligament, and it is important to know the qualitative differences between slow deflation of the diaphragm caused by air leak into low density tissue and the rapid deflation caused by entry of the needle tip into the epidural space.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16591" xml_f="16746" txt_i="11704" txt_f="11859">Another instrument called the Episure® Autodetect® syringe (Indigo, Orb, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) used for identifying the epidural space has been reported [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><offsets xml_i="16778" xml_f="16780" txt_i="11859" txt_f="11861">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16787" xml_f="16788" txt_i="11861" txt_f="11862">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="16820" xml_f="16822" txt_i="11862" txt_f="11864">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16829" xml_f="17252" txt_i="11864" txt_f="12287">].
