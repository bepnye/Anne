Especially in developing countries, there is the need to identify resources outside the well-established local vaccine delivery system (usually the EPI program). The Hechi campaign illustrates that an existing healthcare system can deliver vaccines to large populations in a fairly short period of time. Community members can play a key role in the success of promotional activities and delivery of vaccines when an entire city is targeted.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="31937" xml_f="32555" txt_i="20067" txt_f="20685">The Hechi campaign monitored and recorded safety systematically and in depth. No life-threatening serious AE were associated with either vaccine. No reported AE (solicited or not) were serious and all patients recovered quickly. Use of safety boxes was introduced for the first time in Hechi during this mass vaccination campaign. Despite instruction on safe handling of sharps, 3 needle-stick injuries were recorded. For future mass vaccination campaigns, including routine EPI activities, safe injection practices must be introduced and emphasized to prevent unnecessary accidents and spread of blood-borne diseases.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32562" xml_f="33313" txt_i="20686" txt_f="21437">A mop-up strategy increased the coverage by 9.6% on average in the lower-coverage clusters and by 0.7% increase in the higher-coverage clusters. Because mop-up strategies imply the need for additional time and costs, this strategy should be planned in advance. Adult coverage was slightly lower than that of children, but a 70% coverage indicates the ability to reach adults during a vaccination campaign. The comprehensive vaccine safety surveillance system, implemented within the existing Hechi health facilities, was useful. Post-licensure monitoring can address many issues regarding safety, such as: uncommon AE, incorrect storage or administration procedures and dissemination of information to the public to maintain confidence in the scheme [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="33345" xml_f="33347" txt_i="21437" txt_f="21439">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33354" xml_f="33356" txt_i="21439" txt_f="21441">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33363" xml_f="33842" txt_i="21442" txt_f="21921">The cost-effectiveness of the use of Vi vaccine will be analyzed at the end of the study. However, because the vaccine is locally produced, it seems reasonable to anticipate that unlike EPI vaccines, cost savings can be achieved by reduced transportation costs and in-country production of the vaccine. In an urban area of Vietnam, a locally produced oral cholera vaccine distributed through mass immunization was found to be affordable if introduced in a public health program [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><offsets xml_i="33874" xml_f="33876" txt_i="21921" txt_f="21923">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33883" xml_f="34073" txt_i="21923" txt_f="22113">].

Besides school-based immunization programs, all-age (5–60 years) Vi mass vaccinations are potentially an important public health strategy to prevent typhoid fever in high-risk populations in southern China. Follow-up of the randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials of Vi vaccine indicate that vaccine protection of 50% lasts for 3 years (manuscript in preparation).

We anticipate that the vaccine cost results, together with cost-effectiveness analysis of the Hechi program, will complement the above findings and provide objective information to assist policymakers
