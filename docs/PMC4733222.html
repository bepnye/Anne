Fittle provides a built-in, private social networking feature that allows users to work and engage with their team members so that they can support each other as they learn and adopt new, healthier habits (details about the application are described below). Fittle incorporates a number of evidence-based techniques that are motivated by the theory of planned behavior and social cognitive theory to positively impact health behavior change. Moreover, these interventions can be delivered at low cost because the scaffolding for individual success is either automated or provided through peer support.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18002" xml_f="18025" txt_i="10931" txt_f="10954">The study in Du et al [</offsets><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18059" xml_f="18061" txt_i="10954" txt_f="10956">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18068" xml_f="18903" txt_i="10956" txt_f="11791">] was not designed to systematically study the effects of having team support as all participants were assigned to teams. However, hierarchical regression analyses, including team as a mediating factor, and post-hoc analyses of the impact of team interactions on outcomes were both strongly suggestive of an association between teams, program adherence, and health outcomes. In this current feasibility study, we specifically aimed to compare the Fittle mobile phone-based health behavior change program administered in a solo versus group environment. We hypothesized that using a theory-guided, group/team-based behavior change mobile app (Mobile-Team condition) will result in higher adherence, more improved eating habits, reduced stress, and improved fitness level compared to Mobile-Solo, ePaper-Team, and ePaper-Solo conditions.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18925" xml_f="18931" txt_i="11793" txt_f="11799">Fittle</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18942" xml_f="19029" txt_i="11800" txt_f="11887">Fittle is implemented as a client-server architecture running on both iOS and Android. </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1"><offsets xml_i="19064" xml_f="19072" txt_i="11887" txt_f="11895">Figure 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19079" xml_f="19531" txt_i="11895" txt_f="12347"> shows several screens of Fittle.

Participants were asked questions in a short follow-up survey to help characterize their reporting behaviors in terms of various time frames relative to challenge activity completion (ie, same day, next day, within 1 week, more than 1 week, and end of study). Participants indicated at which time points they reported/recorded their activity completion, how confident they felt about their report at each of those time points (measured on a 5-point Likert scale, with responses ranging from Very Unsure to Very Sure), and whether they guessed while reporting (measured with a simple yes/no response).

However, in the Mobile Team condition, the proportion of participants whose overall compliance was around the left modal was reduced and most participants’ overall compliance was around 0.75 (right modal). This dichotomy in the distribution of overall compliance across Team versus Solo conditions suggests that the team social support-based intervention is more likely to shift individual user compliance closer to the team mean (ie, increase individual compliance). The challenge therefore to design more effective socially based health behavior interventions is to focus on increasing overall mean compliance in teams/groups of participants.</offsets></p><fig id="figure7" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="50999" xml_f="51007" txt_i="37409" txt_f="37417">Figure 7</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="51027" xml_f="51170" txt_i="37417" txt_f="37560">Kernel Density plots of average weekly compliance showing a bimodal distribution for both Mobile-Solo (Red) and Mobile-Team (Green) conditions.</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mhealth_v4i1e4_fig7"></graphic></fig></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="51260" xml_f="51301" txt_i="37562" txt_f="37603">RH3: Greater Adherence in Team Conditions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="51312" xml_f="51490" txt_i="37604" txt_f="37782">Based on the self-reported compliance data, adherence of the ePaper groups was high.

Furthermore, participants’ overall attitude toward the program had a significant effect on participants’ adherence, which supports the notion that efforts to enhance positive attitudes toward these health behavior change programs can greatly increase their impact.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="60939" xml_f="61747" txt_i="43546" txt_f="44354">Our second specific study aim was to assess whether media types (ePaper vs Mobile) were associated with different levels of compliance and adherence to wellness programs. We found that participants in the ePaper conditions reported a much higher compliance score. However, the confidence in the compliance report in the ePaper condition was much lower than in the Mobile condition, while the attrition rate was higher in the ePaper condition. One major factor that could have led to this behavioral discrepancy between the 2 conditions is that the affordance of the Mobile app is much lower to support back-reporting in time, which is not the case with the ePaper workbook. This could have led to possible over-reporting in the ePaper condition precisely due to the easy access of the entire ePaper workbook.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="61754" xml_f="61820" txt_i="44355" txt_f="44421">These findings are consistent with those of Stone and colleagues [</offsets><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="61854" xml_f="61856" txt_i="44421" txt_f="44423">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="61863" xml_f="62363" txt_i="44423" txt_f="44923">] who also found that patients maintaining ePaper medication diaries showed a higher frequency of back-reporting or “hoarding.” These results may provide additional support for the use of mobile diaries for patients/users wherein closer tracking of long-term behaviors are required. It also highlights the need for objective measurement of adherence to behavioral treatment regimens, which in the context of physical activity interventions can potentially be achieved with wearable activity trackers.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="62370" xml_f="63530" txt_i="44924" txt_f="46084">The third aim was to assess whether the use of Fittle led to positive changes to participants’ eating behaviors, physical activity, and stress level. The results revealed that participants all reported some positive changes in Healthy Eating, Perceived Stress Scale, and MET, except that participants in the Mobile Solo condition reported higher Perceived Stress Scale at the end of the study. No significant effects of media or team type were found for the changes observed in Perceived Stress Scale and MET. However, as for Healthy Eating, participants in ePaper conditions reported more improvements than participants in Mobile conditions. The reason for these results is unclear, and it is not explainable given our study design. One possibility is that the higher attrition in the ePaper groups could have been related to less motivated participants dropping out, leaving a more-motivated ePaper cohort to participate for the study duration. On the contrary, the mobile app may have retained a less-motivated cohort who would have otherwise had less compliance and, consequently, these less-motivated participants did not see the expected health benefits.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="63552" xml_f="63563" txt_i="46086" txt_f="46097">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="63574" xml_f="63992" txt_i="46098" txt_f="46516">Generalizability of the initial findings from this feasibility study is limited given that the sample was mostly white and female.

This higher attrition rate may be due to the fact that the Fittle app was a work-in-progress app. Participants held more positive attitudes toward the ePaper-based program than the app-based program.
