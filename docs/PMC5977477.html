All sessions are carried out with the focus on step-by-step work and safety; for instance, can music pieces connected to safety imagery or positive resources alternate with pieces of music accompanying trauma memory. Traumatic episodes can be renegotiated during music listening, meaning that the patient finds alternative solutions in imagery to a stuck situation in the past, and/or that incomplete defense actions (fight and flight) can be carried out in the imagination.

Any need for additional treatment is assessed by the clinical team. If additional psychotherapeutic treatment is needed, the participant is excluded from follow-up measurement. All participants who have completed the protocol are invited to a 6-month follow-up session, where questionnaires and saliva samples are collected, with an external psychologist assisting in scoring HTQ, and a trained translator, who is blinded to the affiliation, assisting in scoring the remaining questionnaires</offsets></p></list-item></list><offsets xml_i="67362" xml_f="67363" txt_i="53058" txt_f="53059">

Music therapy is a relatively new treatment modality for refugees, and the art of choosing music for the right phase of treatment is still being developed. According to the pilot study, the treatment method is not harmful when used with care and ongoing attunement to the needs of the patient, but the music therapists must pay attention to avoid adverse reactions in case of hypersensitivity to sound, restimulation of trauma by using too loud or dynamic pieces of music, or restimulation of trauma in former musicians or persons who have been tortured with sound or music. Music listening that triggers trauma memory has been found to happen frequently and, therefore, the music therapists have to be specifically trained when working with this clinical group. Trauma exposure with music is very effective, but it requires that both the patient and the therapist can work together to keep arousal at a manageable level.

Hence, calm music and speaking combined with a thorough attunement to the patient might activate the social engagement system, lead to down-regulation of arousal, and enable the patient to unfreeze and experience aliveness and energy.</offsets></p><p id="Par133"><offsets xml_i="85836" xml_f="86729" txt_i="69515" txt_f="70408">The use of music in trauma treatment serves as a way to build up inner resources in the patient necessary for working through the trauma story, such as positive memories, a feeling of strength, a safe place, or the aesthetic experience of music. Exposure is part of many trauma therapies and includes the narration of the trauma story, the re-imagination being part of this retelling. When the narration of trauma episodes is accompanied by music, the music serves both as a holding and structuring framework that keeps the patient from fragmenting. It also helps the stimulation of imagery so that the recalling of trauma memory can change from being stuck in repetitive flashback. With the music as a support, processing of trauma fragments can take place at an implicit level of body sensation and imagery formation, a symbolization process where the memory is transformed into a metaphor [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98"><offsets xml_i="86762" xml_f="86764" txt_i="70408" txt_f="70410">98</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="86771" xml_f="86773" txt_i="70410" txt_f="70412">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99"><offsets xml_i="86806" xml_f="86808" txt_i="70412" txt_f="70414">99</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="86815" xml_f="87404" txt_i="70414" txt_f="71003">]. The ability to symbolize an experience allows it to be installed as memory that can be placed in the past instead of occurring as a recurrent flashback experienced as real time. When working with imagination to music, it also seems that the memory of a traumatic episode sometimes begins to transform and the patient imagines a new solution; for example, of escape, control or victory, that allows for the completion of fight and flight actions that were impossible to carry out at the time of the trauma, which, according to Peter Levine, is at the core of the trauma-healing process [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100"><offsets xml_i="87438" xml_f="87441" txt_i="71003" txt_f="71006">100</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="87448" xml_f="87450" txt_i="71006" txt_f="71008">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101"><offsets xml_i="87484" xml_f="87487" txt_i="71008" txt_f="71011">101</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="87494" xml_f="87496" txt_i="71011" txt_f="71013">].</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title><offsets xml_i="87529" xml_f="87541" txt_i="71015" txt_f="71027">Risk of bias</offsets></title><p id="Par134"><offsets xml_i="87564" xml_f="88529" txt_i="71028" txt_f="71993">In a psychotherapy trial such as this, it is often not possible to blind the intervention of the participants, and there can be an influence of their knowledge of being in the intervention or the control group. However, in this trial we investigate two types of treatment in a single clinic with equal dose (16 sessions) and equal weight as primary trauma treatment modalities. According to concealment of allocation, the randomization procedure is generated by computer software at Sealed Envelope, and none of the researchers have any influence over the procedure. Baseline tests are carried out before randomization, so that the allocation does not influence the measurement. Psychologists carrying out data collection concerning the primary outcome measure at post and follow-up times are concealed to the allocation (and the patients are not asked about it). Imbalances between treatment groups are prevented by the use of stratification (gender and location).</offsets></p><p id="Par135"><offsets xml_i="88548" xml_f="89242" txt_i="71994" txt_f="72688">As music therapists carry out the information meetings and measurement, the participants might be more motivated for music therapy than standard treatment (comparator), and be more likely to drop out from standard treatment. This could possibly influence the results in favor of music therapy. Adherence to the treatment is secured, as none of the participants can cross over to the other group. If a patient drops out from music therapy and is offered standard treatment, they are excluded from follow-up. If participants are offered other types of treatment in the clinic parallel to the assigned treatment, this will be monitored and an analysis of any group differences will be carried out.</offsets></p><p id="Par136"><offsets xml_i="89261" xml_f="89583" txt_i="72689" txt_f="73011">Protocol fidelity is assured by data collection of the therapist notes for all sessions, by team supervision and frequent meetings between music therapists and psychologists and in the group of music therapy researchers.

According to the treatment recommendations for complex PTSD mentioned in the academic literature review, adequate length of treatment is in the range from 1 to 2 years, compared to our timeframe of 4 to 6 months. Very few of in the target population have simple forms of PTSD, where short-term standard treatments have been proven effective. As studies have shown, complex forms of PTSD and compromised attachment are prevalent in the population. However, the trial is conducted within the premises of Psychiatry in Region Zealand, where the countrywide recommendations are followed. Those recommendations are currently updated. This means that we cannot expect large effect sizes.</offsets></p><p id="Par139"><offsets xml_i="90477" xml_f="91293" txt_i="73834" txt_f="74650">Ongoing stressors in participants’ worlds include news and video footage of current bombings of people in their home town or where their friends or family live, confusion about the explicit and implicit rules and norms in their host society, exhaustion from having to follow language training and workplace practice with ongoing PTSD symptoms as well as raising children on a minimal budget, and last but not least the alienation of witnessing a hostile tone towards them from governments as well as citizens in the public news. Such elements make it very difficult to construct a social and psychological space suitable for healing past trauma. Overall, this contributes to a lesser effect size, but the load is spread unevenly and the aim should be to record the most important of these circumstances in each case.</offsets></p><p id="Par140"><offsets xml_i="91312" xml_f="93063" txt_i="74651" txt_f="76402">Translators are used with participants, who find it beneficial. In a translated session, the verbal information passed is little less than half of that of a session without, as everything has to be said twice and quite often there is necessary conversation about the meaning of a single sentence. Consequently, the doses of therapy for participants with translators are not comparable to those without translators. There are often limits to the conversation with the translator, who might be a young and relatively inexperienced person with a limited vocabulary on matters relating to psychotherapy and trauma in either one of the languages used. Many of the Arabic-speaking participants do not have Arabic as their mother tongue. There is no officially approved education for translators, the clinic is not free to choose the best available translators, but is bound by an exclusivity contract with one vendor. Most of the translators are bi-lingual persons without any formal training as translator or any higher education in either language. The translator brings their own presence into the therapy room and the therapeutic dyad effectively becomes a triad. The official goal of the translator is not to be personally present, but in a psychotherapy session, where the implicit is just as important as the explicit, this becomes impossible, and the best implicitly present translator is the one who can join the atmosphere that develops in the session and not stick to a rigid pretence of not being there. It follows that translation alone is a complex phenomenon that influences outcome more for some clients and not at all for those who do not use translators. Furthermore, it perhaps influences music therapy and standard treatment differently.</offsets></p><p id="Par141"><offsets xml_i="93082" xml_f="93613" txt_i="76403" txt_f="76934">The use of the interdisciplinary team during the course of treatment according to individual needs means that some participants receive more treatment than others, especially so for participants needing physiotherapy or body therapy (psychomotorical therapy). This is usually prescribed for patients having specific and disturbing physical symptoms. Also, advice from a social worker helps clarify issues with authorities and other professionals. The amount of extra treatment and counseling is monitored and recorded in each case.</offsets></p><p id="Par142"><offsets xml_i="93632" xml_f="94544" txt_i="76935" txt_f="77847">Another limitation is the broadness of standard treatment; as the psychologists in the clinic work with an integrative approach, it is not possible in this study to compare music therapy with a standardized or manualized psychological treatment. As described in the intervention section, the main perspectives adapted in the clinic are a flexible adaptation of CBT to severely traumatized patients from diverse cultures and narrative therapy (which is focused on helping the patient to create a narrative of the life story that helps them to be able to make meaning and live on after trauma; it is by the way not the same as NET). In reviews of psychological treatment with refugees, the two treatments with highest effect sizes are culturally sensitive CBT and NET, but they have been conducted almost exclusively by the same two groups of researchers, and have been criticized for having low-quality evidence [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12"><offsets xml_i="94577" xml_f="94579" txt_i="77847" txt_f="77849">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="94586" xml_f="94995" txt_i="77849" txt_f="78258">]. Studies of other types of intervention, including multimodal therapy, reach an average medium-large effect size, and this is also what we will expect from the outcomes of the present study.
