It is managed most commonly by drug therapy, followed by various behavioral interventions and, less frequently, by surgical methods. Each of these methods, however, has variable efficacy and adverse effects. Classically, urge incontinence has been considered most important, being the key index in treatment outcome assessments. However, since the new consensus by the International Continence Society on the diagnosis of OAB (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="6307" xml_f="6308" txt_i="2272" txt_f="2273">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6315" xml_f="6591" txt_i="2273" txt_f="2549">), the presence or absence of actual urine leakage was regarded as less important.

We excluded patients with active urinary tract infection, clinically significant stress urinary incontinence, bladder outlet obstruction, interstitial cystitis, glaucoma or megacolon.

In addition, each patient kept a record of urgency scores, with 0 indicating no symptoms, 1 rarely, 2 occasionally, 3 often, and 4 all the time, and a frequency-volume chart. At 12 weeks, satisfaction score was assessed, with 0 representing fully satisfied, 1 much improved, 2 slightly improved, 3 no improvement, and 4 worsened; a change of 2 points or more was considered symptom improvement.

Gross and functional anatomy of the lower urinary tract and pelvis were demonstrated, with instructions on how bladder drills can increase functional bladder capacity and actual voiding habits. Each patient was instructed to examine her frequency-volume chart to determine the longest interval she could initially hold urination and sustain urge symptoms. Each patient was then taught to increase this interval by 15-min increments, with the aim of achieving a 3 to 4 hr interval and a voided volume of 300 to 400 mL. In addition, whenever urgency occurred, patients were educated to perform Kegel exercises for symptom alleviation.

Accordingly, the exercise program that we used did not simply require patients to contract and relax their pelvic floor muscles for certain periods of time. Instead, patients were given specific goals of 15 min each in sustaining contractions and were instructed how to increase these intervals.

In this study, we found that patient adherence to treatment was lowest and discontinuation rate highest in the BT group, although the treatment efficacy results were similar at the end of 12 weeks. This may be attributed to the longer duration of patient maneuvering required before experiencing significant improvement in this BT-only group. Thus, despite many efforts by the physician to make patients stay on the correct treatment regimen, it was evidently easier for patients to take medication twice a day than to repeat exercises many times a day for months.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18018" xml_f="18318" txt_i="12935" txt_f="13235">We noted no adverse effects in the BT group, whereas, in the other 2 groups, the most common adverse effect was dry mouth. We found that 6.3% of patients in the BT group and 6.5% in the Co group had to discontinue medication due to severe dry mouth, percentages lower than those previously reported (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"><offsets xml_i="18350" xml_f="18352" txt_i="13235" txt_f="13237">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18359" xml_f="18361" txt_i="13237" txt_f="13239">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="18393" xml_f="18395" txt_i="13239" txt_f="13241">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18402" xml_f="18499" txt_i="13241" txt_f="13338">).

Since a short-term intensive course of bladder drill is as effective as medical or combined therapy in all voiding symptoms, but does not have any adverse effects, bladder training can be safely and effectively employed as first line treatment for OAB. In patients who have predominantly symptoms of frequency or urgency, tolterodine may be more effective, especially when combined with bladder training.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Milsom</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Abrams</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Cardozo</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name><name><surname>Thuroff</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Wein</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>How widespread are the symptoms of an overactive bladder and how are they managed?
