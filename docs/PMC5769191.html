One example of such studies was a research that was conducted in America in 2010, titled: “Evaluating the correlation between the perceived stress, acupuncture, and the pregnancy rate among patients undergoing IVF treatment.” This study was conducted on 57 infertile women who were undergoing IVF treatment and were assigned into two groups of intervention and control.

In other words, the stress factor has not been taken into consideration throughout the whole therapy. On the other hand, there have not been sufficient studies to shade some light on the effect of auriculotherapy and the outcome of infertility. Therefore, considering the significant issue of infertility and its impact on personal, social, mental, and economic aspects of life, and the need to find complementary therapies which are safe, effective, and economic, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of auriculotherapy on the stress and the outcome of infertility treatment in patients undergoing assisted reproductive treatment.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title><offsets xml_i="13282" xml_f="13303" txt_i="7775" txt_f="7796">Materials and Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="13314" xml_f="14614" txt_i="7797" txt_f="9097">The present study was a two-group three-stage clinical trial with the registration code IRCT20159182889N6, which was conducted on 56 infertile women who referred to Om-e-Leila fertility and infertility clinic in Bandar Abbas, Iran, from November 2014 to November 2015. By considering a 95% confidence interval and 80% test power, the estimated sample size for each group was 30 people. The participants in the present study were 20 to 45-year-old women who had infertility due to ovarian disorders, had at least one failed IVF treatment, had gone through IVF therapy for the second time, and participated in the study having full consent. At the beginning of the study (one menstrual cycle before IVF) through conducting interviews and close examination of their medical records, patient's nonmorbidity to uterine structural disorders, systematic diseases, and healthiness of the external ear were ensured. Further examination was also carried out to make sure patients have not been recently diagnosed or previously undergone any anxiety treatment. Interruption of the treatment during the intended menstrual cycle due to lack of embryo formation in the lab, occurrence of intense stressful situations, and patient's unwillingness to continue cooperation were among exclusion criteria in this study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14621" xml_f="16214" txt_i="9098" txt_f="10691">In the present study, participants were selected through convenient sampling. Nonsynchronized treatment sessions were arranged for both groups to avoid unintended conversations and observations between members that could eventually lead to the formation of wrong beliefs or unusual increase of anxiety among patients in the control group; thus, randomization was not conducted. Therefore, sampling was initially done for the control group, and when it was completed, it was done for the intervention group. After close examination of the inclusion criteria, 33 people entered the control group from whom 3 people were eventually excluded due to lack of cooperation in completing the questionnaire, and thus the collected data from 30 people were finally analyzed. After the completion of this stage, according to the inclusion criteria, 32 people entered the intervention group from whom one person was excluded due to lack of cooperation, and five more people were excluded due to cancellation of the treatment for reasons such as lack of embryo formation in the lab, etc. Thus, the data collected from 26 people were finally analyzed. Data collection tools include demographic and fertility questionnaire plus Newton's Fertility Problem Inventory. Newton's Problem Inventory is a multidimensional, 46-item questionnaire that studies infertile women's concerns over five aspects in life.

This group completed the questionnaire at three stages: prior to their admission in the study, before the embryo transfer, and before performing the pregnancy test. In the first cycle of the treatment (one cycle before performing IVF), the intervention group received two sessions of auriculotherapy for 2 weeks. The total number of 6–8 sessions of auriculotherapy was conducted by the researcher. Also, in the second cycle of the treatment (the cycle of performing IVF), 2–4 sessions of auriculotherapy were conducted prior to embryo transfer stage. Eventually, the total number of 8–12 sessions was conducted for each patient. In this study, due to some reasons, auriculotherapy sessions were not proceeded any further after the embryo transfer stage. Firstly, comprehensive and sufficient documents could not be found to back up the project design on how auriculotherapy or acupuncture can affect the implantation and growth of the embryo after it has been transferred. Secondly, the general common belief among patients undergoing IVF is that after the embryo has been transferred, they should have full rest; whereas, conducting auriculotherapy sessions requires patients to visit the infertility center repeatedly. This plus other factors such as patient's lack of cooperation, the possibility of high-rate embryonic loss, the existence of stress in patients, and finally the possibility of partiality in the final results led to the cessation of intervention before the embryo transfer stage. Each auriculotherapy session lasted almost 30 min during which the associated points in the ovary, uterine, adrenal, endocrine system, brain, abdomen, pelvis, the immunity system, and the stress and relaxation points were stimulated for 10–15 seconds using Pointer Excel device. At the end of each session for the intervention group, the seeds were placed on specific points of the participant's ears, then they were trained on how to keep pressuring those points (every hour for 1 min). This group like the control group completed the Newton's Problem Inventory questionnaire at three stages. Patients were informed of the pregnancy test results through phone calls or visiting the center. If the result was positive, mothers were reminded of their next visit (next month) to have an ultrasound scan, performed by a specialist.

This could probably be due to some reasons; firstly, there was an interval of 2 weeks between embryo transfer and pregnancy test stages. Considering the unknown effect of auriculotherapy on the implantation and growth of the embryo, intervention was not conducted. That might explain why patients stress score remained unchanged during this time period. Secondly, the interval from embryo transfer stage to pregnancy test stage is about 2 weeks; whereas, the interval time from the first treatment cycle (beginning of the intervention) until embryo transfer stage varies according to the treatment protocol, but it could last for almost 6 weeks. Therefore, different intervals could be another reason why patient's stress score has remained unchanged.

Having said that, midwives who work at infertility centers can learn the necessary skills to perform auriculotherapy on infertile patients.
