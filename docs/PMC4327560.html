A few limitations deserve mention. First, imbalance in terms of baseline characteristics across study groups (WHO performance status, prior SSA use, and time since initial diagnosis) could have confounded the study outcomes. Second, in the prior chemotherapy group, the type of chemotherapy received by patients varied; however, previously mentioned ongoing studies, such as SEQTOR, will clarify study results in terms of individual agents. Lastly, the RADIANT-3 study enrolled patients who demonstrated disease progression before study entry but did not mandate progression while they received chemotherapy. Therefore, the patients in the prior chemotherapy group might have had tumors sensitive to chemotherapy at the time of enrollment. Nevertheless, the efficacy of everolimus in patients who experienced disease progression while on chemotherapy has been demonstrated in the phase II RADIANT-1 study.</offsets><sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34115" xml_f="34117" txt_i="23814" txt_f="23816">10</offsets></xref></sup></p><p><offsets xml_i="34137" xml_f="34571" txt_i="23817" txt_f="24251">In conclusion, the selection of specific subgroups of patients who would best respond to chemotherapy or everolimus in first-line treatment is an ongoing challenge for the treatment of patients with pNET. The present RADIANT-3 subgroup analysis demonstrates that patients with pNET benefit from everolimus regardless of prior chemotherapy use and suggests the potential for first-line use of everolimus in patients with advanced pNET.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Jennifer M.
