Thus, more albumins only increase albumin accumulation that is cleared off through lymphatic system. Isotonic crystalloid fluids are effective augmentation of plasma volume for resuscitation. Crystalloid advocates argue that crystalloids are cheap and their side effects are rare. Non-existence of allergic reactions, coagulopathy, and tissue accumulation are the advantages of crystalloids. In contrast, arguments in favor of colloids explain that oncotic pressure of plasma proteins in revival with crystalloid solutions leads to filtered fluids from intravascular to the interstitial space leading to edema in the digestive system. The administration of colloids after acute hemorrhage results in faster improvement of filling pressures, arterial blood pressure and heart rate.
