Health care regulators and payers are now tying patient safety outcomes and best practices to hospital reimbursement. Many health care leaders are searching for new technologies that not only make health care for patients safer but also reduce overall health care costs. New advances in ultrasonography have made this technology available to health care providers at the patient's bedside. Point-of-care ultrasound assistance now aids providers with real-time diagnosis and with visualization for procedural guidance.[</offsets><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="5921" xml_f="5922" txt_i="2556" txt_f="2557">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5929" xml_f="5930" txt_i="2557" txt_f="2558">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5937" xml_f="6790" txt_i="2559" txt_f="3412">Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is the technique of injecting local anesthetic adjacent to the intervertebral foramina, resulting in unilateral somatic and sympathetic nerve blockade. Previous studies have reported its effectiveness for thoracic surgery including breast surgery and relief of postoperative and chronic pain of unilateral origin from the chest and abdomen. The technique is relatively easy to learn and safer than a thoracic epidural. Its clinical advantages include the inhibition of stress and pressor responses to surgical stimuli, maintenance of hemodynamic stability, low incidence of complication, long duration of analgesia, and few contraindications. Recent advances in ultrasound technology can further increase the effectiveness and the safety of TPVB although identification of the nerve and needle is not still possible.[</offsets><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6823" xml_f="6824" txt_i="3412" txt_f="3413">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6831" xml_f="6832" txt_i="3413" txt_f="3414">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6839" xml_f="7033" txt_i="3415" txt_f="3609">Needle visualization is important for safe and successful ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block.
