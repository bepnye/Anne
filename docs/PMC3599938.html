To recruit patients into the SCOPE trial, potentially eligible patients (that is aged 50 to 70 years old) received a personalized, mailed invitation signed by their primary care physician to take part in colorectal cancer screening.

Our findings are consistent with other randomized trials that have compared telephone-based reminders to alternative methods (no reminder or mail reminder) and found that telephone-based methods can increase recruitment by nearly two-fold

We enrolled 66% more patients (in relative terms), or 4.9% more patients in absolute terms, using telephone follow-up with initial non-responders than by mail follow-up, translating to a ânumber needed to callâ of approximately 20. Because telephone follow-up is likely to be more resource intensive than mail-based follow-up, investigators will need to weigh the costs and benefits of a telephone-based recruitment strategy.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21469" xml_f="23887" txt_i="15065" txt_f="17483">This study has some limitations. Firstly, the patients eligible for this study were non-responders to the initial mail invitations. This may potentially skew the results of the mail follow-up group as these patients have already been shown to be non-responsive to the initial mail invitations. Therefore, it is possible that an initial telephone-based invitation, as opposed to an initial mail-based invitation, could achieve greater results than what we observed in this study. Secondly, we did not measure the costs of each follow-up strategy in our study and did not systematically collect data on the percentage of patients who agreed to undergo the eligibility screening after each round of telephone calls, which would have helped us to estimate the cost and time for the telephone follow-up group. As such, we are unable to conduct a formal cost-benefit analysis. However, our results indicate that, as long as telephone follow-up can be conducted at less than 66% greater cost per invitation than mail follow-up (in relative terms), the cost per patient recruited would be lower with telephone follow-up. Thirdly, the telephone follow-up group received up to three attempts for contact compared to only one attempt in the mail follow-up group. Although from a logistic point of view, it made sense to call more than once before abandoning efforts to make contact with a potential participant, the different number of attempts in each group may have contributed to the lower response rate in the mail follow-up group. Thus, we make no comment about the relative effectiveness of making a single telephone call versus a single mail reminder to increase recruitment into a randomized controlled trial. Finally, the sample size of this substudy was restricted to only 952 subjects due to the premature termination of the larger SCOPE trial. However, this substudy of recruitment strategies (mail versus telephone reminders) was not stopped early based on the findings (that is it was not stopped early for benefit of either mail or telephone reminders). Despite the smaller sample size, the effect size we observed was sufficiently large (relative risk of 1.92) to be statistically significant and the only impact of our reduced sample size was greater imprecision around our point estimate of effect for the primary outcome (that is, wider 95% CI than we would have otherwise obtained with a larger study sample).</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="23932" xml_f="23943" txt_i="17485" txt_f="17496">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23954" xml_f="24356" txt_i="17497" txt_f="17899">We found that telephone-based follow-up led to a greater recruitment rate than mail-based follow-up of individuals who did not respond to an initial mailed invitation to take part in an RCT of colorectal cancer screening.
