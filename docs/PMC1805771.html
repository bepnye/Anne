In contrast, the expectancy theory is based on the patient expectations. The response to a stimulus depends on what response is expected from the stimulus.

There were differences between responses from naïve and non-naive participants for the statement "I believe this treatment would allow me to get better quicker," after viewing the ultrasound treatment.

Measuring expectations of benefits after viewing a two minute demonstration of a treatment cannot replace measuring expectations of benefits after actually receiving a treatment. Further research into the placebo effect, particularly for manipulative treatments, is needed. The most appropriate placebo for OMT clinical trials cannot be truly determined until a better understanding of treatment expectation, physician/patient interaction in osteopathic medicine, other factors involved in the placebo effect, and a patient's experience with manipulative treatment is achieved. A point of interest would be to determine if the amount of prior experience with manipulative treatment is correlated with treatment expectations. Additionally, prior experience with manipulative treatment may have different effects across different countries with variations in OMT practitioner training. The video demonstrations also do not control for the effect of touch or sound during the treatments. Actually applying the sub-therapeutic ultrasound on the skin with gel could potentially change treatment expectations. The presented results, however, provide an elementary analysis of potential placebo treatments in OMT clinical trials and provide the opportunity to seek funding for more definitive research studies. The next step is to research the way participants respond to these issues after actually experiencing OMT and placebo treatments.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37378" xml_f="37388" txt_i="27447" txt_f="27457">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37399" xml_f="38467" txt_i="27458" txt_f="28526">This pilot study presents valuable elementary information for selecting an appropriate placebo when conducting OMT clinical trials. Effect sizes between HVLA and two possible placebo treatments are provided. These effect sizes can be used to help determine sample size estimations for future projects involving either a light touch or sub-therapeutic ultrasound placebo group as compared to an HVLA treatment group. Results of this pilot study suggest that expectations of the sub-therapeutic ultrasound placebo treatment are more similar to expectations of the HVLA treatment. Thus, using a sub-therapeutic ultrasound placebo may allow for a more optimal opportunity to identify a true treatment versus placebo effect. Additionally, it is important to control for prior experience with the various treatments, as those who are not naïve to manipulative treatment may have greater treatment expectations. The authors recommend either excluding subjects who have had OMT or chiropractic treatment or at least using statistical analyses to control for potential effects.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38489" xml_f="38508" txt_i="28528" txt_f="28547">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38519" xml_f="38579" txt_i="28548" txt_f="28608">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38601" xml_f="38623" txt_i="28610" txt_f="28632">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38634" xml_f="39170" txt_i="28633" txt_f="29169">KGF participated in the design of the project, recruited subjects, collected data, performed the statistical analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
