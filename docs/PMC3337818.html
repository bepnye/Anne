recommended by the World Health Organization based on evidence that it reduces mortality. There has been considerable interest in determining the benefits of neonatal vitamin A supplementation, but the results of existing trials are conflicting. A technical consultation convened by WHO pointed to the need for larger scale studies in Asia and Africa to inform global policy on the use of neonatal vitamin A supplementation. Three trials were therefore initiated in Ghana, India and Tanzania to determine if vitamin A supplementation (50,000 IU) given to neonates once orally on the day of birth or within the next two days will reduce mortality in the period from supplementation to 6 months of age compared to placebo.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8375" xml_f="8389" txt_i="810" txt_f="824">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8400" xml_f="9507" txt_i="825" txt_f="1932">The trials are individually randomized, double masked, and placebo controlled.

The study participants are neonates who fulfil age eligibility, whose families are likely to stay in the study area for the next 6 months, who are able to feed orally, and whose parent(s) provide informed written consent to participate in the study. Neonates randomized to the intervention group receive 50,000 IU vitamin A and the ones randomized to the control group receive placebo at the time of enrolment. Mortality and morbidity information are collected through periodic home visits by a study worker during infancy. The primary outcome of the study is mortality from supplementation to 6 months of age. The secondary outcome of the study is mortality from supplementation to 12 months of age. The three studies will be analysed independent of each other. Subgroup analysis will be carried out to determine the effect by birth weight, sex, and timing of DTP vaccine, socioeconomic groups and maternal large-dose vitamin A supplementation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9529" xml_f="9539" txt_i="1934" txt_f="1944">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9550" xml_f="9834" txt_i="1945" txt_f="2229">The three ongoing studies are the largest studies evaluating the efficacy of vitamin A supplementation to neonates.

The comparison is placebo with blinding achieved through numbered supplements. This is the most robust design available to ascertain efficacy of an intervention.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="55833" xml_f="56522" txt_i="44362" txt_f="45051">The primary outcome for this study was chosen to be mortality in the period from supplementation to 6 months of age. This was done because there is a policy on vitamin A supplementation in the second half of infancy in many developing countries, and the effects of the intervention (neonatal vitamin A supplementation) will be changed by this large supplement provided in the second half of infancy. However, two previous studies from Guinea-Bissau have suggested that the intervention may have a negative effect in the second half of infancy. Therefore, we have added mortality from supplementation until 12 months of age as a secondary outcome in consultation with the DSMB of the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="56529" xml_f="56571" txt_i="45052" txt_f="45094">We have several subgroup analysis decided </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="56579" xml_f="56587" txt_i="45094" txt_f="45102">a priori</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="56596" xml_f="57227" txt_i="45102" txt_f="45733">. These subgroup analyses are planned to confirm or refute hypotheses raised by previous studies and systematic reviews. A pooled analysis of two studies from Guinea-Bissau raised the hypothesis that the intervention may have a negative effect in girls, but a meta-analysis of all available trials did not find this interaction. The studies from Guinea-Bissau have also raised the hypothesis that effects may be different before or after the first dose of DTP immunization. A meta-analysis hypothesized that the effects may be different in low or normal birth weight infants and by the level of vitamin A deficiency in populations.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="57234" xml_f="57798" txt_i="45734" txt_f="46298">The biological rationale for the potential effect of neonatal vitamin A is not known. It has been hypothesized that the intervention could work through positively affecting the immune system or by promoting the maturation and integrity of the epithelium. A set of parallel animal and human studies is being conducted to understand the transport and metabolism of the neonatal vitamin A dose and its effects on the innate and adaptive immune system. These studies will shed more light on the potential biological mechanisms through which this intervention may work.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="57805" xml_f="58190" txt_i="46299" txt_f="46684">However, policy formulation will largely be based on the results of efficacy of the intervention from the ongoing randomized controlled trials. These results will be combined with results of previous studies in a new meta-analysis for an overall effect. The data from the three new studies, as well as previous studies if possible, will be pooled to carefully examine subgroup effects.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="58206" xml_f="58218" txt_i="46685" txt_f="46697">Trial status</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="58229" xml_f="58323" txt_i="46698" txt_f="46792">The trials are ongoing.
