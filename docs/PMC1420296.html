Also, students may have failed to apply/transfer the information management skills from the case-base discussions to the SP experience because the learning context changed from paper cases to a mock clinical encounter. In addition, students do not learn the clinical content (travel medicine) during any third year rotation, so we were testing on a content area that we had not formally taught. However, we deliberately chose this content because we considered that the lack of formal teaching 'leveled the playing field' for finding travel information that is easily retrieved from the Internet.

More concerning was the finding that most students indicated incorrectly that there was no potential interaction. Wrongly answering patients' questions without using readily available information systems is an important and preventable source of medical errors. Medical educators must teach learners to develop information management habits that reduce medical errors, including prescribing errors. At our institution, we will re-evaluate our teaching methods, with the specific aim of teaching students to check for medication interactions at every encounter. Future studies must investigate other educational interventions that demonstrate improvements in students' information management skills.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19899" xml_f="19918" txt_i="15711" txt_f="15730">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19929" xml_f="19989" txt_i="15731" txt_f="15791">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20011" xml_f="20033" txt_i="15793" txt_f="15815">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20044" xml_f="20255" txt_i="15816" txt_f="16027">HC conceived of the study, developed educational interventions and the standardized patient case, participated in its design and coordination, performed the statistical analysis, and helped write the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20262" xml_f="20414" txt_i="16028" txt_f="16180">AED participated in the conception and design of the study, educational interventions and standardized patient case, and helped to write the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20421" xml_f="20502" txt_i="16181" txt_f="16262">JD participated in the interpretation of data and helped to write the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20509" xml_f="20560" txt_i="16263" txt_f="16314">All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20582" xml_f="20605" txt_i="16316" txt_f="16339">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20616" xml_f="20680" txt_i="16340" txt_f="16404">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6920/6/14/prepub"></ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Carla Aamodt, MD and Ray Dahlberg, directors of the clinical skills laboratory for their assistance in refining the standardized patient case, recruiting and training standardized patients, and providing ongoing quality control of the standardized patient program.
