The findings of this study showed that average scores regarding discomfort before and after exposure to noise have significant relation with sound pressure levels. Of course, it is to be noted that as discomfort due to noise in this research was considered only at the beginning and at the end of the research, the effects of increasing discomfort due to noise could not be considered as only limited to sound pressure levels, but other reasons such as fatigue could affect discomfort and uneasiness due to relatively long-term confrontation with noise.

Comparing the rate of errors of the control group with other groups shows that the rate of error at sound pressure level of 95 dB in ‘A’ network is the highest at any exposure time, but it decreases initially and then gradually increases for 65 dB or 85 dB levels at any time. This result is in conformity with the studies made by Khan and Smith, who showed that sound may first have positive effects on performance, but in course of time with exposure to sound, this effect weakens.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23"><offsets xml_i="21314" xml_f="21316" txt_i="14878" txt_f="14880">23</offsets></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24"><offsets xml_i="21357" xml_f="21359" txt_i="14880" txt_f="14882">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21366" xml_f="21842" txt_i="14882" txt_f="15358">] The increase or decrease in the rate of error could be justified by the Yerkes and Dadson law. Yerkes and Dadson were two management theoreticians who presented the relation of stress and performance as the Yerkes and Dadson law. This law states that when stress is optimized, performance will be at its highest level. When stress is low or very high, performance is low, and only when stress is at an intermediate level and is optimized, the performance is at its maximum.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25"><offsets xml_i="21876" xml_f="21878" txt_i="15358" txt_f="15360">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21885" xml_f="22612" txt_i="15360" txt_f="16087">] According to this, it could be said that the sound played at sound pressure levels of 65 dB (A) and 85 dB (A) could create optimized stress in participants, in comparison with the control group and at the beginning of exposure to noise.

As the test of hand coordination is simple in nature, the sound pressure of 65 dB (A) and 85 dB (A) could improve efficiency in the tests in the beginning.
