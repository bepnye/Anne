The overall result of the low dose PSL sub-group in a log-rank test at the primary end-point was significantly higher in favor of True versus other two groups (p=0.433).

Accordingly, we believe that the monthly GMA should increase the long-term survival (without relapse) as indicated by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (p=0.0219, vs Sham; p=0.0439, vs Control). To see any contribution from AZA to the clinical efficacy associated with monthly GMA, we compared the results of patients on concomitant AZA with those without AZA in each of the three arms.

From the viewpoint of remission maintenance, we believe that it is significant to use a strategy, which is effective in inducing remission of the active disease, and then the same strategy should be used as maintenance therapy. It is also important to state that all patients of this study had a corticosteroid refractory background prior to remission induction therapy with weekly GMA. Furthermore, this was a prospective exploratory study with a total of 33 patients, which limits the statistical significance level.

Overall, compliance was good, and there was no severe adverse side effect in any arm. Transient flushing and lightheadedness were seen in a small number of patients associated with extracorporeal circulation.

In reference to patients who had their PSL dose tapered to &lt;20 mg/day by the end of the remission induction therapy with weekly GMA, the number of patients with steroid free remission was significantly in favor of GMA at week 48. This is to say that monthly GMA increased the probability of long-term remission in this population as indicated by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. To evaluate the contribution of AZA, we compared the results between patients with and those without concomitant AZA in each of the 3 arms. Unlike the situation with PSL, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis did not show beneficial effect for concomitant AZA. This is not surprising given that only 6 patients were on AZA at the randomization (in Japan, AZA was officially approved for UC patients in June 2006).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24057" xml_f="24134" txt_i="17119" txt_f="17196">Since the publication of the first clinical trial on GMA in patients with UC,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="24165" xml_f="24166" txt_i="17196" txt_f="17197">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24173" xml_f="24218" txt_i="17197" txt_f="17242"> a large number of papers, mostly from Japan,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="24250" xml_f="24252" txt_i="17242" txt_f="17244">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24259" xml_f="24260" txt_i="17244" txt_f="17245">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><offsets xml_i="24292" xml_f="24294" txt_i="17245" txt_f="17247">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24301" xml_f="24302" txt_i="17247" txt_f="17248">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="24334" xml_f="24336" txt_i="17248" txt_f="17250">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24343" xml_f="24344" txt_i="17250" txt_f="17251">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"><offsets xml_i="24376" xml_f="24378" txt_i="17251" txt_f="17253">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24385" xml_f="24407" txt_i="17253" txt_f="17275"> but also from Europe,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="24439" xml_f="24441" txt_i="17275" txt_f="17277">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24448" xml_f="24449" txt_i="17277" txt_f="17278">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"><offsets xml_i="24481" xml_f="24483" txt_i="17278" txt_f="17280">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24490" xml_f="24491" txt_i="17280" txt_f="17281">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="24523" xml_f="24525" txt_i="17281" txt_f="17283">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24532" xml_f="24544" txt_i="17283" txt_f="17295"> and the USA</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="24575" xml_f="24576" txt_i="17295" txt_f="17296">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24583" xml_f="24584" txt_i="17296" txt_f="17297">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="24616" xml_f="24618" txt_i="17297" txt_f="17299">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24625" xml_f="24626" txt_i="17299" txt_f="17300">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="24658" xml_f="24660" txt_i="17300" txt_f="17302">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24667" xml_f="24724" txt_i="17302" txt_f="17359"> have reported varying efficacy outcomes ranging from 85%</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="24756" xml_f="24758" txt_i="17359" txt_f="17361">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24765" xml_f="24805" txt_i="17361" txt_f="17401"> to a statistically insignificant level.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="24836" xml_f="24837" txt_i="17401" txt_f="17402">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24844" xml_f="24868" txt_i="17402" txt_f="17426"> Except for four studies</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="24899" xml_f="24900" txt_i="17426" txt_f="17427">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24907" xml_f="24908" txt_i="17427" txt_f="17428">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="24939" xml_f="24940" txt_i="17428" txt_f="17429">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24947" xml_f="24948" txt_i="17429" txt_f="17430">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="24980" xml_f="24982" txt_i="17430" txt_f="17432">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24989" xml_f="24990" txt_i="17432" txt_f="17433">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="25022" xml_f="25024" txt_i="17433" txt_f="17435">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25031" xml_f="25101" txt_i="17435" txt_f="17505"> all other studies did not include Control arms.

However, monthly GMA appeared to increase the probability of AR in the long term, especially in patients who had reduce their PSL dosage to &lt;20 mg/day at the start of maintenance therapy. Therefore, monthly intervention with GMA potentially should prevent UC relapse without compromising safety.
