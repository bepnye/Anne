For this reason, delivery of an anesthetic can be limited when regional anesthesia is administered at the inferior site rather than the branching-out site. In some cases, the distance between the tibial nerve and the commom peroneal nerve is several centimeters apart, and the regional anesthesia cannot cover this whole distance. Moreover, the fat layer and connective tissues within the popliteal fossa space interfere with the flow of the anesthetic and delay the time of action. This can induce individual time differences to the complete block or cause incomplete block.

Possible causes were exposed peroneal nerve and sural nerve damage, nerve toxicity of the local anesthesia, direct nerve damage and ischemia, and blockage of the local anesthetic flow in relation to the tourniquet. Despite the small chance, patients should be informed about such side effects. Those who require an appropriate anesthetic procedure need close monitoring for the incidence of side effects, and more investigation is warranted to decide on the ideal anesthetic procedure.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23460" xml_f="24252" txt_i="18414" txt_f="19206">In the patient satisfaction survey, PSNB was shown to have relatively high satisfaction compared with spinal anesthesia. This can be explained by the incidence of back pain from spinal anesthesia and various side effects during and after surgery, as these played important roles in reducing patients' satisfaction. Aside from 2 patients who developed PDPH, 5 patients (25%) indicated they were "very dissatisfied" due to back pain. In the PSNB group, satisfaction was low among patients who experienced pain at the needle insertion site, a longer procedural time, and pain under discission. These differences in the satisfaction levels would be greater if comparisons were made with a 26 G needle, a thicker needle, in the spinal anesthesia group or with a higher amount of spinal anesthesia.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24259" xml_f="24907" txt_i="19207" txt_f="19855">The satisfaction survey about postoperative pain control after sciatic nerve catheterization could not be used for the comparative study because patients with the spinal anesthetic rejected the use of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) or the use of various methods of post-surgical pain control. However, in PSNB patients who used a PCA due to catheter insertion around the sciatic nerve, there was no incidence of side effects such as nausea and vomiting, which were common in those who recieved IV PCA or oral administration.

There were individual variations in the time to complete the nerve block, but PSNB was determined as relatively safe, provided an appropriate level of anesthesia, reduced possible side effects from the spinal anesthesia, and showed excellent results on postoperative pain control. The authors suggest that PSNB be considered as the anesthetic procedure for hallux valgus surgery anesthesia and for postoperative pain control, especially in patients for whom spinal anesthesia is not feasible.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
