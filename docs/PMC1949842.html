However, there are few documented experiences from African countries.

Pregnant women enrolled in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire received either HAART for their own health or short-course antiretroviral (scARV) PMTCT regimens according to their clinical and immunological status. Plasma HIV-RNA viral load (VL) was measured to diagnose peripartum infection when infants were 4 wk of age, and HIV final status was documented either by rapid antibody testing when infants were aged ≥ 12 mo or by plasma VL earlier. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the rate of HIV transmission and HIV-free survival. Between August 2003 and June 2005, 107 women began HAART at a median of 30 wk of gestation, 102 of them with zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and nevirapine (NVP) and they continued treatment postpartum; 143 other women received scARV for PMTCT, 103 of them with sc(ZDV+3TC) with single-dose NVP during labour. Most (75%) of the infants were breast-fed for a median of 5 mo. Overall, the rate of peripartum HIV transmission was 2.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3%–4.2%) and the cumulative rate at 12 mo was 5.7% (95% CI 2.5%–9.0%). The overall probability of infant death or infection with HIV was 4.3% (95% CI 1.7%–7.0%) at age week 4 wk and 11.7% (95% CI 7.5%–15.9%) at 12 mo.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st3"><title><offsets xml_i="8450" xml_f="8461" txt_i="2026" txt_f="2037">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8472" xml_f="8721" txt_i="2038" txt_f="2287">This two-tiered strategy appears to be safe and highly effective for short- and long-term PMTCT in resource-constrained settings.

Usually, anti-HIV medication is recommended only for those whose immune systems have been significantly affected by the virus, as evidenced by symptoms or by the results of a blood test, the CD4 lymphocyte (“T cell”) count. Treating HIV usually requires a combination of three or more medications. These combinations (called HAART) must be taken every day, can cause complications, and can be expensive.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9687" xml_f="10650" txt_i="3124" txt_f="4087">Worldwide, more than half a million children became infected with HIV each year. Most of these children acquire HIV from their mothers during pregnancy or around the time of birth. If a pregnant woman with HIV takes HAART, her chances of passing HIV to the baby are greatly reduced, but the possible side effects of HAART on the baby are not known. Also, most transmission of HIV from mothers to babies occurs in poor countries where supplies of HAART are limited. For these reasons, World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend that every pregnant woman receive HAART to prevent HIV transmission to the baby, unless the woman needs HAART for her own health (for example if her T cells are low or she has severe symptoms of HIV infection). For pregnant women with HIV who do not need to take HAART for their own health, less complicated treatments, involving a short course of one or two HIV drugs, can be used to reduce the risk of passing HIV to the baby.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title><offsets xml_i="10682" xml_f="10706" txt_i="4089" txt_f="4113">Why Was This Study Done?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10717" xml_f="11211" txt_i="4114" txt_f="4608">The WHO recommendations for HAART in pregnancy are based on the best available evidence, but it is important to know how well they work in actual practice. The authors of this study were providing HIV treatment to pregnant women with HIV in West Africa through an established clinic program in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, and wanted to see how well the WHO recommendations for HAART or short-course treatments, depending on the mother's condition, were working to protect babies from HIV infection.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title><offsets xml_i="11243" xml_f="11280" txt_i="4610" txt_f="4647">What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11291" xml_f="11784" txt_i="4648" txt_f="5141">The researchers studied 250 HIV-infected pregnant women who received HIV medications in the Abidjan program between mid-2003 and mid-2005. In accordance with WHO guidelines, 107 women began HAART for their own health during pregnancy, and 143 women did not qualify for HAART but received other short course treatments (scARV) to prevent HIV transmission to their babies.

Also, 7.5% of women on HAART developed side effects requiring a change in their medications. Combining the results from HAART and scART groups, the chance of HIV transmission around the time of birth was 2.2%, increasing to 5.7% at age 1 y. (Three-quarters of the infants were breast-fed; safe water for mixing formula was not reliably available.)

Unfortunately, because formula feeding was not generally available in resource-limited settings, protection declined over the first year of life with breast-feeding, but some protection remained.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13314" xml_f="13855" txt_i="6613" txt_f="7154">This study confirms that close monitoring of pregnant women on HAART is necessary, so that drugs can be changed if side effects develop. The study does not tell us whether using scARV in pregnancy might change the virus in ways that would make it more difficult to treat the same women with HAART later if they needed it. The reason for low birth weight in some babies born to mothers on HAART is unclear. It may be because the women who needed HAART had more severe health problems from their HIV, or it may be a result of the HAART itself.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title><offsets xml_i="13887" xml_f="13910" txt_i="7156" txt_f="7179">Additional Information.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="13921" xml_f="13993" txt_i="7180" txt_f="7252">Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040257"><offsets xml_i="14083" xml_f="14129" txt_i="7252" txt_f="7298">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040257</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="14140" xml_f="14141" txt_i="7298" txt_f="7299">.</offsets></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="14184" xml_f="14224" txt_i="7300" txt_f="7340">World Health Organization has a page on </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/hiv/mtct/en/index.html"><offsets xml_i="14309" xml_f="14358" txt_i="7340" txt_f="7389">prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="14369" xml_f="14370" txt_i="7389" txt_f="7390">
