The previous studies focused only on the onset time of action. However no investigation of duration of action or recovery profiles when rocuronium was administered as a priming drug followed by administration of cisatracurium has been reported. Therefore, the authors have conducted the current study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16517" xml_f="16671" txt_i="11293" txt_f="11447">As mentioned previously, combination with NMBDs which have different molecular structure can be more synergic than that with similar molecular structure [</offsets><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="16703" xml_f="16705" txt_i="11447" txt_f="11449">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16712" xml_f="16713" txt_i="11449" txt_f="11450">,</offsets><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="16745" xml_f="16747" txt_i="11450" txt_f="11452">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16754" xml_f="16906" txt_i="11452" txt_f="11604">].

Thus, we hypothesized that clinical duration will be prolonged in group 2 because of high affinity for the prejunctional nicotinic-acetylcholine receptor of rocuronium and recovery characteristics would also be affected by rocuronium. Actually, the mean recovery time/onset time ratios of the current study was approximately 16.3, 31.6, and 18.6 in group 1, group 2, and group 3, respectively. However, high recovery time/onset time ratio of group 2 was on account of shortening of onset time only; no significant differences in clinical duration and recovery time were observed among the groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17923" xml_f="18297" txt_i="12537" txt_f="12911">We proposed some hypothetical reasons for the similar results in clinical duration and recovery characteristics among the groups.

According to the result, priming with rocuronium showed more prejunctional effect than did cisatracurium, however, postjunctional effects of both drugs were equal. Second, the dose of priming solution was so small and just enough to affect onset of action. Breslin et al.

The dose of rocuronium used in our study was just the priming dose (0.06 mg/kg); thus, the effect of rocuronium would have waned into insignificance at the point of recovery.
