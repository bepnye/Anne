Stones in the distal ureter pass more readily than stones located more proximally. Consequently, patients with favourable features and with smaller sized stones in the lower ureter are initially treated conservatively. Immediate active intervention occurs in those patients with larger stones and unfavourable features who are deemed clinically to be unsuitable for conservative treatment. Those who fail standard conservative care or who subsequently develop complications also undergo later active treatment. This can be ESWL, preliminary ureteric stenting with later stone removal, ureteroscopy with stone retrieval or destruction (in situ lithotripsy) or percutaneous nephrostomy insertion and later stone removal. ESWL and ureteroscopic treatment require expensive equipment and urological expertise. Both have been shown to be options that are safe and effective in a number of studies. In clinical practice, urologists tend to favour ureteroscopy over ESWL particularly for mid and lower ureteric stones due to perceived higher rate of clinical stone clearance [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7"><offsets xml_i="17409" xml_f="17410" txt_i="6874" txt_f="6875">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17417" xml_f="17419" txt_i="6875" txt_f="6877">].</offsets></p><p id="Par43"><offsets xml_i="17437" xml_f="17474" txt_i="6878" txt_f="6915">A Cochrane systematic review (2007) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8"><offsets xml_i="17506" xml_f="17507" txt_i="6915" txt_f="6916">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17514" xml_f="19033" txt_i="6916" txt_f="8435">] comparing the effectiveness of ESWL with ureteroscopic management of ureteric stones identified seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving a total of 732 participants. The results of this review suggest stone-free rates were lower in the ESWL group (RR (relative risk) = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70–0.98); reflecting this retreatment, rates for ESWL were higher (RR = 2.78, 95% CI = 0.53–14.71) but these findings are associated with much uncertainty. Complications were less frequent after ESWL (RR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.21–0.92) and this option was associated with a shorter hospital stay (mean difference = 2.10 days, 95% CI = – 2.55 – – 1.64 days). The review concluded that ureteroscopic treatment of stones was associated with a higher stone free rate but a higher morbidity (complication rate) and a longer hospital stay. However, the overall quality of the studies was poor and inclusion criteria were strict in each study, limiting both the generalisability and applicability of the review findings. There was limited evidence on which to judge the comparative effectiveness in clinically important prognostic subgroups for example location of stones in the ureter. None of the studies reported on health-related quality of life and only one reported a cost-effectiveness outcome.

Pre-defined outcome measures were stone-free rate and number of additional procedures required. The results were stratified according to stone location in the ureter (proximal, mid, distal) and stone diameter (≤ 10 mm, &gt; 10 mm). All forms of ESWL were analysed as a single treatment modality in the meta-analysis. The Panel concluded that the main advantage of ureteroscopy is a higher stone-free rate with a single procedure, but with a higher complication rate. However, the evidence was insufficient for the Panel to recommend between ESWL and ureteroscopy and concluded that for patients requiring active stone removal, either treatment modality is acceptable as first-line options. For the individual patient, the choice is often determined by a number of factors including the availability of resources, preference of the treating urologist, and preference of the patient.

As standard practice, clinicians or delegated personnel will assess patients presenting with suspected ureteric calculi. A log will be taken of all patients assessed in order to document the reasons for non-inclusion in the study (e.g. reason they were ineligible or declined to participate) to inform the CONSORT diagram. Brief details of potentially eligible patients will be recorded in the screening logs at each site (these will be an aid to monitoring potential participant inclusion). Following adequate pain relief and confirmation of ureteric calculi by CTKUB, eligible patients (according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria) will be provided a patient information leaflet. The information leaflet will be given to each potential participant to inform them of the benefits and known drawbacks of all aspects of this trial. The PIL explains that the trial is investigating the use of either ESWL or ureteroscopic treatment as the first treatment option for symptomatic ureteric stones that require an active intervention. Each patient will have the opportunity to discuss the study with the local clinical team. Patients may make a decision to participate, during a consultation with the local clinical team during a visit to hospital (e.g. when they attend a clinic appointment or while a patient in hospital for their initial stone episode) or alternatively at home. If the patient agrees to be contacted at home, he/she may receive a telephone call from the local Research Nurse to discuss any queries. Signed informed consent forms will be obtained from the participants in all centres. Participants who cannot give informed consent (e.g. due to incapacity) will be not be eligible for participation. The participant’s permission will be sought to inform their general practitioner that they are taking part in this trial. Patients who decide to participate following telephone counselling can either send their completed documents (consent form and baseline questionnaire) through the post to the local team at their treating hospital or bring it with them if they are returning to hospital for another consultation or treatment. Participants will be randomised to one of the two treatment groups following consent, completion and receipt of baseline questionnaire.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title><offsets xml_i="27060" xml_f="27088" txt_i="15059" txt_f="15087">Randomisation and allocation</offsets></title><p id="Par68"><offsets xml_i="27110" xml_f="27544" txt_i="15088" txt_f="15522">Eligible and consenting participants will be randomised to one of the two intervention groups using the telephone Interactive Voice Response (IVR) randomisation application or via the web-based application - both hosted by the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT), Health Services Research Unit (HSRU) in Aberdeen, which is a fully registered, Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) with the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC).</offsets></p><p id="Par69"><offsets xml_i="27562" xml_f="27798" txt_i="15523" txt_f="15756">Randomisation will be minimised by centre, stone size (≤ 10 mm or &gt; 10 mm, as measured by the maximum stone diameter on CTKUB) and location of the stone in either the upper, mid or lower ureter (as defined in the EAU/AUA Guidelines).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title><offsets xml_i="27830" xml_f="27846" txt_i="15758" txt_f="15774">Trial procedures</offsets></title><p id="Par70"><offsets xml_i="27868" xml_f="28898" txt_i="15775" txt_f="16805">Participants will complete a total of five questionnaires.

The margin of inferiority deemed acceptable is 0.20 so that P2-P1 &gt; − 0.20. The sample size was estimated using simulations, designed for this purpose, run in Stata. The power of a non-inferiority trial can be considered as the probability that the lower bound of the estimated 95% CI around the difference between trial proportions excludes the margin of non-inferiority. Simulating 1000s of trials of fixed sizes with the parameters P1 and P2 as above indicates that a trial of 450 per arm is required for the lower bound of the estimated 95% CI to exclude − 20% with 90% power. Adjustment for potential 10% drop-out inflates the trial to 1000 in total.

The amendment has been ratified by the trial oversight committees and the sponsor and the funder. Recruitment projections showed us that the original sample size of 1000 was unachievable in a realistic timeframe despite measures implemented to improve recruitment. We agreed with the funder an extension of 18 months to reach a revised sample size of 750. Our original sample size of 1000 included a 15% uplift from 850 to perform the primary analysis under a suitably defined per-protocol analysis.

However, the view of the HTA Board, which has since been confirmed by the TISU independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC), is that the ITT approach should take primacy over this per-protocol approach, to better reflect that the purpose of this pragmatic effectiveness trial is to compare the policy of initiating one or other of these treatment options and not to focus on the actual comparative performance of the treatment options themselves. The per-protocol approach will still be used as a supporting analysis. This is also a rare context in which there is no missing outcome data, since we are sure that we will have identified any further interventions to facilitate stone clearance in the six months postoperatively; hence, we can say with certainty for each individual randomised whether the original operation cleared the stone.</offsets></p><p id="Par101"><offsets xml_i="40712" xml_f="41405" txt_i="26085" txt_f="26778">Based on the 267 participants with mature outcome data as of 16 February 2016, the iDMC observed that all the assumptions behind the power calculation remain plausible.

Clinical and cost-effectiveness is determined with respect to: (1) resolution of stone episode; (2) incremental cost per QALYs; (3) participant-reported health outcomes; and (4) disease or treatment-related harms up to six months post randomisation.</offsets></p><p id="Par111"><offsets xml_i="46626" xml_f="46678" txt_i="31465" txt_f="31517">The trial has been scored using the PRECIS-2 wheel [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12"><offsets xml_i="46711" xml_f="46713" txt_i="31517" txt_f="31519">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46720" xml_f="46732" txt_i="31519" txt_f="31531">] (see Fig. </offsets><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig"><offsets xml_i="46764" xml_f="46765" txt_i="31531" txt_f="31532">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46772" xml_f="46785" txt_i="31532" txt_f="31545">: Diagram 1).</offsets><fig id="Fig2"><label><offsets xml_i="46807" xml_f="46813" txt_i="31545" txt_f="31551">Fig. 2</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="46833" xml_f="46866" txt_i="31551" txt_f="31584">PRECIS-2 wheel for the TISU trial</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2652_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"></graphic></fig></p><p id="Par112"><offsets xml_i="46972" xml_f="48043" txt_i="31586" txt_f="32657">It is not possible to blind the TISU trial participants or clinicians to their allocated initial treatments or any further treatments. Lack of blinding may increase threats to the internal validity, such as systematic differences in withdrawal/follow-up, in care provided, in outcome observation, measurement and assessment. In the context of the TISU trial where we are evaluating the effectiveness of a care pathway that starts with concealed random allocation to the initial treatment for a symptomatic condition, we do not think lack of blinding is a major threat to internal validity. The primary outcome is ‘Further interventions to resolve the stone episode up to six months post randomisation’. The outcome is determined via CRF of interventions, collected and collated by research nurses at sites. Standard care guidelines guide treatment decisions and we would not expect clinicians to withhold further interventions judged necessary to facilitate resolution of the stone episode or to withhold treatments for complications over the six months after allocation.</offsets></p><p id="Par113"><offsets xml_i="48062" xml_f="48744" txt_i="32658" txt_f="33340">One of the main continuing challenges of the TISU trial is identification and recruitment of participants. The care pathway for ureteric stone patients can be complicated and many patients present to secondary care through Accident and Emergency departments, out of normal hours and are missed by research staff at site. To overcome this issue, many sites are running stone management clinics involving research staff to help identify participants. In other instances, the radiographer at the participating sites is providing researchers with a list of patients that have a single ureteric stone identified by CTKUB. This has helped to ensure that potential patients are not missed.</offsets></p><p id="Par114"><offsets xml_i="48763" xml_f="49237" txt_i="33341" txt_f="33815">In addition, feedback from screening logs, qualitative sub-study TISU Qual and discussions with sites have indicated that study recruitment has been affected by patients and clinicians having a preference for one treatment over the other. This is being investigated further to understand the reasons for these preferences and whether measures can be put in place to place them in equipoise when considering the study. The impact of this will be discussed in the full report.</offsets></p><p id="Par115"><offsets xml_i="49256" xml_f="50089" txt_i="33816" txt_f="34649">Our previous experience with this patient population has shown that response rates to participant questionnaires tend to be low (49% at 12-week questionnaire follow-up as demonstrated in the SUSPEND trial, August 2015). In anticipation of this, strategies to ensure a better response rate were implemented at the start of TISU. One of these approaches was to provide participants with the choice of how they would prefer to receive questionnaires either by post or via email. The response rate to study questionnaires at six months has always been low and we have observed a slow decrease in the rate. The current rate is 65% completion at six-month time-point. The overwhelming evidence from a recent review of strategies to improve retention in a clinical trial supports the use of monetary incentives in improving response rates [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13"><offsets xml_i="50122" xml_f="50124" txt_i="34649" txt_f="34651">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="50131" xml_f="50414" txt_i="34651" txt_f="34934">].
