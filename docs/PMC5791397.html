Other advantages include easy evacuation of the stone through the nephroscope (a limitation for TUCL with cystoscope); removal of stone fragments through the resectoscope sheath prevent possible inadvertent urethral injury during removal of large fragments; and a totally scar free surgery (so, cosmetically good and lesser morbidity in terms of hospital stay, visceral injury, and analgesic requirement) as compared to open surgery and PCCL.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24934" xml_f="25193" txt_i="16324" txt_f="16583">Author acknowledges the following limitations of the study.
