These studies showed increases in PA levels, but most showed no significant differences between intervention and control participants. One limitation of previous faith-based studies may have been limited attention to incorporating tenets of the faith-based organization (e.g., religious beliefs, scriptural references) into intervention strategies and limited involvement of the faith-based organization in intervention development. These factors may play an important role in determining intervention success, but additional research is needed to develop interventions that address these factors.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6517" xml_f="7056" txt_i="3248" txt_f="3787">The purpose of this study was to develop and test a faith-based PA program to increase participation in daily walking and moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity (MPA and VPA, respectively), particularly in bouts lasting 10 minutes or longer, among sedentary black adults.

In September and October 2004, nine local church pastors participated in in-depth interviews and provided input on the design, development, and implementation strategies for health promotion programs in churches in general and a faith-based PA program specifically.

Pastors indicated that they play a role in the health of their church congregants by setting an example for healthy living, imparting the knowledge that wholeness and health are essential parts of Christian character that enable one to do God's bidding and that the body is God's temple. They advocate, encourage, and support efforts to engage in healthy behaviors and to implement health-related programming within the church. Pastors provided suggestions for why their congregants were not physically active (e.g., lack of motivation, knowledge, time, or resources) as well as feedback on ways to successfully implement a faith-based intervention (e.g., getting buy-in and support from the pastor, making sure to offer sessions during times that do not conflict with other church activities, linking health-promoting activities to church ministries rather than creating separate programs).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8826" xml_f="9349" txt_i="5477" txt_f="6000">We used information from the in-depth interviews to shape the study design and session content of the faith-based PA intervention.

Sessions opened and closed with prayer, and session content was presented from a theological perspective with a focus on personal health care as a method of protecting God's temple. Session five focused entirely on healthful living and negotiating barriers from a Biblical perspective.

Incentive items were provided at each session to encourage PA participation. A certified fitness instructor conducted the 30-minute MPA session and provided an opportunity for participants to practice using incentive items.

These criteria were selected to avoid hiring highly trained individuals, which might hamper the ability to disseminate this type of intervention to a larger audience, and to avoid potential biases by hiring church members because all four churches could not be represented in group leadership.

The IPAQ assesses adherence to national recommendations for MPA and VPA during the previous 7 days. Two questions assess days per week and time per session for VPA or MPA lasting 10 minutes or more per session. Three questions assess daily and brisk walking at work, at home, for transportation, and for recreation, sport, exercise, or leisure for 10 minutes or more per session. To increase the accuracy of self-reported data, we modified the questions by changing open-ended questions related to frequency to closed-ended questions. Participants selected days per week from a list ranging from 0 days to 7 days. We also modified the questions on duration of PA from an open-ended response to categorical responses to try to reduce overestimation: "I do not do _____ activity for more than 10 minutes in a row"; "10 to 15 minutes"; "15 to 30 minutes"; "30 to 45 minutes"; "45 to 60 minutes"; and "Over 60 minutes." To calculate a continuous measure of PA participation, 0, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 were used to estimate minutes per day. We modified the question order from the original version of the IPAQ and asked about daily walking before asking about other MPA. We modified the timing to ask about usual PA instead of PA in the past 7 days. Minutes per week in MPA were calculated as the sum of days per week multiplied by minutes per day in MPA and brisk walking. Minutes per week in VPA were calculated as the sum of days per week multiplied by minutes per day in VPA.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21168" xml_f="21174" txt_i="17134" txt_f="17140">

Second, this study's sample group was small; additional participants may have improved our ability to detect differences in clinical variables. Third, we did not have objective data for participation in MPA and VPA. We attempted to collect these data using accelerometers but encountered several issues related to adherence to the accelerometer data collection protocol and, thus, were not able to use these data for analyses.

We addressed some limitations of previous studies by incorporating tenets of the church and by involving the church in intervention development.
