Analysis of primary outcomes was on an intention-to-treat basis. The income-generating projects proved impossible to implement in the prevailing economic climate. Despite greater programme activity and knowledge in the intervention communities, the incidence rate ratio of HIV-1 was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92–1.75) compared to the control communities. No evidence was found for reduced incidence of self-reported STI symptoms or high-risk sexual behaviour in the intervention communities. Males who attended programme meetings had lower HIV-1 incidence (incidence rate ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.24–0.98), and fewer men who attended programme meetings reported unprotected sex with casual partners (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.28–0.75).

However, this proportion has been declining slowly in recent years, and the same trend has also been seen in a few other African countries. It is not clear whether these trends are related to changes in the way people behave, perhaps as a result of public health and prevention campaigns, or rather are due to changes in the natural spread of the HIV epidemic. However, there is considerable uncertainty about how we should carry out campaigns that try to get people to change their behavior. One possible approach for achieving behavior change involves peer education: that is, education carried out within the community, by at-risk community members themselves. Another approach involves tying together a set of related programs that deliver information and education through health clinics and directly in the community. Such programs are termed “integrated community and clinic-based HIV prevention.”</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title><offsets xml_i="8767" xml_f="8791" txt_i="3139" txt_f="3163">Why Was This Study Done?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8802" xml_f="9212" txt_i="3164" txt_f="3574">The researchers wanted to find out whether providing integrated community and clinic-based strategies for HIV prevention in Eastern Zimbabwe could reduce the proportion of people within the community infected with HIV. If successful, then the strategies could be effective elsewhere, for example in other African countries where behavior patterns and the HIV epidemic are similar to the situation studied here.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title><offsets xml_i="9244" xml_f="9281" txt_i="3576" txt_f="3613">What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9292" xml_f="11079" txt_i="3614" txt_f="5401">The research was done as a cluster-randomized trial. This means that different communities were assigned by chance to one of two trial arms, either an “intervention arm”, where the community and clinic-based strategies would be delivered, or a “control” arm which would not have additional services. Six pairs of communities in Eastern Zimbabwe were compared, each of which had its own health center. Control communities received the standard government services for preventing HIV. The other communities received a package of various additional strategies. These included education and condom distribution amongst sex workers and their clients; better services at sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics (STIs can increase the risk of HIV infection); and educational HIV/AIDS open days at health centers. The researchers planned to compare, between the two arms, the number of people who became infected with HIV over the course of the trial. They found that there was no statistical difference in the number of people in the intervention arm who became infected with HIV over the course of the trial, as compared to people in the control arm. Men in the intervention communities were more likely to have effective treatment for STIs, but women were more likely to show risky behaviors, such as having sex at a younger age, and having unprotected sex. However, men in the intervention communities were more knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS than men in the control communities. One strategy in the intervention arm (delivery of education and condom distribution among sex workers and their clients) may have been less successful because of the economic situation at the time, which meant that the income-generating projects that were supposed to support this initiative were impossible.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title><offsets xml_i="11111" xml_f="11139" txt_i="5403" txt_f="5431">What Do These Findings Mean?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11150" xml_f="11875" txt_i="5432" txt_f="6157">Some of the results from this trial are encouraging, for example an improvement in male participants' knowledge and behavior. However, overall, the intervention did not have an impact on the HIV infection rate in the community. Some other trials have also shown similar results. These results mean that other strategies need to be developed, and tested, which will encourage people to change their behavior patterns and reduce the risk of getting HIV. However, trials such as this are very difficult to design, carry out, and interpret. In particular, if a complex intervention such as this fails, it is often hard to tell whether it did so because the intervention was not delivered successfully, or because it did not work.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title><offsets xml_i="11907" xml_f="11930" txt_i="6159" txt_f="6182">Additional Information.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11941" xml_f="12013" txt_i="6183" txt_f="6255">Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040102"><offsets xml_i="12103" xml_f="12149" txt_i="6255" txt_f="6301">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040102</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="12160" xml_f="12161" txt_i="6301" txt_f="6302">.</offsets></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="12204" xml_f="12266" txt_i="6303" txt_f="6365">Information from Avert, an international HIV/AIDS charity, on </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.avert.org/aids-zimbabwe.htm"><offsets xml_i="12348" xml_f="12372" txt_i="6365" txt_f="6389">HIV and AIDS in Zimbabwe</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="12383" xml_f="12384" txt_i="6389" txt_f="6390">

Structural obstacles to intervention implementation included HIV/AIDS mortality which disrupted the programme by claiming the lives of two programme coordinators and several of the nursing staff and peer-educators. Economic decline made the income-generating projects unfeasible and reduced the effectiveness of other components of the intervention. We believe that the coverage of the peer-education programme was satisfactory, given the focus on highly sexually active individuals. Meeting coverage could have been under-estimated in the survey since one-to-one discussions and activities at beer halls and other public places may not have been recognised as meetings by those present. However, the high level of spatial mobility limited the number of people who were reached at the required level of intensity and consistency, whilst national shortages of foreign currency restricted fuel and drug supplies, hampered attempts to extend community activities into the more remote rural areas, and disrupted the STI treatment programme in both the intervention and control communities.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49969" xml_f="50649" txt_i="36675" txt_f="37355">The intervention that we evaluated could have greater effect where an HIV-1 epidemic is younger, HIV-1 incidence is greater, local sexual networks are less diffuse, background STI control is weak, herpes simplex virus type 2 is less common, population mobility is lower, and/or the socio-economic climate is stable. We cannot rule out an effect of peer education in the urban intervention community since similar activities were implemented in the control community. Targeted peer education may work better in towns where bar-based sex work is more extensive.
