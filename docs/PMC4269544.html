Therefore, many drugs are often used in combination with the primary anesthetic in an attempt to decrease the hemodynamic pressor response associated with intubation while limiting patient risk. One drug commonly used in conjunction with a primary anesthetic is Fentanyl because it is cost-effective and brings many other advantages (</offsets><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7934" xml_f="7935" txt_i="3256" txt_f="3257">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7942" xml_f="8101" txt_i="3257" txt_f="3416">).

Currently, no single drug has been able to completely inhibit the stress response to laryngoscopy and intubation. However, combination drug therapy may be able to better blunt this response. To date, a few studies have evaluated the combination of fentanyl and NTG with respect to their affect on hemodynamic response (</offsets><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9360" xml_f="9362" txt_i="4397" txt_f="4399">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9369" xml_f="9371" txt_i="4399" txt_f="4401">, </offsets><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9405" xml_f="9407" txt_i="4401" txt_f="4403">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9414" xml_f="10172" txt_i="4403" txt_f="5161">). However, administration of NTG alone during pre-intubation may not be sufficient to completely mediate hemodynamic response due to the tendency of NTG to produce tachycardia5. Despite the efficacy demonstrated in previous studies, in-depth analysis and ideal dose combination of fentanyl and NTG required to suppress the hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation has not yet been determined. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether a single 2 µg/kg bolus pre-induction injection of fentanyl administered 5 minutes prior to intubation and two puffs of NTG sub lingual spray (400 µg/spray) two minutes prior to intubation will significantly attenuate the hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation in normotensive patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title><offsets xml_i="10206" xml_f="10230" txt_i="5163" txt_f="5187">2.

However, the use of fentanyl alone was not sufficient to completely suppress hemodynamic pressor changes. NTG was chosen to be used in conjunction with fentanyl due to its ability to slowly decrease blood pressure and low dosage requirements. The mechanism of action for opioids like fentanyl includes the activation of the nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway. Consequently, the introduction of an additional NO source might increase effectiveness (</offsets><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="25704" xml_f="25706" txt_i="19049" txt_f="19051">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25713" xml_f="25887" txt_i="19051" txt_f="19225">).

However, for most of the measured hemodynamic parameters in our study, we concluded that the attenuation observed using the fentanyl-NTG combination was at best comparable to if not less effective than the use of fentanyl alone. We also observed some hemodynamic instability. At all time intervals T-3 through T-15 when HR was measured and some time intervals for DBP, MAP and RPP, the values for the experimental fentanyl-NTG group were higher than those of the control fentanyl only group. This suggests that the use of NTG in conjunction with fentanyl actually reduced the overall suppressive effectiveness of fentanyl on these hemodynamic parameters at specific time intervals. However, there were time intervals for SBP and MAP where the values for the fentanyl-NTG group were lower than the fentanyl only group and in some cases dropped significantly below the basal level. This suggests that the use of NTG in conjunction with fentanyl increased the overall suppressive effectiveness of fentanyl on SBP and MAP at specific time intervals. The variations in hemodynamic pressure responses to endotracheal intubation that were observed during this study for certain hemodynamic parameters at certain time intervals could be due to antagonistic drug interaction, overlapping duration of action, or experimental error or bias. There were also some time intervals for SBP, DBP, MAP and RPP where the hemodynamic values for the control and experimental groups were statistically equivalent, indicating that in those cases NTG neither increased nor decreased the effectiveness of fentanyl to reduce hemodynamic pressor response.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27702" xml_f="28004" txt_i="21028" txt_f="21330">Other studies have also reached conclusions that were similar to our study's findings when attempting to use fentanyl and NTG to attenuate hemodynamic pressor responses.

There clearly remains a lot of potential for the use fentanyl and NTG in improving anesthesia. When administered through the proper dosage, anesthesia method and combination of drugs, fentanyl and NTG could be used to acquire better hemodynamic results than the ones obtained in our study. There were no statistical demographic differences observed with respect to number of patients in each group (n=40), age or weight, although both the study and control groups had a disproportionate gender distribution.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST: NONE DECLARED.</bold></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kayhan</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Aldemir</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mutlu</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Öğűşş</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title></article-title><source>Eur J Anaesthesiol</source><year>2005</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>708</fpage><lpage>15</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Prys-Roberts</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Greene</surname><given-names>LT</given-names></name><name><surname>Meloche</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Foëx</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Studies of anaesthesia in relation to hypertension.
