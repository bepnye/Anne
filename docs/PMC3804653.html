We routinely perform clipping surgery via a pterional approach, for which the head is positioned depending on the location of aneurysm. The shoulder on the operated side is elevated and the head is rotated approximately 30 degrees toward the opposite side and then extended 20 degrees. In addition, we often change the operating chair, table, head rest and microscope during the surgery to achieve an appropriate surgical field. The size, location or pathology of aneurysms are useful in describing the aneurysms, but less useful in performing a preoperative work-up such as decision on the direction of sylvian fissure dissection during clipping surgery in MCA bifurcation aneurysms.

We suggest that M1 exposure is a crucial procedure during aneurysm clipping, for which the direction of sylvian fissure dissection is an important step. It is important to identify whether there are parallel relationships between microscopic view angle and direction of M1 vessel or not. In other words, the lower the M1 angle and the smaller the M1 slope gap, the more parallel relationships between microscopic view angle and direction of M1 vessel, making it difficult to identify the M1 vessel through distal to proximal sylvian fissure dissection method. In those situations, we prefer the proximal to distal sylvian fissure dissection method. The high M1 angle and big M1 slope gap mean that the M1 exposure area is wide in the microscopic view so we can identify the M1 vessel easily, resulting in ease to perform M1 proximal control through distal to proximal sylvian fissure dissection method. Therefore, we measured angle relationships by using 3D-CTA. According to our study, the M1 slope gap was 1.00 ± 0.42 mm and the mean of M1 angle was 9.36 ± 3.73°, indicating difficult to identify M1 vessels through distal to proximal sylvian fissure dissection method. So if the M1 slope gap is less than 1.42 mm or the M1 angle is less than 13.09°, proximal to distal sylvian fissure dissection is preferable. For example, when the M1 slope gap was 1.31 mm and M1 angle was 10.2° in preoperative 3D-CTA, we would better using a proximal to distal sylvian fissure dissection for ease of M1 exposure.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17934" xml_f="18091" txt_i="12357" txt_f="12514">Patients with ruptured aneurysms are at increased risk of developing premature rupture.

Particularly, in acute surgery, the anatomical situation around the aneurysm can be difficult due to bleeding and adhesions within the cistern. Moreover, when there is antero-superior projection of the MCA bifurcation aneurysms, the dome may adhere to the arachnoid membrane covering the sylvian fissure. This raises the risk of developing premature rupture during dissection and exposure.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="19103" xml_f="19105" txt_i="13419" txt_f="13421">4)</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19112" xml_f="19390" txt_i="13421" txt_f="13699"> Otherwise, it would also be necessary to puncture and empty the aneurysm, essential for completely separating the efferent branches and stimulating them.

This suggests that surgical approaches for the direction of sylvian fissure dissection should be determined based on surgeons' preference and experience. We measured the M1 angles and M1 slope gap on a 3D-CTA. This may lead to a safer operation by making proximal control easier in the event of premature rupture. Therefore, we used a preoperative 3D-CTA to identify the LS line, ICA bifurcation, MCA bifurcation and M1 angles. Thus, we could decide on the direction of sylvian fissure dissection for the proximal control of M1 in cases of MCA bifurcation aneurysm through 3D-CTA.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20354" xml_f="20638" txt_i="14535" txt_f="14819">In conclusion, proximal control of M1 using a temporary clip is a key procedure during aneurysmal neck clipping for preventing premature rupture of aneurysm.

First, we classified our clinical series of patients into the groups depending on the technical level of ease of M1 exposure solely based on our subjective judgment. Second, we did not consider several factors for easy surgical dissection trajectory for proximal control of M1. For example, the length of M1 influences direction of the sylvian fissure dissection. If M1 is short, it is too difficult to dissect distal to proximal direction due to aneurysm's deep location. In addition, if the aneurysm is large, regardless of the direction of M1, M1 proximal control is difficult. Also, the M1 can be covered by a large aneurysm. Therefore, these factors should be considered. Finally, further prospective studies are necessary. Because this study was a retrospective study of a small series, clinical application for large series is required.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="21578" xml_f="21588" txt_i="15710" txt_f="15720">CONCLUSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21599" xml_f="22252" txt_i="15721" txt_f="16374">The direction of M1 vessel is an important factor for M1 exposure during MCA bifurcation aneurysm surgery, and the direction of M1 vessel depends on the M1 angles and the M1 slope gap. They should be confirmed on a 3D-CTA preoperatively. We suggest that our results are useful in identification of M1 vessel for proximal control during surgical clipping, especially when the possibility of premature rupture is high in sylvian fissure dissection. So if the M1 slope gap is less than 1.42 mm or the M1 angle is less than 13.09°, proximal to distal sylvian fissure dissection is preferable to distal to proximal sylvian fissure dissection for M1 exposure.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
