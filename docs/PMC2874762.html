At present, 60 to 70% of the women with a fetes in breech position undergoes ECV in the Netherlands.

To correct for the degree of similarity among responses within a cluster, a intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.10 was integrated in the power analyses. To be able to show the difference of 30% with a power of 80% and an alpha error of 5%, we need 20 clusters of a 30 patients each.
