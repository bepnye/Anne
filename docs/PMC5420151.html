The literature has noted the need to introduce interventions during this period, particularly for adolescent girls, with the perspective that such investments have significant economic, social and health returns to society. The Adolescent Girls Empowerment Programme (AGEP) was an intervention designed as a catalyst for change for adolescent girls through themselves, to their family and community. </offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6282" xml_f="6296" txt_i="592" txt_f="606">Methods/design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6307" xml_f="7810" txt_i="607" txt_f="2110">AGEP was a multi-sectoral intervention targeting over 10,000 vulnerable adolescent girls ages 10–19 in rural and urban areas, in four of the ten provinces of Zambia. At the core of AGEP were mentor-led, weekly girls’ group meetings of 20 to 30 adolescent girls participating over two years. Three curricula ― sexual and reproductive health and lifeskills, financial literacy, and nutrition ― guided the meetings. An engaging and participatory pedagogical approach was used. Two additional program components, a health voucher and a bank account, were offered to some girls to provide direct mechanisms to improve access to health and financial services. Embedded within AGEP was a rigorous multi-arm randomised cluster trial with randomization to different combinations of programme arms. The study was powered to assess the impact across a set of key longer-term outcomes, including early marriage and first birth, contraceptive use, educational attainment and acquisition of HIV and HSV-2. Baseline behavioural surveys and biological specimen collection were initiated in 2013. Impact was evaluated immediately after the program ended in 2015 and will be evaluated again after two additional years of follow-up in 2017. The primary analysis is intent-to-treat. Qualitative data are being collected in 2013, 2015 and 2017 to inform the programme implementation and the quantitative findings. An economic evaluation will evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of each component of the intervention.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7832" xml_f="7842" txt_i="2112" txt_f="2122">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7853" xml_f="8180" txt_i="2123" txt_f="2450">The AGEP program and embedded evaluation will provide detailed information regarding interventions for adolescent girls in developing country settings.

The programme was designed as a multi-sectoral intervention targeted to vulnerable, rural and urban adolescent girls ages 10–19. Embedded in the design of the programme was a rigorous, randomized evaluation that recruited a cohort of eligible adolescent girls invited to participate in the programme and girls residing in control areas. The evaluation sample was interviewed at baseline in late 2013 and early 2014 and is being tracked annually through 2017, with mid-term results collected in 2015 immediately after the end of the intervention and endline results in 2017, two years post programme termination [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1"><offsets xml_i="10432" xml_f="10433" txt_i="3489" txt_f="3490">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10440" xml_f="10442" txt_i="3490" txt_f="3492">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10449" xml_f="10596" txt_i="3493" txt_f="3640">Adolescent girls in less developed countries face a variety of risks and challenges in achieving positive and successful transitions to adulthood [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2"><offsets xml_i="10628" xml_f="10629" txt_i="3640" txt_f="3641">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10636" xml_f="10969" txt_i="3641" txt_f="3974">]. In Zambia, a significant proportion of girls enter marriage and/or begin childbearing early, even prior to the expected age of school leaving.

The Zambia DHS also indicates that girls in Zambia begin sexual activity early, have low rates of condom use and have risk behaviours that increase their chances of acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. For instance, the median age of sexual debut is 17.7 years, approximately 1 year prior to marriage, and the prevalence of sexual initiation among 15–19 year olds is 27%. Further, of those who are currently engaging in premarital sexual activity, only 36% reported using a condom at last sex. The low rate of consistent condom use implies exposure to STIs, with 4% of adolescents 15–19 reporting having an STI or symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease and 5% having acquired HIV. The prevalence of HIV more than doubles by the time girls reach the ages of 20–24 years [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1"><offsets xml_i="12321" xml_f="12322" txt_i="5177" txt_f="5178">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12329" xml_f="12331" txt_i="5178" txt_f="5180">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12338" xml_f="12813" txt_i="5181" txt_f="5656">The literature indicates that women and adolescent girls in many less developed settings are lacking the needed assets and capacities required to make more positive and healthier transitions that would facilitate their breaking out of persistent poverty and closing the economic and livelihoods gap between men and women.

The core component of AGEP was group meetings in which 20 to 30 girls met at a local community space for one to two hours per week, most often on weekends.

Reimbursements were a function of the total number of girls with vouchers obtaining services and the number of services that they accessed during the period that the vouchers were usable.

The study provinces and the number of sites per province were selected purposefully through discussions with the donor regarding representation of the target population and consideration of the feasibility of operating AGEP while also conducting a randomized evaluation. Study sites within provinces were selected randomly from a sampling frame of potential sites, anchored to proximally-located health and banking facilities. The sampling frames of potential sites for urban and rural areas were developed separately. For urban areas, a list of high-density residential compounds was created, and sites selected randomly from the list, while in rural areas sites were randomly selected among areas that met the following conditions: that they were located within 15 km from a health facility and within 65 km of a NatSave bank branch.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30542" xml_f="32025" txt_i="20829" txt_f="22312">AGEP was also designed to draw participants who expressed multiple levels of vulnerability through their residential location and the socio-economic characteristics of their households. To avoid over-representing girls in AGEP who have already experienced the outcomes that were to be prevented by the programme (early marriage, becoming pregnant, dropping out of school), these indicators were not directly used to identify vulnerability. Instead, an indicator of vulnerability was created using whether girls were behind in school for their age as a proxy, which also permits characterization of the vulnerability of girls younger than those who already have been married, pregnant or dropped out of school. Conceptually, the measure captures adolescents who are at risk of adverse outcomes, given the primacy of education in a child’s life at these ages. Early in the school-going process, many children fall behind in school due to late entry, repetition of grades, and temporary withdrawal from school; all of these events are a reflection of some degree of personal and household vulnerability. The information used to develop the measure of vulnerability was collected along with other household socio-economic characteristics via a household survey in all study clusters, which was subsequently used as a sampling frame to determine eligible girls for participation in the programme with the most vulnerable girls selected from the list to receive invitations to participate.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title><offsets xml_i="32057" xml_f="32086" txt_i="22314" txt_f="22343">Evaluation methods and design</offsets></title><p></p><sec id="Sec8"><title><offsets xml_i="32123" xml_f="32148" txt_i="22345" txt_f="22370">Randomised cluster design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32159" xml_f="32410" txt_i="22371" txt_f="22622">The AGEP evaluation was designed as a multi-arm randomised cluster trial where clusters within the ten study sites were randomised to receive different combinations (arms) of AGEP.

CSAs contained approximately 750 households in urban areas and 300 households in rural areas, although the average number of households varies considerably as population densities vary geographically. CSAs in urban areas were spatially relatively small, perhaps a few hundred metres long and wide, while CSAs in rural areas encompassed multiple kilometres. The assignment of CSAs to the experimental and control arms was conducted through a random selection process at a public lottery. The public lottery was conducted to maximize the transparency and community acceptance of AGEP. Local political and community leaders were invited to participate in the lottery, conducted at a centrally-located public facility. The lottery was conducted via a two-step selection process in which a CSA was first randomly selected for participation among all CSAs in the site and then an AGEP arm assigned through a second random selection process.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title><offsets xml_i="34991" xml_f="35005" txt_i="24849" txt_f="24863">Study outcomes</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="35016" xml_f="35861" txt_i="24864" txt_f="25709">The overall objective of AGEP was to make a meaningful change in the traditionally observed trajectories of vulnerable adolescent girls in Zambia as they pertained to early family formation, low schooling attainment and poor sexual and reproductive health.

The weekly girls’ group meeting is hypothesized, in particular, to have positive effects on the girls’ sexual and reproductive health, financial and nutritional knowledge, as well as build their communications, money management and self-advocacy skills. The group meetings also targeted the girls’ social assets, including the number of friends reported, the quality of those relationships and whether they report a role model in their lives. Participation in the groups is also hypothesized to reduce social isolation and provide access to community spaces. These relationships and opportunities are, in-turn, hypothesized to weaken regressive gender norms and roles, move aspirations, and improve mediating behaviours, such as attending school. In the domain of schooling attainment, these changes are hypothesized to improve school participation, performance and, ultimately, attainment. If confirmed, these hypothesizes will result in strong and positive relationships between the indicator of randomization to the girls group only study arm and the indicators noted along this continuum of outcomes.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title><offsets xml_i="41909" xml_f="41923" txt_i="30731" txt_f="30745">Health voucher</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="41934" xml_f="42936" txt_i="30746" txt_f="31748">As with the bank account component, the health voucher intervention is hypothesized to directly increase access to health facilities and resources, as well as to increase efficacy and decision-making control over the utilization of health facilities and resources. The effect of the heath voucher component is expected to be distinguishable empirically over and above what is realized through the weekly girls groups alone. In the immediate term, the health voucher is hypothesized to increase the use of sexual and reproductive health services, including the use of modern contraception. Improved sexual and reproductive health, e.g., by obtaining counselling, care and treatment for STIs, is hypothesized to reduce HIV acquisition in the longer-term, while access to contraception is hypothesized to reduce unwanted pregnancy and birth outcomes.

While the lessons themselves are hypothesized to directly increase knowledge and improve financial and entrepreneurial aspirations, the bank account component of AGEP was designed to provide a direct link and access to financial services to catalyse change. It is hypothesized, therefore, that the provision of a bank account will have positive impact on informal and formal savings behaviour. Increased access and control over economic resources is hypothesized to reduce the need for adolescent girls to rely on household resources from which they have less control to obtain personal items such as clothing and hygiene products, schooling supplies and/or pay school fees. Access to bank accounts is also hypothesized to depress the need for adolescent girls to rely on older and potentially riskier partners and exchange-based sexual relationships. These changes are hypothesized to reduce the prevalence of sexual exchange and, ultimately, reduce girls’ acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and HSV-2.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title><offsets xml_i="44263" xml_f="44299" txt_i="32957" txt_f="32993">Research population and sample sizes</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44310" xml_f="44972" txt_i="32994" txt_f="33656">Participants for the research study were randomly selected among all invited AGEP participants who were never married at baseline, stratified by site and age group.

With ACASI the respondent listened with headphones to pre-recorded questions and response categories, while, if desired and if the participant was literate, simultaneously reading the question on the device screen.

Important as well, analysis will be conducted to understand the underlying processes by which change occurred in the key areas of interest.

The average treatment effect of the programme on the adolescents in clusters randomised to AGEP relative to girls in clusters randomised to the control will be empirically assessed. The analysis will estimate models that are both unadjusted and adjusted for baseline covariates; both approaches accounting for strata and intraclass correlations within clusters. To accommodate for any baseline differences between AGEP and control clusters that may exist in the outcomes, a difference-in-differences (DID) calculation will be made for each indicator.

Therefore a secondary analysis will be conducted that uses a measure of participation intensity as the indicator of impact rather than the study’s random assignment. It is important to recognize the statistical estimation problems that arise from self-selection into AGEP, and the degree of participation in it, with the characteristics of girls predicting both their uptake of and exposure to the programme and key outcomes and behaviours of interest. A two-stage instrumental variables estimation approach will be used in which the first stage will predict programme participation, using the exogenous randomised assignment as the key instrumental variable, observed baseline covariates will also be included. The second stage will then use the predicted participation intensity from the first stage along with baseline covariates to test the relevant hypotheses. Appropriate tests, including F-tests on excluded instruments, the Wald F-statistic, and the Hansen statistic for over-identification will quantitatively assess the credibility of the selected instrumental variable.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title><offsets xml_i="58901" xml_f="58911" txt_i="45981" txt_f="45991">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="58922" xml_f="59517" txt_i="45992" txt_f="46587">AGEP was an intervention whose objective was to improve important adolescent transitions of girls in Zambia, with the expectation that improved outcomes for girls would lead to life-long improvements in the well-being of women and their children.

The AGEP programme is unique in the amount of investment in this effort, with over two years of weekly programme activities devoted to girls’ empowerment across a range of domains, including sexual and reproductive health, financial literacy, life skills and nutrition. AGEP was not, however, limited to the weekly girls groups, as two additional components, a bank account and health voucher, enhanced the potential impact of the group learnings by providing girls direct access to resources that typically did not exist for them or have high barriers to use. The multi-arm randomized evaluation was designed to assess whether each of these programme components provided additional value added in terms of impact.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="61076" xml_f="61970" txt_i="48054" txt_f="48948">Determining the impact of AGEP is important in order to provide needed evidence for governments, donors, and other stakeholders to develop policies and programs for adolescent girls. Delineating costs of the programme and the investment needed for added programme components can provide additional critical information about the investment needed to scale the programme and the incremental costs of investments in each intervention component. To achieve this additional aim, the study research protocol included an embedded economic evaluation that collected programme implementation and participant costs. The economic evaluation will provide cost-effectiveness information for each study arm and an opportunity to compare AGEP with alternative programmes that address the needs of adolescent girls in the areas of early marriage and childbearing, education and sexual and reproductive health.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional file</title><p>
