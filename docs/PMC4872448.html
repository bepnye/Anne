Although cytokines increased equally in all females, the correlations between cytokines and depressed mood were significantly stronger in females with sleep disturbance. Among males, no moderating effect of sleep disturbance was observed. Inflammation-induced depressed mood was considerably more severe among females reporting mild sleep disturbance compared with those reporting no sleep disturbance, suggesting that even mild sleep disturbance may increase vulnerability for inflammation-induced depression in females. Furthermore, sleep disturbance appears to increase the vulnerability to depression by augmenting affective sensitivity to cytokines rather than by enhancing cytokine responses to inflammatory challenge in females.</offsets></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6524" xml_f="6536" txt_i="1947" txt_f="1959">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6547" xml_f="6707" txt_i="1960" txt_f="2120">Depression is a major public health burden because it is highly prevalent—the lifetime prevalence of major depression is almost 20% in the US general population</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"><offsets xml_i="6745" xml_f="6746" txt_i="2120" txt_f="2121">1</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="6759" xml_f="6815" txt_i="2121" txt_f="2177">—and represents a leading cause of disability worldwide.</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"><offsets xml_i="6853" xml_f="6854" txt_i="2177" txt_f="2178">2</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="6867" xml_f="6954" txt_i="2178" txt_f="2265"> Indeed, depression is projected to become the leading cause of disease burden by 2030.</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3"><offsets xml_i="6992" xml_f="6993" txt_i="2265" txt_f="2266">3</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="7006" xml_f="7353" txt_i="2266" txt_f="2613"> Thus, models for understanding and treating depression are critical.

Indeed, stronger correlations between cytokine levels and depressed mood were found in females with sleep disturbance as compared with females without sleep disturbance. The mechanisms whereby sleep disturbance primes affective sensitivity to proinflammatory cytokines have yet to be elucidated.

Second, a related concern would be the possibility that depressed mood in this experimental study could have been majorly influenced by physical sickness symptoms, although in clinical practice depressed individuals experience both emotional and somatic symptoms of depression in varying degrees. To minimize this possibility, we used a depression scale that only assesses emotional symptoms such as ‘unhappy', ‘sad' and ‘hopeless'. Furthermore, both the main effect of endotoxin on depressed mood (reported elsewhere</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"><offsets xml_i="37224" xml_f="37226" txt_i="27507" txt_f="27509">21</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="37239" xml_f="37460" txt_i="27509" txt_f="27730">) and the moderation of depressed mood by sleep disturbance were independent from physical sickness symptoms; and the effects of endotoxin on physical sickness symptoms were not moderated by either sex (reported elsewhere</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"><offsets xml_i="37499" xml_f="37501" txt_i="27730" txt_f="27732">21</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="37514" xml_f="38732" txt_i="27732" txt_f="28950">) or sleep disturbance. Third, although this was a relatively large experimental study, owing to the analyses using subgroups by gender and sleep disturbance, each subgroup was small and some of the nonsignificant findings could be due to low power. However, it should be noted that, despite this potential problem of power, the present study revealed some notable significant findings. Fourth, the assessment of sleep disturbance relied on self-report, whereas polysomnography is arguably the objective standard to assess insomnia. However, assessment of sleep problems in clinical practice primarily relies on patients' subjective evaluation. Fifth, although this was a highly controlled experimental study, the main variable of interest, sleep disturbance, was an observed variable and not a randomly assigned experimental variable, hence limiting causal inferences from the current findings. To remedy this limitation as much as possible, all analyses were adjusted for potential confounders such as age, race, body mass index and baseline depressive symptoms. Sixth, menstrual cycle data were not collected and thus we could not examine whether menstrual cycle was associated with changes in mood or inflammation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38739" xml_f="39609" txt_i="28951" txt_f="29821">In summary, inflammation-induced depressed mood was considerably more severe among healthy females reporting mild sleep disturbance compared with those reporting no sleep disturbance, suggesting that even mild sleep disturbance may increase the vulnerability for inflammation-induced depression in females. Furthermore, sleep disturbance appears to increase the vulnerability to depression by augmenting affective sensitivity to proinflammatory cytokines rather than by enhancing cytokine responses to an inflammatory challenge in females. Of note, these moderating effects of sleep disturbance were not observed in males. The current findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the association between sleep disturbance and depression, and, if corroborated by future translational studies, may have important clinical implications for depression prevention.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was funded by an R01 from the National Institute of Mental Health to NIE (5R01MH091352).
