Symptom scores ranged from 0 (all symptoms absent) to 24 (all symptoms severe).

Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted to examine time to symptom resolution and PCR positivity at day 3–4 postrandomization. Symptom resolution was defined as occurring at the start of the first 24-hour period in which the total symptom score was ≤2 with no symptom rated higher than mild (symptom score of ≤1). The definition of symptom resolution was modified slightly, before analysis, from the original protocol, which did not consider the total symptom score.

intervention for both seasonal and pandemic infections. In this study, late treatment with oseltamivir did not reduce duration or severity of symptoms or RT-PCR-positive results on day 3–4. However, this study was underpowered due to unexpected circumstances. A clinical trial in Bangladesh, enrolling mostly children, found that oseltamivir treatment initiated ≥48 hours significantly decreased symptom duration, although the median days of illness was the same between the placebo/oseltamivir groups unless restricted to those persons treated on day 3 since illness onset (median 4 days for placebo and 3 days of oseltamivir). In addition, they showed that virus detection and isolation were significantly lower in the oseltamivir group on days 2 and 4 [</offsets><xref rid="OFV100C10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="20289" xml_f="20291" txt_i="12102" txt_f="12104">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20298" xml_f="20459" txt_i="12104" txt_f="12265">].
