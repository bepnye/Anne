participants in each group. Qualitative analysis of the focus group discussion transcripts revealed several common themes. Teachers reported that one of the best features of PAAC lessons are that they provide a "great teaching strategy" that helps break up the monotony of the class. Although many teachers voiced concerns at the beginning of the study about the possibility of students getting wild and out of control, teachers stated that just the opposite occurred with PAAC; it helped with behavior management, stopped the fidgeting, and made the students more alert and focused.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46001" xml_f="46464" txt_i="31372" txt_f="31835">When asked about the worst features of PAAC, teachers indicated that they need more time to incorporate physical activity into their lesson plans, chiefly because of new requirements set forth by the No Child Left Behind Act, which holds schools accountable for academic achievement. Many teachers also specified the need to develop more lessons for students in fourth and fifth grade, stating that their students perceived the examples provided as too "babyish".</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46471" xml_f="47233" txt_i="31836" txt_f="32598">When asked about challenges and barriers to achieving 90 minutes of active lessons per week, many teachers expressed the need for lessons that could be taught within a small classroom, indicating that the current examples were designed for larger classrooms without space constraints. In addition, teachers wanted more lesson demonstrations by research assistants to gain additional ideas about how to incorporate physical activity into a regular lesson. Similarly, several teachers wanted a forum to share and learn about creative lessons that worked well in other classrooms. Several suggestions included having teachers share lessons at school staff meetings, including examples in a newsletter, or placing creative lessons developed by teachers on a website.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47240" xml_f="48491" txt_i="32599" txt_f="33850">When we solicited information about potential benefits, both physically and academically, to students and teachers who actively participated in PAAC teachers indicated that active lessons encouraged them to be more creative, and helped students learn concepts better and improved their memorization skills. For example, one teacher stated, "it really helped my students remember things, especially spelling. Those who didn't do a PAAC activity with spelling did not do as well." With regards to physical improvements, some teachers expressed that they exercise now more than they ever have because they model the lessons with their students. Moreover, many teachers reported that the active lessons are the only physical activity the students get during most days because they stand around during recess talking with their friends, and physical education classes have been reduced to twice per week. As one teacher stated about active lessons, "This is the most I've seen some of these kids actually physically move." Others expressed that they did not think it made a difference in their bodies physically but PAAC changed their thinking about the necessity of movement within the classroom to help their students learn and retain information better.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="48513" xml_f="48530" txt_i="33852" txt_f="33869">Principal surveys</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48541" xml_f="48973" txt_i="33870" txt_f="34302">Principals from both intervention (n = 14) and control schools (n = 10) completed surveys (22 out of 26 principals; 85% response rate although all schools were represented because some schools have divided their school population into separate buildings.

For one intervention school, a principal indicated that they were increasing physical activity levels by having their students prepare for the Jump Rope for Heart program, which is an American Heart Association program. Two control school principals indicated that they were increasing physical activity levels by sending home summer learning packets, which have a fitness component, and organizing active games during recess. Programs that might have increased the quality of nutrition were not installed during the school year by either intervention or control schools. Principals specified that students from both intervention and control schools were not allowed to bring soda pop in their school lunches. In summary, there were minimal competing factors or activities reported by any of the elementary school principals during year one of the study.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="50231" xml_f="50241" txt_i="35496" txt_f="35506">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="50252" xml_f="50695" txt_i="35507" txt_f="35950">Year 1 process evaluation results suggest that the PAAC program was well accepted by intervention teachers as well as students.

Quantitative data regarding minutes of physical activity and number of lessons taught were collected weekly, which helped to determine if teachers were meeting the minimum prescription for the intervention. Weekly reporting also identified struggling teachers without delay. In this manner, assistance could be provided before excessive time elapsed. Data were also collected to help determine challenges teachers faced implementing the intervention, allowing study personnel to help minimize barriers to increasing physical activity within their curriculum. Areas of help provided by PAAC staff included lesson development, time management (e.g., determined how to include PAAC lessons within the framework of their lesson plans) and classroom management (e.g., providing cool down tips in order to help keep students focused after a physically active lesson). Through information gained by focus group discussions, we were able to modify the protocol to address implementation issues conveyed by teachers. For example, for the new academic year, teachers were supplied with several examples of lessons for fourth and fifth grade students designed to be more age appropriate. In addition, we solicited from teachers a number of creative lessons that students found enjoyable and were easily implemented. These particular lessons were placed on the PAAC website, allowing other teachers to gain examples of successful lessons.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="54856" xml_f="55426" txt_i="39867" txt_f="40437">Another strength of the evaluation was the collection of key process variables in both intervention and control schools. Although research staff costs, the burden of collecting and managing large amounts of data, and the complexity of school schedules were important considerations, tracking key process variables (i.e., physical activity levels, student enjoyment, and possible contamination factors) in both intervention and control schools provided essential information on fidelity, program context, and possible threats to the internal validity of the PAAC program.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="55448" xml_f="55459" txt_i="40439" txt_f="40450">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="55470" xml_f="56213" txt_i="40451" txt_f="41194">One of the limitations of the process evaluation data was that it relied upon teachers to self-report weekly data on how much and into what particular subjects was physical activity incorporated into lessons. Although the majority of teachers reported information in a timely manner, several teachers delayed reporting until being reminded by program staff, which could have potentially introduced recall bias. Another limitation was the low response rate for the end-of-year surveys. To ensure a greater response for the next school year, we have planned to administer the survey a week earlier to teachers so it does not interfere with end-of-school year activities and to reduce respondent burden during this particularly busy time of year.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="56235" xml_f="56256" txt_i="41196" txt_f="41217">Practice implications</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="56267" xml_f="56846" txt_i="41218" txt_f="41797">One of the goals of the PAAC project was to develop a minimal intervention that increased physical activity during school without reducing time allocated for classroom instruction, given the pressure to meet the No Child Left Behind Act's accountability provisions, in which schools must close the achievement gap, making sure all students achieve academic proficiency, Results from the process evaluation demonstrated that it is possible to incorporate physical activity within the curriculum by modifying existing academic lessons, thereby not competing for instructional time.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="56853" xml_f="57462" txt_i="41798" txt_f="42407">One of the major advantages of the PAAC project is that it is a minimal intervention that can be easily disseminated, requiring no change to the current curriculum, few additional supplies (if any) and minimal cost to schools. Some of the reasons for the success of PAAC during Year 1 can be attributed to the training provided to teachers and both the teachers' and students' positive responses to the physically active lessons. Further, teachers were given much flexibility and choice on how to integrate the intervention within their classroom (e.g., in what academic subjects, and how many times per day).</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="57490" xml_f="57511" txt_i="42410" txt_f="42431">List of abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="57522" xml_f="57760" txt_i="42432" txt_f="42670">PAAC: Physical activity across the curriculum; ILSI CHP: International life sciences institute center for health promotion; SOFIT: System for observing fitness instruction time; CATCH: Child and adolescent trial for cardiovascular health.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="57782" xml_f="57801" txt_i="42672" txt_f="42691">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="57812" xml_f="57870" txt_i="42692" txt_f="42750">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="57892" xml_f="57914" txt_i="42752" txt_f="42774">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="57925" xml_f="58264" txt_i="42775" txt_f="43114">JD conceived of the study.
