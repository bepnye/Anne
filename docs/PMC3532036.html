Meanwhile, the donor organ supply system in China has not yet been well established, and liver transplantation surgery is also not yet covered by medical insurance. As such, some patients who have an indication for surgery could still undergo liver transplant surgery with self-pay even though their tumor exceeds Milan criteria. Therefore, the high recurrence rate remains a problem that greatly reduces the long-term survival of these patients. Sorafenib has shown good efficacy in treating advanced liver cancer. Therefore, in this preliminary study, we explored the potential role of sorafenib in preventing and treating tumor recurrence after liver transplantation in patients with primary hepatic carcinoma exceeding the Milan criteria.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><offsets xml_i="6623" xml_f="6644" txt_i="3232" txt_f="3253">Materials and methods</offsets></title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title><offsets xml_i="6684" xml_f="6692" txt_i="3254" txt_f="3262">Patients</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6703" xml_f="7222" txt_i="3263" txt_f="3782">A total of 97 patients underwent liver transplantation at our department between March 2008 and June 2010.

All procedures were performed using conventional orthotopic liver transplantation methods without venovenous bypass. The “tumor-free operation” principle was followed during surgery. The following measures were taken to prevent tumor spread: excessive mechanical pressure on the tumor or repeated movement of the liver was avoided, and tumors located on the liver surface were covered with gauze; if the tumor adhered to the surrounding diaphragm, abdominal wall or omentum majus, the adhered local tissues were resected; if the tumor was located close to the first porta hepatis, at least 2 cm of the hepatic portal vein was resected, or the main portal vein was to be ligated in advance; during surgery, 5-fluorouracil 1 g was slowly infused via the peripheral vein, while epirubicin 20 mg was infused intravenously during the anhepatic period in patients with portal vein tumor thrombi; during dissociation of the liver arteries, the lymph nodes were dissected near the common hepatic artery and inside the hepatoduodenal ligament; and during the anhepatic period and before closure of the abdomen, the abdominal cavity was rinsed thoroughly with 2000 mL of warm, sterile distilled water.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9014" xml_f="9027" txt_i="5524" txt_f="5537">Tumor staging</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9038" xml_f="9364" txt_i="5538" txt_f="5864">Hepatocellular carcinoma stage was determined based on intraoperative findings and postoperative pathology using the International Union Against Cancer tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging criteria.

The disease and overall survival curves (drawn using the Kaplan–Meier method) show that sorafenib conferred significantly longer survival than did capecitabine. Therefore, administration of sorafenib for some time after transplantation may improve the prognosis in patients with liver cancer exceeding the Milan criteria, with efficacy superior to that of capecitabine.

Patients with postoperative pathology showing abdominal lymph node metastasis and/or intravascular cancer emboli in the hepatic vein system are more likely to experience tumor relapse and their prognosis is likely to be poor. For these patients, sorafenib should be administered as early as possible. The main adverse reactions in the sorafenib group included diarrhea and hand-foot syndrome, which resolved after reducing the sorafenib dose. The incidence of severe adverse reactions (grade 3 or above) was very low. Sorafenib may also be discontinued, if necessary, and then resumed at a lower dose (eg, 200 mg bid) once the toxicities have been resolved. In such settings, subsequent severe toxic effects are rare.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20621" xml_f="20954" txt_i="15886" txt_f="16219">In summary, the results of this preliminary study indicate that, for patients with advanced liver cancer exceeding the Milan criteria, prophylactic use of sorafenib after liver transplantation can improve prognosis and prolong survival, with an acceptable toxicity profile. Further studies are needed to confirm the present findings.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-ott-5-457"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of
