The content validity index of the total scale was 0.89; this was acceptable.

Cronbach's α was 0.78. The participants agreed with the positive effects of the interventional program on the outcome of pregnancy and the prevention of obesity. Most of them, however, did not know that healthy eating can cause the childhood well-being of their fetuses. Eight questions about limited time, the absence of enjoyability, tiredness, hunger, obedience with family members' tastes, unsuccessful experience of dietary advices, and Pica-evaluated perceived barriers, which were effective in about 30% on the basis of pretest results (Cronbach's α = 0.80), were asked. Perceived self-efficacy questions involving the following of the food pyramid, eating healthy foods, and considering orders in different places and conditions were asked in seven items. The average of the mothers' scores was about 65 and Cronbach's α was 0.82. Positive feelings such as happiness, success, well-being of the mother and the fetus were included in four questions and negative feeling such as depression was evaluated in one question (Cronbach's α = 0.84). Around 80% of the subjects were in agreement with the positive effect of healthy eating and 20% of the subjects demonstrated a negative feeling. Three categories of questions including the persons who help and encourage the pregnant mother to obey the recommended points were used to measure interpersonal influences (including 10 items for husbands, 4 items for friends, and 8 items for families). A question, for example, was “Does your husband help you find healthy foods?” Cronbach's α for husband and family supports were 0.90 and 0.92, respectively. Husbands, mothers, and mothers-in-law were the most encouraging. Good appearance, reading of the booklet, and participation in classes to encourage subjects were measured for situational influences; for these factors, Cronbach's α was 0.70. More than half of the mothers preferred to participate in classes, and then, to read the booklet. Appearance was important in about 20% of the subjects. Eating in parents' homes, restaurants, and fast food outlets were the most evaluated preferences (Cronbach's α = 0.77). A daily record and the buying of healthy foods as the first priority were considered for commitment to plans, and Cronbach's α for this scale was 0.79. Buying the best food products as the first priority was estimated in about 80% of the mothers and a small percentage were confident that they could adjust their schedule for the recommended points.

The researcher asked them to support pregnant mothers with healthy eating. Being familiar with the immediately competing demands, the preferences for dietary pattern were taught through computer-based instruction in the third session.

The limitations of this study were partly due to the nature of that. This was primarily an educational intervention, and therefore, we could not design a two- or three-blinded trial. In addition, filling the questionnaire enhanced the control group questions, and consequently, the nutritional knowledge that accompanied dietary counseling as a part of the standard maternity care that might have influenced the control's dietary pattern and the study results. To remain within the word limit, we did not discuss nutrient intake in this paper.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title><offsets xml_i="31138" xml_f="31148" txt_i="22620" txt_f="22630">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31159" xml_f="31439" txt_i="22631" txt_f="22911">The usage of Pender's HPM for nutrition education is effective for the compliance of pregnant women on the dietary guideline and the food guide pyramid.
