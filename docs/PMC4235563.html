MI patients experience mental and emotional problems such as depression and anxiety. These complications could cause delay in resuming work, decreased quality of life and increased risk of death. The role of education in facilitating adaptation is very important in these patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of written material and verbal method education on anxiety and depression in patients with myocardial infarction in Urmia hospital in 2009.

HADS is formulated in a language that is readily understandable. To increase the acceptability, symptoms of severe psychopathology were omitted. Likewise, symptoms that can be caused by somatic illnesses were not included. HADS is well accepted in somatically ill patients, population settings and oncology cases. HADS-D focuses mainly on the reduced pleasure response aspect of depression, whereas HADS-A focuses mainly on generalized anxiety issues of worry and fears of the future, with one item for panic attacks. Each item is scored from 0 (minimally present) to 3 (maximally present), and the sum score on each subscale (HADS-A and HADS-D) ranges from 0 to 21. Among the several instruments designed for psychiatric diagnoses, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) distinguishes itself from all other scales due to its ability to assess anxiety and depression without investigating somatic symptoms. HADS is often used to analyze a variety of diseases in the clinical setting.  This method was developed in 1983 and consists of a series of 14 questions, 7 of which are related to anxiety (HAD-A) while the other 7 questions are related to depression (HAD-D). The creators  of the scale considered a score of less than 8 suggesting lack of any mental disorder, a score equal to or greater than 8 suggesting a disorder be “probably” present, while a score above 10 was considered to indicate that a patient was “highly likely” to have a disorder.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10829" xml_f="10941" txt_i="6897" txt_f="7009">HADS has been used to help diagnose patients suffering from chest pain, atypical chest pain and heart disease.  </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10948" xml_f="11125" txt_i="7010" txt_f="7187">We excluded patients with clinical conditions instability.

One study, conducted among MI patients in Canada, revealed that both major depression and elevated BDI scores predicted cardiac mortality 6 months after acute MI regardless of the severity of infarction. By the 18-month follow-up, 21 patients had died, 19 (8.6%) due to cardiac causes.

Of course, generalizability of the results of this systematic review is guarded. We cannot state that the findings are appropriate to the patients providing their own care. </offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title><offsets xml_i="19115" xml_f="19125" txt_i="14615" txt_f="14625">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19136" xml_f="19647" txt_i="14626" txt_f="15137">The study findings showed the difficulties that patients experience in the period after MI. Immediately after discharge, health care systems should consider patients' needs for psychological support and educational needs. To provide effective psychological interventions, counseling should include comprehensive assessment of anticipated difficulties and worries that postpone adjustment. Identification of individual concerns is essential so that counseling and teaching can be suitable to the patients’ needs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19654" xml_f="20156" txt_i="15138" txt_f="15640">More attention should be paid to the cultural aspects of patient teaching in discharge planning. Adequate teaching is needed to decrease patient uncertainty about issues needed for successful relaxation. The importance of written instructions and recommendations should be emphasized to change stressful behaviors. The significance of exercise participation and being relaxed for improving patients' health should be stressed. Educative-counseling programs should be based on the needs of MI patients. </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20163" xml_f="20451" txt_i="15641" txt_f="15929">Reduction of depression and anxiety by written materials and verbal method education has many benefits in recovery from disease and control of other adverse outcomes. Replication of the study by using a larger sample and longitudinal design and other educational methods are recommended. </offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Many individuals from Urmia and Shiraz Universities of Medical Sciences have contributed to the completion of this study.
