On the basis of statistical analysis of variance, the exposure to GLPG0259 increased in proportion to the dose over a 30–150 mg single-dose range and a 25–75 mg repeated-dose range. Between- and within-subject variability in GLPG0259 pharmacokinetics was low/moderate (coefficient of variation [CV] 16–30%). After once-daily repeated dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations were reached at between 5 and 8 dosing days, which is consistent with the long apparent elimination half-life of GLPG0259. Food increased the bioavailability of GLPG0259 given in a solid dosage form.

The disease is characterized by pain, stiffness, and restricted mobility due to persistent symmetrical inflammation of the synovial membranes of multiple joints, which ultimately results in irreversible damage of the joint cartilage and bone.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1"><offsets xml_i="7134" xml_f="7135" txt_i="3777" txt_f="3778">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7142" xml_f="7143" txt_i="3778" txt_f="3779">–</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3"><offsets xml_i="7175" xml_f="7176" txt_i="3779" txt_f="3780">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7183" xml_f="7184" txt_i="3780" txt_f="3781">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7191" xml_f="7989" txt_i="3782" txt_f="4580">Development of the disease involves an inflammatory response of the synovial membrane, accompanied by infiltration of a variety of immune cells, which leads to the build-up and maintenance of a cytokine network. One of the cytokines central to this network is tumor necrosis factor (TNF), as is clearly demonstrated by the clinical success of TNF blockers in treating RA. TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines contribute to cartilage and bone erosion by inducing release of degradative enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and stimulating the release of receptor-activated NFκB-ligand (RANKL), which triggers differentiation of hematopoeitic cells into bone-resorbing osteoclasts. When left untreated, the disease leads to significant disability associated with high economic costs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7996" xml_f="8584" txt_i="4581" txt_f="5169">In recent years, the therapeutic management of patients with RA has undergone major evolution. Up to 10 years ago, therapeutic approaches relied on synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate and sulphasalazine, which had only partial clinical benefit and were associated with significant toxicity. A considerable advance in the effective treatment of RA came from the introduction of the biologic therapeutics that neutralize cytokines or their receptors (TNFα and interleukin [IL]-6) or that inhibit cellular activation (B-cell or T-cell activation).[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"><offsets xml_i="8616" xml_f="8617" txt_i="5169" txt_f="5170">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8624" xml_f="8625" txt_i="5170" txt_f="5171">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5"><offsets xml_i="8657" xml_f="8658" txt_i="5171" txt_f="5172">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8665" xml_f="8666" txt_i="5172" txt_f="5173">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8673" xml_f="8909" txt_i="5174" txt_f="5410">However, because of the high production costs, inconvenience of parenteral administration, increased risk of infections, and potential immunogenicity of biologics, there is still a need for less expensive and orally administered drugs.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"><offsets xml_i="8941" xml_f="8942" txt_i="5410" txt_f="5411">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8949" xml_f="9098" txt_i="5411" txt_f="5560">] Hence, the development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting disease-relevant signal transduction pathways is being pursued by various companies.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6"><offsets xml_i="9130" xml_f="9131" txt_i="5560" txt_f="5561">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9138" xml_f="9139" txt_i="5561" txt_f="5562">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9146" xml_f="9859" txt_i="5563" txt_f="6276">GLPG0259 is a small-molecule inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase–activated protein kinase 5 (MAPKAPK5), a kinase enzyme that plays a role in important inflammatory pathways.

MAPKAPK5 belongs to a family of mitogen-activated protein kinases that play an important role in several cellular processes, including inflammation, proliferation, and differentiation.

The model that was developed was then used to support the planning of the number and timing of the sparse samples to be taken per patient in the 3-month phase II study. An exploratory graphical analysis of the pharmacokinetics of GLPG0259 was performed. The graphical analysis consisted of plotting and comparing individual profiles and the smoothes of dose-normalized profiles. Dose linearity was evaluated by comparing the dose-normalized profiles. The exploratory graphical analysis plots were also scrutinized for food and formulation effects.

The feeding status or type of formulation had no influence on these AEs. All other AEs were typical phase I environment events, such as somnolence, fatigue, headache, oropharyngeal pain, and nasopharyngitis. No clinically relevant trends or changes were observed in the median laboratory and urinalysis values over time. A single case of a mild alanine aminotransferase increase was observed in a subject at the 75 mg dose in the second study. Across the four studies, no clinically relevant trends or changes were observed in the median vital sign values and ECG parameters over time. No treatment-emergent abnormalities related to vital signs or ECG parameters were observed in more than one subject during the trials. None of the abnormalities related to vital signs or ECG parameters were considered clinically relevant by the investigators.

Consequently, development of an oral solid dosage form was envisaged. GLPG0259 free base is poorly soluble in aqueous media, and its solubility decreases with increasing pH (&lt;0.01 mg/mL at pH 7). Two approaches were developed in parallel to overcome this low solubility and to improve compound bioavailability after dosing in a solid dosage form. The first approach was a salt screening, which resulted in the selection of the fumarate salt for further formulation development work. The water solubility of the GLPG0259 fumarate salt, as compared with that of the free base, was increased to 1.9–2.7 mg/mL. The impact of the improvement in solubility was confirmed in a comparative bioavailability study in fasted dogs. In that study, GLPG0259 fumarate salt (suspension in 20% [w/v] hydroxypropyl-ß–cyclodextrin, pH 3, or as crystalline powder in capsule form) resulted in plasma exposure similar to that of GLPG0259 free base in suspension in 20% acidified hydroxypropyl-ß–cyclodextrin, but 4-fold higher plasma exposure than that of GLPG0259 free-base crystalline powder in capsule form (data not shown). In humans, administration of GLPG0259 fumarate salt as a crystalline powder in capsule form leads to 50% lower bioavailability than that of GLPG0259 free base given as a solution in 40% (w/v) hydroxypropyl-ß–cyclodextrin, pH 3 (study 3). The lower performance of the fumarate capsule in humans than in dogs is explained by the higher percentage of hydroxypropyl-ß–cyclodextrin (40% versus 20%) in the liquid formulation, which enhances GLPG0259 free-base solubility. Concomitant food intake with the solid dosage form prevents this decrease in bioavailability by increasing the solubility further. The second approach was the improvement of GLPG0259 solubility by physical modifications of the drug substance – in particular, the development of solid dispersion formulations with GLPG0259 free base in an amorphous form homogenously dispersed in a polymer matrix. The free-base solid dispersion as a powder or pellets filled into capsules was tested in fasted dogs, and both solid dispersion formulations showed GLPG0259 plasma exposure similar to that of the fumarate salt as a crystalline powder in capsule form. Similar results were obtained in humans (study 4).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="67517" xml_f="67644" txt_i="55874" txt_f="56001">In the Biopharmaceutical Classification System, drugs are classified according to measurements of solubility and permeability.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20"><offsets xml_i="67677" xml_f="67679" txt_i="56001" txt_f="56003">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="67686" xml_f="67835" txt_i="56003" txt_f="56152">] Regarding GLPG0259, it is a poorly soluble compound, with solubility that decreases with increased pH.
