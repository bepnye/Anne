Some reasons that churches may not have wanted to participate include 1) not wanting to add a new program because of numerous existing outreach efforts (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"><offsets xml_i="36236" xml_f="36238" txt_i="29451" txt_f="29453">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36245" xml_f="37015" txt_i="29453" txt_f="30223">); 2) lack of positive experiences with research participation (with only 22% of our sample having participated in research projects during the last 2 years); and 3) considering diabetes to be a medical condition best handled by health care professionals in a clinical setting. If the church is to play an important role in supporting self-management behaviors for African Americans (within the framework of chronic disease management), then the success of programs such as A New DAWN may increase the community‚Äôs awareness of how churches can play a role in improving diabetes care. Second, the role of the CDA in interventions such as A New DAWN will need additional evaluation to assess its potential in facilitating church support systems for patients with diabetes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37022" xml_f="37165" txt_i="30224" txt_f="30367">Participants recruited from churches for A New DAWN differed in important ways from participants in other clinic-based diabetes interventions (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><offsets xml_i="37197" xml_f="37199" txt_i="30367" txt_f="30369">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37206" xml_f="37207" txt_i="30369" txt_f="30370">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"><offsets xml_i="37239" xml_f="37241" txt_i="30370" txt_f="30372">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37248" xml_f="37249" txt_i="30372" txt_f="30373">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40"><offsets xml_i="37281" xml_f="37283" txt_i="30373" txt_f="30375">40</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37290" xml_f="37523" txt_i="30375" txt_f="30608">) conducted in central North Carolina.

Other limitations include 1) a study design that does not allow for evaluation of specific program components on outcome variables (e.g., the independent effects of the CDA or physician messages on metabolic or behavioral changes) and 2) outcome measures that focus primarily on people with diabetes, so the impact of intervention components such as the CHAT, church bulletin board, and CDA on behaviors and awareness of diabetes among church members are not adequately assessed.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38625" xml_f="39173" txt_i="31581" txt_f="32129">To address the high prevalence of diabetes among African Americans, more research is needed to develop effective community-based programs. Eliminating the health disparities associated with diabetes requires culturally appropriate and effective interventions that address the individual's role in self-management and the community's role in supporting self-care. In an attempt to meet this need for effective interventions, we developed A New DAWN as a culturally appropriate program that incorporates salient aspects of the chronic disease model (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="39204" xml_f="39205" txt_i="32129" txt_f="32130">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39212" xml_f="39425" txt_i="32130" txt_f="32343">).
