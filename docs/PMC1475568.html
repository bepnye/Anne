We used health educators, not nurses or physicians, to deliver the intervention. By using less highly trained individuals to deliver the intervention, we enabled nurses and physicians to perform clinical tasks more commensurate with their training. Other studies that have performed global cost estimates have found that the savings from reductions in hospitalizations exceed the cost of the intervention [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="33356" xml_f="33357" txt_i="26378" txt_f="26379">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33364" xml_f="33366" txt_i="26379" txt_f="26381">].</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33388" xml_f="33398" txt_i="26383" txt_f="26393">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33409" xml_f="33907" txt_i="26394" txt_f="26892">In conclusion, our heart failure self-management program, designed for patients of all literacy levels, appears to reduce rates of hospitalization and death. Patients with low literacy, and other vulnerable patients, may stand to benefit most from these programs. Further research into the design, implementation, and dissemination of disease management programs for low literacy patients will be crucial for meeting the health care needs of the growing population of patients with chronic illness.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33929" xml_f="33948" txt_i="26894" txt_f="26913">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33959" xml_f="34130" txt_i="26914" txt_f="27085">Drs.
