binge eating do not respond to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We present the sequential binge (SB), a new behavioral intervention that complements CBT, and preliminary results of its effects. SB breaks up the binge into repeated identical sequences of eating separated by incremental pauses. This pattern of ingestion aims at facilitating boredom toward the ingested foods and at turning cognitive control away from binge food restriction. SB is hypothesized to reduce food intake during the binge and the number of daily binges.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title><offsets xml_i="9799" xml_f="9806" txt_i="620" txt_f="627">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9817" xml_f="10070" txt_i="628" txt_f="881">Prospective pilot study.

Likewise, food intake did not account for the reduction in binge number the day after SB. Instead, we postulate that the reduction of daily binge number after SB is related to the specific rules of ingestion during SB. Those rules are designed to train and reorient cognitive control abilities away from optimizing binge food restriction during the binge. Indeed, there is an increasing amount of evidence showing that patients plan food restriction and reinforce their dietary rules during binges, which in turn promotes subsequent binge episodes [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0165696.ref001" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="58788" xml_f="58789" txt_i="37949" txt_f="37950">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="58796" xml_f="58797" txt_i="37950" txt_f="37951">,</offsets><xref rid="pone.0165696.ref010" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="58845" xml_f="58847" txt_i="37951" txt_f="37953">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="58854" xml_f="58999" txt_i="37953" txt_f="38098">].

However, we observed that SB was overall implemented less than regular binges. This could signal a motivational issue rather than difficulties in implementing SB. Indeed, patients preferred regular binges rather than SB because of a higher pleasure with regular binges. Motivation to implement SB could be raised by investigating patients' thoughts and feelings (and especially their sensation of loss of control) after they experienced SBs vs. regular binges.

In addition, half of the participants reached binge abstinence for at least one month. This justifies the need of a randomized controlled trial to provide a full overview of the immediate and long term effects of SB.
