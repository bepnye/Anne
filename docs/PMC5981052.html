SMS notifications were also sent to 45 patient-identified social supporters for sustained adherence lapses in the scheduled SMS and triggered SMS arms. Study participants and social supporters participated in qualitative semistructured in-depth interviews on acceptability and feasibility of this technology. An inductive, content analytic approach, framed by the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model, was used to analyze qualitative data. Quantitative feasibility data, including device functionality and SMS tracking data, were recorded based upon device metrics collected electronically and summarized descriptively.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title><offsets xml_i="8867" xml_f="8874" txt_i="1601" txt_f="1608">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8885" xml_f="9252" txt_i="1609" txt_f="1976">A total of 63 participants participated in the study.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence is critical for achieving viral suppression, which leads to improved clinical outcomes and reduced secondary transmission.

When an individual opens it to take pills, the device records a date-and-time stamp. An internal modem and subscriber identity module card enable the device to send a real-time mobile signal to a secure Web server (hosted in South Africa) by General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). Receipt of this signal was taken as a proxy for taking medication. GPRS maintains the data in transit until acknowledgment of receipt by the Web server, which minimizes possible data loss because of power failure or lack of Internet connectivity. Data transmission is backed up by the SMS to mitigate possible temporal GPRS network disconnections. In the event of inadequate mobile network coverage, the monitor stores openings in flash memory and sends them when the network becomes available. The monitor also transmits a daily heart beat that indicates current battery life, remaining airtime balance, and signal strength as indication of its functionality. The monitor can be charged using electricity or a solar device. Its battery life was 3 months at the time of the study but has since been improved to 6 months.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24387" xml_f="24402" txt_i="14120" txt_f="14135">Data Collection</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="24413" xml_f="24653" txt_i="14136" txt_f="14376">Study participants were seen at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months for collection of socio-behavioral data and viral load assessment.

SMS text messages not only reminded patients to take medication in time but also enabled social supporters to provide medication-taking-related support.

Third, the study was conducted in a prototypical rural African setting, which has implications for similar settings, although cultural differences may have an impact on acceptability.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="63407" xml_f="63418" txt_i="47493" txt_f="47504">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="63429" xml_f="63702" txt_i="47505" txt_f="47778">However, results may have limited generalizability as they are based on a small pilot study of 63 participants over 9 months of follow-up. It is not clear how they manifest in larger, diverse contexts, with long-term follow-up. Importantly, HIV requires lifelong treatment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="63724" xml_f="63736" txt_i="47780" txt_f="47792">Implications</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="63747" xml_f="64230" txt_i="47793" txt_f="48276">A number of important implications for further use and development of this type of intervention arise from this study. First, the possibility of dependence on the intervention and its potential consequences on adherence after the withdrawal of the intervention warrants further investigation. We are currently carrying out a follow-up study to explore how these participants feel about the lack of the intervention and how they adhere to their ART after withdrawing the intervention.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="64237" xml_f="64643" txt_i="48277" txt_f="48683">Second, concerns of unwanted HIV status disclosure could potentially be further minimized by extending the use of the monitor in other diseases (especially nonstigmatized conditions such as hypertension), so that it is not associated with HIV. Other means for protecting against disclosure include using password-protected phones and training social supporters about the need to maintain patients’ privacy.</offsets></p><p><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="64684" xml_f="64686" txt_i="48684" txt_f="48686">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="64693" xml_f="64695" txt_i="48686" txt_f="48688">].</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="64717" xml_f="64727" txt_i="48690" txt_f="48700">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="64738" xml_f="65241" txt_i="48701" txt_f="49204">In conclusion, we found that real-time adherence monitoring, SMS text message reminders, and notifications to support ART medication adherence were largely acceptable based primarily on perceived utility and feasible in a research context within a low-resourced setting. Future efforts should focus on optimized device design, user training to overcome the challenges we encountered, cost-effectiveness studies, as well as studying the monitoring aspect of the device without accompanying interventions.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of Justus Ashaba, Judith Namanya, Moonlight Sheila, Moran Owembabazi, as well as those of Wisepill Technologies, Dimagi, and Yo!
