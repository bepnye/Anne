Given the small numbers in this study, however, more research is needed to evaluate true participation rates for proactive QL interventions initiated in the ED. In addition, despite screening over 200 smokers, only 40 (20%) were enrolled in the study. Once enrolled, half were unreachable or became disinterested in any smoking cessation interventions. Overall, a system such as this appears to be time consuming, yet promising from the perspective of compliance with the intervention. Clearly, feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial will first require a more efficient screening tool. Perhaps the most important issue is identifying patients who truly wish to cease smoking and referring them. Considerations such as targeting specific presenting complaints including chest pain or respiratory complaints may help increase interest in smoking cessation. Further research is required to assess whether this approach would improve efficiency of enrollment and lead to better success with follow-up.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23804" xml_f="24281" txt_i="17170" txt_f="17647">Convenience may be an important factor affecting compliance in the ED population and the completion rate for phone counseling intervention in this small population is encouraging given the evidence already available supporting the efficacy of proactive QL counseling.
