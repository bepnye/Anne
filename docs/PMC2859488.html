Descriptive statistics of the outcome measures will be performed as well as baseline characteristics and clinic measures, calculating means and standard deviations or percentages, with 95% confidence intervals at each assessment for all the patients and for each group. Chi-square tests will be carried out to assess the impact of RADT on the percentage of antibiotic prescription in the intervention and control arms. For assessing the cost-effectiveness study of RADT direct costs such as antibiotics prescribed, RADT costs, and number of follow-up visit and indirect costs such as sick leave days will be taken into account. The different antibiotics prescribed, the GABHS resistance rates, the clinical recurrences and the clinical criteria will also be determined to assess the secondary objectives. The level of significance of all models will be set at 5%. Statistical analysis will be carried out with SPSS v. 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and the SAS v. 9.1.3 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17610" xml_f="17615" txt_i="12278" txt_f="12283">Risks</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17626" xml_f="17921" txt_i="12284" txt_f="12579">We do not believe that the participants will be exposed to excessive risk by participation in this study since the visit schedule dictated by the protocol is similar to that undertaken in daily clinical practice.

In addition, the protocol is adapted to the way in which primary care physicians work and therefore implies neither ethical nor legal problems for its undertaking in our setting. The only difference with the usual practice will be the performance of RADT and the collection of the sample for culture. However, both procedures are relatively rapid and simple and are widely used in other countries. We hope there will not be any logistic problems with the submission of samples from the health care centers to the laboratory for culture since we will be personally responsible for this task. There are no major differences in the GABHS detection technique in the different laboratories of our setting and thus, no bias in this sense is expected. Centers and practitioners willing to participate may be more motivated professionals and will more likely to follow current guidelines and follow better clinical practice. This aspect could reduce the impact of the results obtained in relation to the optimization of treatment of acute pharyngitis with RADT. We do not expect many dropouts since the protocol is very similar to usual practice.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19266" xml_f="19299" txt_i="13874" txt_f="13907">Ethical and organizational review</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19310" xml_f="19604" txt_i="13908" txt_f="14202">The study will be conducted according to guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and the Good Clinical Research Practice.

The trial proposed is sufficiently powered and, to the best of our knowledge, the first to allow conclusions on the effect of RADTs in adults with pharyngitis. Pharyngotonsillitis is a very prevalent disease and is one of the most frequent causes of medical visits in primary care. Many patients in our country visit the physician in search of antibiotic prescription since they believe that this is the treatment of choice, particularly among patients with multiple disease recurrence. In other cases, patients seek home remedies or go directly to the pharmacy to obtain medications to alleviate the sore throat that accompanies pharyngitis. Primary care physicians are aware that when the patients visit they wish to receive effective treatment with medications which rapidly alleviate the accompanying symptomatology and, in many cases, what they want is treatment with an antibiotic. This is probably the main reason why physicians in our country mainly prescribe these medications together with the fact that it is clinically difficult to distinguish streptococcal from viral etiology. We believe that this clinical trial will be of great use to know whether the RADT are truly effective in reducing the percentage of antibiotic prescription in our setting.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21579" xml_f="21592" txt_i="16110" txt_f="16123">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21603" xml_f="21686" txt_i="16124" txt_f="16207">(RADT): Rapid antigen detection test; (GABHS): Group A beta-hemolyticstreptococcus.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21708" xml_f="21727" txt_i="16209" txt_f="16228">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21738" xml_f="21815" txt_i="16229" txt_f="16306">The Rapid Test Device OSOM StrepA of Genzyme will be kindly provided by Leti.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21837" xml_f="21859" txt_i="16308" txt_f="16330">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21870" xml_f="22401" txt_i="16331" txt_f="16862">JC and CL had the original idea of the study, obtained funding from the University and Innovation Department and from the Catalan Society of Family Medicine and helped with the drafting of the protocol.
