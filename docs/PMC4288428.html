Among the mechanisms implicated are hormonal systems such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which produces cortisol in humans. Current research employs speech stressors and social rejection stressors to understand hormonal responses in a laboratory setting. However, it is not clear whether social rejection stressors elicit hormonal reactivity. In addition to cortisol, progesterone has been highlighted as a potential stress- and affiliation-related hormone in humans. In the present study, 131 participants (70 men and 61 women) were randomly assigned to be exposed to one of four conditions: standardized speech stressor; speech control; social rejection task; or a control (inclusion) version of the social rejection task. Saliva samples were collected throughout the study to measure cortisol and progesterone. As hypothesized, we found the expected increase in cortisol in the speech stressor, and we also found that the social rejection task did not increase cortisol, underscoring the divergence between unpleasant experiences and HPA axis activity. However, we did not find evidence for progesterone increase either during the speech- or social rejection tasks. Compared with past studies on progesterone and stress in humans, the present findings present a mixed picture. Future work is needed to delineate the contexts and types of manipulations which lead to progesterone increases in humans.</offsets></p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>University of Notre Dame</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>NSF Graduate Student Fellowship</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded in part by discretionary funds to Michelle Wirth from the University of Notre Dame.

Whereas commonly-used speech stressors require literally thinking on one’s feet and making a vigorous (and ultimately futile) attempt to impress the judges, social rejection in laboratory tasks like Cyberball may or may not demand any expenditure of energy – in fact, it may be a situation in which no obvious actions can be taken. Therefore, it is unclear whether laboratory social rejection is a context in which the brain and body would activate a system designed to replenish energy.

Participants’ photographs were taken at the beginning of the session to accompany their character in the Cyberball game. Participants were told that the other two same-sex players (whose behavior was actually computer-generated) were located at another laboratory on campus. Before the game, experimenters made a fake phone call to the fictional lab; this call was intended to be overheard by participants to give the impression that the experimenters were synchronizing Cyberball players’ log-ins in the two labs. Names and photographs (students from another university) also accompanied computer players. As a supposed precaution, participants were asked to inform the experimenter at the beginning of the game if they knew the other participants. None of the participants indicated in their final study comments that they did not believe the Cyberball cover story. Participants were fully debriefed at the end of the study that the other players’ actions were generated by the computer. Participants played Cyberball for 5 minutes with two other players.

T-tests were used to compare participants’ ratings on these items in the inclusion (control) vs. exclusion (stress) condition. As expected, participants in the exclusion condition rated that a smaller percent of the throws were made to them, and that the other game-players included them less, as well as excluded them more. They were less likely to endorse that they made a connection or bonded with one or more of the other game-players, and they rated themselves as feeling more like an outsider, more non-existent, and less in control. They rated themselves as feeling less able to throw the ball as often as they wanted, and less that their performance had any effect on the direction of the game. They also were significantly more likely to endorse that the other game-players failed to perceive them as worthy and likeable people (all

Therefore, participants were clearly aware of the exclusion and had negative feelings about it.

In fact, in Cyberball exclusion, it is completely ambiguous why the other players cease throwing the ball to the participant.

One, to identify whether 'Cyberball', a frequently used task in the Social Neurosciences, elicits a significant cortisol response (and how that compares to the well described cortisol stress response of the Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). Two, to determine whether these stress tasks also elicit a significant change in circulating levels of progesterone, as previous research provided some evidence that progesterone might respond to a psychosocial stress task as well.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="83668" xml_f="83924" txt_i="39709" txt_f="39965">The authors report that there was no increase in cortisol to the 'Cyberball' task (although there was the expected increase in response to the TSST), and they further did not observe any significant change in progesterone levels in response to either task.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="83931" xml_f="84388" txt_i="39966" txt_f="40423">There are many positive things to be said about the study. The experimental design is innovative, and the major research questions (both relating to the stressfulness of Cyberball and the responsivity of progesterone to stress) are original. The combination of the two goals into one study is actually an added plus, as this allowed the cross-validation of a possible progesterone response to a stressful task using two different experimental manipulations.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="84395" xml_f="85147" txt_i="40424" txt_f="41176">The study is also nicely powered (n=131), although not completely balanced. The obvious main drawback of the study is the lack of significant results; unfortunately, the authors could not find any evidence for a progesterone response to stress, and no evidence for a cortisol response to stress. As with any negative finding, it would be important to actually estimate the expected effect size from previous studies and use that to compute the power for the current study - in other words, what were the chances of finding a significant effect given the sample size present in this experiment? That information would allow the reader some judgment as to whether no significant changes are to be expected even if larger sample sizes were to be assessed.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="85154" xml_f="86004" txt_i="41177" txt_f="42027">Related to this comment, the advantages and disadvantages of a between-subject versus within-subject design could also be discussed; since Cyberball and the TSST are conceptually and practically two very different tests, a within subject design could be envisioned where subjects are exposed to both the TSST and Cyberball in a counterbalanced manner, perhaps with one week difference. The net investment in time and effort would probably have been very similar, but the added advantage would have been to compare results in cortisol and progesterone within the individual (which might not have made a difference in case of insignificant stress responses to Cyberball, but still). This is not really a critique but rather a comment that could be entered into the discussion, to alert the reader to the possibility of alternative experimental designs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="86011" xml_f="86933" txt_i="42028" txt_f="42950">Another comment relates to the menstrual cycle phase, which the authors mentioned they couldn't control for in the current study. This is if course suboptimal and the authors already acknowledge this in the limitation section; however, they argue that the damage is minimal as they were interested in the change from baseline, rather than baseline differences, thus the chosen measure (AUCi) can compensate for the lack of menstrual cycle phase control. I am not convinced that this approach really resolves this particular problem - what if the magnitude of the change depends on the baseline level? For example, if you are already high at baseline, you won't see a strong response anymore? Even though there is no evidence for this in the current study, I would not be comfortable with accepting the advise that it is OK to not control for menstrual cycle phase when measuring progesterone levels in cycling young women.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="86940" xml_f="87887" txt_i="42951" txt_f="43898">One other aspect of the experimental design caught my attention - the authors mention that they used the essay writing about the dream job (which is part of the TSST control condition) to fill up the time difference between the Cyberball and the TSST sessions. While it is commendable to control for total time exposure, the authors have now in reality confounded the Cyberball with at least part of the TSST control condition - might that have induced some interaction effects? From Figure 2, it appears that the TSST control (TSST-C) is actually leading to a less pronounced circadian decline overall, and that the cortisol increase between sample 3 and 4 in the group of women is actually strongest in the TSST-C group. So by itself, the TSST-C might have some effects on at least cortisol; combining it with the other stress task you want to compare against might then present a suboptimal approach, and should be critically discussed as well.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="87894" xml_f="88428" txt_i="43899" txt_f="44433">On other point: In the past, effects from the biological sex of the TSST panel on the magnitude of the cortisol stress response in the test subjects has been observed. The paper doesn't mention the sex of the judges - were those mixed (one man, one woman), or unisex (which?), or changing depending on availability? For the Cyberball, what was the sex of the other 'players'? Depending on the setup, this should either be evaluated, or mentioned as a possible limitation as it could explain additional variation in the endocrine data.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="88435" xml_f="88687" txt_i="44434" txt_f="44686">Finally, one technical question: What was the reason for the three subsequent freeze-thaw cycles prior to performing the assay? Was that a recommendation by the manufacturer? This information should be added to the methods, rather than just stating it.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="88694" xml_f="89000" txt_i="44687" txt_f="44993">Overall, I think that this study is an important contribution to the literature.

Laboratory stressors might show cross-habituation, so that null effects in subsequent sessions would be ambiguous: are they due to habituation, or because those conditions do not produce hormonal responses?

In the other two conditions, participants were told that the essay’s content would not be judged or evaluated in any way. As for overlap between the Trier control and the Cyberball conditions, writing an essay under these instructions has been used in Trier control conditions frequently in our and other laboratories (e.g. our colleague Jessica Payne; see also Het

Having to write about one’s dream job when one is told the writing will not be evaluated or judged does not seem to elicit any cortisol response. Therefore, in the Cyberball condition, we expected that any response would be due to the Cyberball rejection manipulation, not due to the writing task.

I think that perhaps the term “cortisol dysregulation” or “HPA axis dysregulation” might be better than “high levels.” The evidence that cortisol responses during the TSST are associated with poorer health is very slim, as are the data linking total cortisol output over the day (both AUCg and AUCi) to physical health. There is some evidence that flatter diurnal cortisol slopes (a less steep decline in cortisol across the day) are associated with poorer physical health/mortality, but the picture is clearly incredibly complex, potentially involving glucocorticoid resistance and many other intervening factors. The idea that higher cortisol is bad is, I think, overly simplistic; “dysregulation” would more accurate.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="97119" xml_f="97708" txt_i="51070" txt_f="51659">Is loneliness the same as rejection?

I think it is important to make distinctions between loneliness and rejection/ostracism in the paper.  Also, to what extent might chronic loneliness drive HPA activity compared to fleeting loneliness? Is it perhaps only chronic loneliness that really matters?

It is said in the 'Introduction' that there are important implications of progesterone “for understanding psychological disorders.” A couple of specific implications would be helpful there. In the paragraph following that one, it was quite unclear to me whether elevated progesterone is good or bad for one’s health (or neither, or unknown). For example, the statement  “links progesterone to the beneficial effects of helping behavior on cardiovascular recovery from stress” makes it sounds like higher levels of progesterone are good. However, here and elsewhere in the paper, the direction of association (positive or negative) is omitted. Please go through and add in the direction of association throughout the paper, just so the reader is clear about which way the direction of effects are going.

The changes we have made are subtle, however, because we stand by the research cited which found associations between (a) loneliness with higher cortisol, (b) social isolation with robust glucocorticoid increases in laboratory animals, and (c) chronically high cortisol with poorer health outcomes (not to say that is the only type of HPA dysregulation associated with health issues). We acknowledge at the end of this paragraph that these relationships are complex, and poorly understood, which I think also underscores your point.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="102526" xml_f="103173" txt_i="55609" txt_f="56256">Loneliness vs. rejection: This is an excellent point, and though we do not believe these two conditions are identical or interchangeable, we do believe they involve similar kinds of subjective feelings, and also may share some physiological consequences (i.e., HPA axis activation). We have rewritten the second paragraph of the Introduction to be clearer that we are not conflating the two concepts, but that they are associated. We have also hinted at the need to study both acute rejection and long-term/chronic rejection or other forms of social isolation, although this is touched on more directly in the Discussion, where we are citing Adam

That said, there is evidence that psychological disorders as diverse as depression, PTSD, and schizophrenia are associated with lower levels of allopregnanolone compared with healthy controls (see Wirth 2011,

Progesterone, as the precursor for allopregnanolone, does not always show such differences; some evidence points to dysregulation in the enzymes needed to produce allopregnanolone from progesterone in psychopathologies, rather than differences in progesterone levels. However, measuring progesterone changes in response to social rejection and other stressors is relevant since progesterone levels are one factor (along with enzyme availability) that helps determine levels of neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone. As requested, we have added an example in the introduction (lower allopregnanolone in depression), and we have clarified the association between progesterone and affiliation in the sentence noted.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="105214" xml_f="105248" txt_i="58171" txt_f="58205">Unfortunately, we did not conduct

As per our response to Jens Pruessner, the other reviewer: We performed a post-hoc power analysis, calculated using the partial eta squared obtained in our omnibus ANOVA of .10, and found that, with our sample size of 131, we had power of .90 to detect an effect of this size.

The question appeared ambiguously on the questionnaire we administered: It was worded “How accepted/rejected did you feel?”, without explicit instructions to circle or indicate “accepted” vs. “rejected” – which most participants did not do, making their numerically rated responses uninterpretable. However, we would argue that from the post-Cyberball “manipulation check” questionnaire, participants not only were aware of the exclusion, but also had negative feelings. For example, as stated in the Results, participants in the Cyberball exclusion condition rated themselves as feeling more

These are arguably negative feelings, which were increased in the exclusion condition. Exclusion condition participants also scored lower on ratings of the other game-players perceiving them as worthy and likable people, which, while not a direct report of feelings, can reasonably be expected to be associated with feelings of rejection. However, it is true (and we state in the results) that there was no difference in particpants’ feelings of frustration or anger. We agree that Cyberball does not seem like a very powerful manipulation, that there may exist other social rejection manipulations might elicit more powerful feelings of rejection, and possibly also changes in cortisol or progesterone. We address this in the Discussion.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="107344" xml_f="108604" txt_i="60175" txt_f="61435">Directly testing energy utilization is an excellent idea – however, to accomplish this in practice could be logistically quite difficult. To accurately measure energy usage, participants are typically tested for several hours in sealed chambers so that all their oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output can be measured (i.e. calorimetry). Overnight stays are typically used to calculate basal metabolic rate, as for accurate measurement the sympathetic nervous system must not be activated due to novelty of the test environment, etc. let alone laboratory stressors. I don’t think blood glucose measurements would be an accurate way to measure energy consumption during stressors, since as glucose is depleted for energy during the stressor, it will be rapidly replenished by glucocorticoids, making interpretation of changes difficult. There are kinesiology and exercise physiology laboratories studying energy usage in humans, so one possible step forward might be a collaboration between e.g. kinesiologists and psychologists. However, one barrier is that these two groups are interested in very different research questions. For these reasons, directly measuring energy utilization is perhaps not an ideal first step forward for this line of research.</offsets></p></list-item></list><offsets xml_i="108627" xml_f="108628" txt_i="61436" txt_f="61437">
