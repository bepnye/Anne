Many of the problems presenting to general practitioners in socio-economically disadvantaged areas are not amenable to a purely medical solution, and would particularly benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. Socio-economic deprivation is also associated with those very factors (more psychosocial problems, greater need for health promotion, more chronic diseases, more need for patient enablement) that longer consultations have been shown to address. This paper describes our study protocol, which aims to evaluate whether a lengthened multidisciplinary primary care team consultation with families in a socially deprived area can improve the psychological health of mothers in the families.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="3863" xml_f="3877" txt_i="925" txt_f="939">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3888" xml_f="4668" txt_i="940" txt_f="1720">In a randomised controlled trial, families with a history of social problems, substance misuse or depression are randomly allocated to an intervention or control group.

Outcomes of families receiving the intervention will be compared to the control group who will receive only usual general practitioner care.

Measuring the health of a 'family' is difficult so it was decided to look for a target member of the family. Mothers are a key axis to the health and health care of families. There is evidence that mothers in deprived settings have poor mental health, and it is suggested that improved well-being of mothers is seen as a key target for improved family health and lifestyle.

The HADS was also chosen for several reasons. High levels of anxiety and depression are expected in mothers in this area. HADS has been widely used and validated in primary care settings and norms for communities are available.

A major strength of this study is that it provides both a new model of the consultation and the opportunity to evaluate it in a randomized controlled trial. This opportunity presents infrequently as many service developments are implemented before adequate evaluation. The study also sets out to recruit a population that is often excluded in other studies. As such, it may contribute towards a reduction in health inequity. The embedded nature of this study in general practices in a highly deprived area ensures generalisability to other deprived communities, but more particularly it promises relevance to primary care.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="25297" xml_f="25316" txt_i="20019" txt_f="20038">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="25327" xml_f="25387" txt_i="20039" txt_f="20099">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="25409" xml_f="25431" txt_i="20101" txt_f="20123">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="25442" xml_f="25585" txt_i="20124" txt_f="20267">DLW conceptualised the research.
