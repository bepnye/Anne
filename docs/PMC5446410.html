The remaining three DSM265-treated, TBS-negative participants of cohort 2 developed transient submicroscopic parasitaemia. Both participants receiving placebo 7 days before CHMI became TBS positive on day 11.

Such a drug would not need to be given before and after exposure to infectious mosquito bites because parasites are eliminated without a substantial time lag. In this phase 1 study, we assessed for the first time whether a single, oral dose of DSM265 is safe, well tolerated, and can prevent the development of parasitaemia in malaria-naive, healthy adults, when PfSPZ are inoculated 1–7 days after drug administration.

CHMI can be initiated at any time (no need to breed and infect mosquitoes). Hence, sequential and adaptive study designs can be used. Infection is highly reproducible and therefore the number of participants and infection controls can be minimised compared with natural exposure and mosquito-mediated CHMI.</offsets><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="43486" xml_f="43488" txt_i="30740" txt_f="30742">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43495" xml_f="43497" txt_i="30742" txt_f="30744">, </offsets><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="43531" xml_f="43533" txt_i="30744" txt_f="30746">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43540" xml_f="43903" txt_i="30746" txt_f="31109"> Also, the fully infectious dose is small enough to allow at least three replication cycles following the hepatic stage, hence activity against asexual blood stages can be assessed as wel. The present study is the first to combine all three advantages of the approach and will guide further clinical development of DSM265 as a single agent or combination partner.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43910" xml_f="44399" txt_i="31110" txt_f="31599">A limitation of such studies is the low sample size that misses small differences and rare safety issues. When unreplaceable dropouts occur, as in cohort 1A of this study, power further decreases. Other limitations of CHMI studies are related to their model character and the study population. CHMI is optimised to infect all inoculated volunteers, which is more stringent than in naturally acquired infection, in which only a fraction of bites of infected mosquitoes will lead to malaria.</offsets><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="44438" xml_f="44440" txt_i="31599" txt_f="31601">19</offsets></sup></xref><offsets xml_i="44453" xml_f="45553" txt_i="31601" txt_f="32701"> Such non-physiological inoculates are required to ascertain that the prophylactic effect of the drug is measured and not infectiveness of the inoculum. Additionally, CHMI uses only a single parasite strain or clone (most frequently NF54 or its derivative 3D7), whereas under natural conditions polyclonal infections occur. In addition to these parasitological aspects, phase 1 and CHMI trials recruit only volunteers who represent a small fraction of the target population (young and healthy adults), whereas the target population includes all age strata and vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and immunosuppressed patients. Additionally, the late TBS-positive parasitaemia in one participant in cohort 2 raises questions about the risk of possible delayed occurrence of parasitaemia after day 28 in cohort 1A. However, in the participant with delayed TBS positivity, a low-grade, qPCR-detectable parasitaemia was present from day 8. By contrast, in cohort 1A, all DSM265-treated volunteers remained negative with qPCR. Thus, a late presentation after day 28 is rather unlikely in our opinion.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45560" xml_f="46137" txt_i="32702" txt_f="33279">DSM265 was safe and well tolerated in this study's setting, with no clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECGs, or laboratory tests following oral dosing of 400 mg DSM265. The only serious adverse event, a bilateral pulmonary embolism, was not considered to be related to the investigational product, or any other study procedures such as PfSPZ Challenge or antimalarial rescue treatment. The long intercontinental flight and concomitant intake of oral contraceptives, two multiplicative risk factors for thromboembolic events, were the likely triggers for this event.</offsets><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46171" xml_f="46173" txt_i="33279" txt_f="33281">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46180" xml_f="46182" txt_i="33281" txt_f="33283">, </offsets><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46216" xml_f="46218" txt_i="33283" txt_f="33285">21</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="46232" xml_f="46783" txt_i="33286" txt_f="33837">A preliminary good safety profile makes DSM265 a highly promising candidate for further development as a chemoprophylactic antimalarial. Given 1 day before CHMI, all participants were fully protected. This action contrasts with chemoprophylaxis with several approved drugs that only act against the asexual blood stage (eg, chloroquine or mefloquine). Here, parasites must egress from the liver before they become susceptible to the drug. Other drugs such as the artemisinins have extremely short half-lives and offer no protection beyond a few hours.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46790" xml_f="47444" txt_i="33838" txt_f="34492">When given 7 days before CHMI (cohort 2), DSM265 efficacy was reduced. Prevention of malaria depended on the half-life of DSM265 and the concentration at the moment of CHMI, whereas the pre-erythrocytic development of the parasite was not sufficiently suppressed; all volunteers developed parasitaemia. Nevertheless, in three of six participants asexual blood stage growth was suppressed. Furthermore, we observed substantial variation in the time to peak plasma concentration. Despite fasting before and standardised food intake following DSM265 administration, a food effect cannot be excluded since drinking was not restricted following DSM265 intake.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47451" xml_f="47912" txt_i="34493" txt_f="34954">Despite the small sample size, this study provides important information on the potential of DSM265 both in chemoprotection and in malaria treatment.
