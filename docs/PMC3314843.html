Therefore, clinical outcome of 3 months steroid withdrawal, while using the above immunosuppressants, was analyzed. Clinical trial registry No. was NCT 01550445. Thirty de novo renal transplant recipients were enrolled, and prednisolone was slowly withdrawn 3 months post-transplantation by 2.5 mg at every two weeks, until 8 weeks. During steroid withdrawal, 10 patients (30.0%) discontinued the protocol and they were maintained on steroid treatment. Among 20 steroid free patients, 8 patients (40.0%) re-started the steroid within 12 months post-transplantation. By the study endpoint, 12 (40%) recipients did not take steroid and survival of patients and grafts was 100%. In conclusion, in kidney transplant patients, 3 months steroid withdrawal while taking tacrolimus, basiliximab and mycophenolate mofetil was not associated with increased mortality or graft loss. Despite various causes of failure of steroid withdrawal during the follow-up period, it is a strategy well advised for kidney transplant recipients with regard to long-term steroid-related complications.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acute Rejection</kwd><kwd>Basiliximab</kwd><kwd>Mycophenolate Mofetil</kwd><kwd>Renal Transplantation</kwd><kwd>Steroid Withdrawal</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4915" xml_f="4927" txt_i="1351" txt_f="1363">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4938" xml_f="5286" txt_i="1364" txt_f="1712">Although corticosteroids have played an important part in the maintenance of immunosuppression after kidney transplantation, they are associated with debilitating adverse effects, including diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, avascular necrosis, mood and appearance changes and growth retardation in children (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="5317" xml_f="5318" txt_i="1712" txt_f="1713">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5325" xml_f="6025" txt_i="1713" txt_f="2413">). The treatment of these steroid-related side effects adds to the cost of transplants. In addition, such side effects increase post-transplant non-compliance, which is associated with increased incidence of acute rejection, chronic allograft nephropathy and graft loss. Given the fact that patients' death with functioning graft was an important cause of graft loss after kidney transplantation (accounting for 42.5% of graft losses in one registry analysis), and that the leading cause of death with functioning graft was cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular risk factors appear to be the most important challenge to further improving the longevity of patients with successful renal transplants (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="6056" xml_f="6057" txt_i="2413" txt_f="2414">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6064" xml_f="6484" txt_i="2414" txt_f="2834">). Many of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases overlap with the side effects of corticosteroids, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and weight gain. In order to increase the patient survival after kidney transplantation, it is imperative to avoid or at least reduce such risk factors, as well as reduce the use of corticosteroids, without increasing the incidence of acute rejection of the kidney graft.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6491" xml_f="7279" txt_i="2835" txt_f="3623">During the past few years, new immunosuppressants, such as tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and basiliximab, have been proven to decrease the incidence of acute rejection, possibly acting as potent substrates for safe steroid-free immunosuppression or steroid withdrawal. After transplantation, the major concern with any immunosuppression withdrawal protocol is the increased risk of acute and chronic rejection, potentially leading to graft damage and dysfunction or loss. Therefore, the goal of steroid withdrawal protocols is to eliminate steroid-related side-effects, while not increasing the rates of acute rejection or chronic graft loss. Development of more effective immunosuppressive agents has led to renewed attempts at steroid withdrawal after kidney transplantation (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="7310" xml_f="7311" txt_i="3623" txt_f="3624">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7318" xml_f="7621" txt_i="3624" txt_f="3927">). One of meta-analyses about the steroid withdrawal protocols applied between 7 days and 12 months post-transplantation reported that the incidence of acute rejection was increased; however, the graft and patient survival was not altered, and there was marked reduction in cardiovascular risk factors (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="7652" xml_f="7653" txt_i="3927" txt_f="3928">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7660" xml_f="8498" txt_i="3928" txt_f="4766">). Although there are many controversies about the clinical outcome after steroid avoidance or withdrawal, it is generally associated with higher rate of steroid-sensitive acute rejections, while avoiding steroid-related adverse effects. In regards with the interval between the steroid withdrawal and the transplantation, it is generally recognized that earlier steroid avoidance or withdrawal after transplantation is associated with higher rate of acute graft rejection and with lower rate of steroid-related adverse effects for the patient. Another recent meta-analysis demonstrated that steroid withdrawal performed between 3 and 6 months after renal transplantation was found to increase the incidence of acute rejection in patients on cyclosporine, but not tacrolimus, whereas no impact on graft and patient survival was reported (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="8529" xml_f="8530" txt_i="4766" txt_f="4767">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8537" xml_f="8539" txt_i="4767" txt_f="4769">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8546" xml_f="8972" txt_i="4770" txt_f="5196">In the present study, we analyzed clinical outcomes of kidney transplantation recipients on steroid withdrawal protocol applied 3 months after renal transplantation, using tacrolimus, MMF and basiliximab, and also compared clinical characteristics of patients in whom corticosteroids were successfully withdrawn with those of patients in whom corticosteroids had to be reinitiated because of acute rejection or other problems.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><offsets xml_i="9023" xml_f="9044" txt_i="5198" txt_f="5219">MATERIALS AND METHODS</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9064" xml_f="9076" txt_i="5220" txt_f="5232">Study design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9087" xml_f="9355" txt_i="5233" txt_f="5501">This study was an open-label, prospective, controlled clinical trial at a single center, with withdrawal of steroid at 3 months after renal transplantation.

However, well-known side effects of corticosteroids have increased the interest in steroid-withdrawal immunosuppression for kidney transplant recipients, and the goal of steroid minimization protocols has been to eliminate or minimize steroid-related side-effects, while not increasing the rates of acute rejection or graft loss. It is widely believed that the safety of steroid-free immunosuppression has improved the quality of life of kidney recipients since the mid-1990s, with the availability of tacrolimus and MMF and especially, with the regular use of induction antibody therapy.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20287" xml_f="20295" txt_i="15589" txt_f="15597">Hricik (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="20326" xml_f="20327" txt_i="15597" txt_f="15598">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20334" xml_f="20657" txt_i="15598" txt_f="15921">) showed that withdrawal of steroid in early phase after renal allograft transplantation was dangerous and could lead to clinical acute rejection with an incidence of 30% to 50%.

Our present study demonstrated that one patient (3.7% of ITT population) had an episode of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (Banff IA) and 4 patients (14.8% of ITT population) had borderline changes on the graft biopsy within 1 yr post-transplantation. Five patients with acute rejection or borderline change were treated easily with oral dose of steroid and were maintained on steroid during the follow-up period. Given the fact that only 5 patients (16.7% of enrolled subjects) had either biopsy-confirmed acute rejection or borderline change on the graft biopsy, the incidence of acute rejection within a year after transplantation was lower than that in previous reports. Furthermore, the fact that neither patient death nor graft loss occurred within 1 yr post-transplantation in our study population strongly suggests that steroid can safely be withdrawn from tacrolimus, basilixumab and MMF-treated renal allograft recipients. The reason that steroid can be withdrawn could partly be explained by the special relationship between FK binding protein 52 (FKBP-52) and glucocorticoid receptor compound (GCR) (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><offsets xml_i="21884" xml_f="21886" txt_i="17040" txt_f="17042">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21893" xml_f="22061" txt_i="17042" txt_f="17210">).

Because we applied our protocol to 30 transplant recipients, additional studies in larger number of kidney recipients should be necessary. The second limitation was that we did not perform protocol biopsies. Although mean creatinine levels remained unchanged in our patient population, there was the possibility that we failed to observe some progressive fibrosis due to the absence of prednisone maintenance therapy.
