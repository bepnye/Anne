Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either BLTR or PLTR surgery, stratified by surgeon. The sequences were computer-generated by an independent statistician.

The possibility of effect modification between group and a-priori defined factors such as surgeon, preoperative trichiasis severity, papillary inflammation, age, and sex was investigated by including interaction terms in the model and using a likelihood ratio test to assess statistical significance of the interaction term. Ordered categorical secondary outcomes (changes in visual acuity and corneal opacity, bleeding, and patient-reported outcomes) were compared between the two surgical interventions using ordinal logistic regression. Categorical secondary outcomes (type and location of recurrent lashes, ECAs, and entropion correction) were analysed using multinomial logistic regression to estimate relative risk ratio (RRR) and 95% CI. Negative binomial regression was used to analyse the difference in the number of recurrent lashes touching the eye between the two intervention groups. The signed-rank test was used to analyse visual acuity and contrast sensitivity changes between baseline and the 12 month follow-up. The risk of trichiasis recurrence difference by surgeon between the two surgical interventions was analysed using logistic regression adjusted for baseline disease severity such as entropion and trichiasis. To investigate the possibility of a learning curve effect during recruitment, the trichiasis recurrence rates for the first 50% of cases to be recruited versus the second 50% of cases recruited for each surgeon were compared using logistic regression adjusted for baseline disease severity such as entropion and trichiasis.

If the recorded differences in recurrence were due to poor surgical technique, we would anticipate this to be more apparent by 10 days.

A higher rate of postoperative infection occurred following BLTR, probably because of the skin incision. All infections were treated successfully with oral antibiotics. The skin and orbicularis incision probably also explains the greater intraoperative and postoperative bleeding and postoperative pain that occurred with the BLTR procedure because these structures have an extensive vascular and sensory supply. These are important considerations for improving surgical uptake, which might be reduced by patient reports of pain and bleeding. Participants reported very high levels of satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome and effect of surgery in alleviating the trichiasis in both groups at 12 months. There was no difference by group. However, some caution needs to be taken in drawing firm conclusions from such data; the questions were asked by members of the study team, and there could be some reticence in expressing dissatisfaction in this context. Of note, the Kenyan National Trachoma Control Programme recently switched from the BLTR to PLTR surgery because of reports of widespread patient dissatisfaction with the appearance of the full-thickness incision in BLTR surgery. Under-correction was more frequent with BLTR surgery at 12 months, suggesting it is less effective at correcting underlying entropion.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44315" xml_f="44744" txt_i="33626" txt_f="34055">We found that BLTR had a lower rate of mild ECAs.

The baseline, 6 month, and 12 month observers were masked to the randomisation. However, to independently assess the primary outcome for observer bias, photographs in which the upper lid skin was covered by a mask were graded. We found that the analysis of primary outcome using field and photograph grading were comparable, showing no systematic bias in the field grading. The observations of some of the secondary outcomes made during the operative procedure and at 10 days were impossible to mask. The use of surgeons who had previously been trained in PLTR and then provided with a second round of training in BLTR could be viewed as a potential limitation. However, we think that there was ample pre-trial training, practice, and assessment to bring the surgeons to a proficient standard, and that there is clear evidence that during the trial high standards were maintained, as discussed above. In this trial we used silk sutures, which were removed at 10 days. Although absorbable sutures such as polyglactan-910 (vicryl) offer the operational advantage of not needing to be removed, we have previously found in a randomised trial that silk and absorbable sutures have comparable outcomes, and therefore it is unlikely that the outcome of this present study would be modified by their use.</offsets><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="47854" xml_f="47855" txt_i="36903" txt_f="36904">8</offsets></sup></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="47875" xml_f="48452" txt_i="36905" txt_f="37482">Overall, the PLTR procedure was superior to the BLTR in terms of lower trichiasis recurrence and fewer intraoperative and immediate postoperative complications.
