Consistent with self-verification theory, several studies among adults have provided evidence to suggest that people higher in depression are more inclined to actively seek out (or prefer) negative social feedback, as well as interaction partners likely to provide them with such unfavorable feedback. For instance, Swann and colleagues observed that depressed college students, relative to controls, preferred friends who evaluated them negatively, were more inclined to seek negative feedback from their roommates, and preferentially solicited unfavorable feedback from their dating partners (Swann, Wenzlaff, Krull, &amp; Pelham, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45"><offsets xml_i="8720" xml_f="8724" txt_i="4753" txt_f="4757">1992</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8731" xml_f="9121" txt_i="4757" txt_f="5143">). Moreover, when presented with self-discrepant (i.e., positive) feedback, adults high on depressive symptoms appeared to attempt to restore their sense of worthlessness by subsequently seeking feedback about their weaknesses from a different evaluator; whereas adults low on depressive symptoms were more likely to solicit feedback about their strengths (Swann, Wenzlaff, &amp; Tafarodi, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46"><offsets xml_i="9154" xml_f="9158" txt_i="5143" txt_f="5147">1992</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9165" xml_f="9384" txt_i="5147" txt_f="5366">).

They found that children who were more depressed showed a greater preference for receiving feedback of a negative nature, based on responses to a questionnaire assessing feedback preferences in four distinct self-relevant domains (i.e., social, intellectual, athletic, and physical attractiveness). As noted by the authors, an important limitation of this study was the unknown predictive validity of their feedback preference questionnaire. Hence, it is unclear to what extent scores on this measure converge with participants’ actual preference for negative feedback in the face of actually occurring events (see Joiner et al., </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25"><offsets xml_i="10443" xml_f="10447" txt_i="6302" txt_f="6306">1997</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10454" xml_f="10456" txt_i="6306" txt_f="6308">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10463" xml_f="10687" txt_i="6309" txt_f="6529">In the only study to examine feedback seeking in children using a community sample, Cassidy and colleagues used a bogus feedback paradigm to examine children’s actual feedback preferences (Cassidy, Ziv, Mehta, &amp; Feeney, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12"><offsets xml_i="10720" xml_f="10724" txt_i="6529" txt_f="6533">2003</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10731" xml_f="11679" txt_i="6533" txt_f="7481">). Specifically, participants provided personal information about themselves by completing a series of questionnaires. They were led to believe that their responses would be shown to peers from a different school who would use this information to answer specific questions of an evaluative nature about each participant. Next, participants were provided the opportunity to select some of the alleged answers to these questions, knowing that some answers would include negative feedback and others would include positive feedback. In line with findings for adults and children diagnosed with depression, children displaying higher depressive symptoms were more likely to display a relative preference for negative information about themselves. A similar pattern of findings consistent with self-verification theory was observed for the linkage between feedback preferences and global self-representations, as indexed by level of general self-esteem.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11686" xml_f="12588" txt_i="7482" txt_f="8384">An important contribution of the Cassidy et al. study is that it provides evidence to suggest that the tendency for depressed individuals to prefer rather negative feedback extends to moderately depressed children and adolescents, as indexed by level of self-reported depressive symptoms. However, the study is limited by its relatively narrow scope of inquiry with regard to the role of depressive symptoms. First, the potential role of state mood was not examined. Whereas self-verification theory claims that interest in negative feedback is motivated by negative self-views, an alternative explanation for the linkage between elevated depressive symptoms and more negative feedback preferences is that due to high levels of depressed state mood, people displaying elevated depressive symptoms are prone to be drawn to all that is negative, including unfavorable appraisals from others (e.g., Beck, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8"><offsets xml_i="12620" xml_f="12624" txt_i="8384" txt_f="8388">1967</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12631" xml_f="12664" txt_i="8388" txt_f="8417">; Beck, Rush, Shaw, &amp; Emery, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9"><offsets xml_i="12696" xml_f="12700" txt_i="8417" txt_f="8421">1979</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12707" xml_f="12931" txt_i="8421" txt_f="8641">). Moreover, enhancing state mood with adults by providing them with experimentally manipulated favorable evaluations has been shown to increase levels of subsequent positive feedback seeking (Mischel, Ebbesen, &amp; Zeiss, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30"><offsets xml_i="12964" xml_f="12968" txt_i="8641" txt_f="8645">1973</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12975" xml_f="12977" txt_i="8645" txt_f="8647">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12984" xml_f="13315" txt_i="8648" txt_f="8979">A second limitation of the Casssidy et al. study is that the valence of the evaluative feedback was not manipulated. Beck has asserted that depressed people seek unfavourable feedback only insofar as their negative self-views have been activated by a stressful negative event. Work conducted by Swann and colleagues (Swann et al., </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46"><offsets xml_i="13348" xml_f="13352" txt_i="8979" txt_f="8983">1992</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13359" xml_f="13856" txt_i="8983" txt_f="9480">) has shown that adults high in depressive symptoms respond quite differently with respect to their feedback preferences in the face of positive, negative, or neutral evaluations. Specifically, these individuals responded to positive—i.e., self-discrepant—evaluations with a more pronounced preference for negatively tuned feedback, relative to a control condition; whereas they were not more inclined to seek negative feedback subsequent to receiving unfavorable—i.e., self-congruent—evaluations.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13863" xml_f="14319" txt_i="9481" txt_f="9937">The present study examined the linkage in pre-adolescent children between depressive symptoms and feedback preferences, in response to a salient and ego-involving emotion-eliciting event. Specifically, we examined these linkages in response to both a positive and a negative peer evaluation outcome.

In brief, participants were led to believe that they were playing an Internet version of Survivor against four same-sex contestants of comparable age (all of them were computerized bogus contestants) from four different schools in the same area. They were informed that a team of 16 same-age peer judges consisting of eight boys and eight girls would evaluate all participants. Specifically, each juror would give them a score between 0 and 100, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of perceived likeability. Moreover, the jurors would indicate what they liked most and what they disliked most about each contestant. Participants were randomized to one of the following three peer evaluation feedback conditions: (a) success feedback (i.e., having obtained the highest total score), (b) failure feedback (i.e., having obtained the lowest total score), or (c) control feedback (i.e., having obtained neither the highest nor the lowest score). These feedback conditions were designed to induce mood improvement, mood worsening, and no mood change, respectively. Subsequent to receiving the bogus peer evaluation feedback outcome, children’s feedback preferences were assessed. The assessment of state mood at pre- and post-feedback afforded the possibility to examine the linkages between participants’ level of depressive symptoms, feedback valence, (changes in) state mood, and subsequent feedback preferences.

(b) Are the effects of feedback valence moderated by children’s level of depressive symptoms?

We also hypothesized that level of depressive symptoms would qualify the relationship between our peer feedback manipulation and children’s subsequent feedback preferences, such that children higher on depressive symptoms would be more likely to respond to positive—i.e., self-discrepant—evaluations with a preference for negatively tuned feedback, relative to the control condition. Finally, we hypothesized that the effects of the peer feedback manipulation on subsequent feedback preferences would be mediated by changes in state mood from pre- to post-feedback.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="19303" xml_f="19309" txt_i="14374" txt_f="14380">Method</offsets></title><sec id="Sec3"><title><offsets xml_i="19339" xml_f="19351" txt_i="14381" txt_f="14393">Participants</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19362" xml_f="19584" txt_i="14394" txt_f="14616">Participants were 142 children (73 boys, 69 girls) enrolled in 5th and 6th grade classes from two public elementary schools in the Netherlands.

The second session was carried out in a quiet room on the school grounds.

Prior to beginning (Time 1), participants completed a computer-administered baseline mood measure, i.e., a one-item mood scale ranging from 1 (extremely negative) to 10 (extremely positive). In an attempt to add both to the credibility and the attractiveness of the contest, the opening bars of the hit ‘Survivor’ (produced by the band “Destiny’s Child”) were played at the start of the game.

Participants were informed that they would be playing against four same-sex contestants of comparable age (all of them were computerized fictitious co-players) from four different schools in the same area, and that all participants would be evaluated by a jury consisting of 16 members, eight boys and eight girls.

Following the viewing of these children, participants were directed through a series of screens in which they were asked to answer a series of questions that would give the members of the jury and the other contestants information about them. Participants responded to questions about their favorite musical group, hobbies, future occupation, things they liked and disliked about themselves, a number of character traits (e.g., sense of humor, agreeableness, intelligence, trustworthiness), how they got along with other children, and their academic performance. Most of the questions were in a multiple-choice format but some (e.g., “what is your favorite musical group?”) required an open-ended response. In view of the potential risk that children would respond to personal questions in a socially desirable fashion, instructions emphasized the importance of responding to questions honestly. To further minimize response bias, most questions were worded such that the “best” or “optimal” answer was unclear (e.g., “what is your favorite leisure activity”?). Participants were informed on screen that their picture (previously taken by a web camera) along with the biographical information from their answers to the personal questions would be transmitted over the Internet and viewed by the judges who would then give them a ‘likeability’ score ranging from 0 to 100. Moreover, children were informed that the judges would also indicate what they liked most and what they disliked most of each participant (e.g., “(s)he doesn’t seem to be a nice person,” “(s)he is witty,” “(s)he is unattractive,” “(s)he seems fun to hang out with”).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25415" xml_f="26321" txt_i="20163" txt_f="21069">Subsequent to answering all the biographical questions, participants were informed that pictures and descriptions of each of the other contestants would be presented one-at-a-time for review. Upon clicking “continue,” the picture of the first bogus co-player was displayed together with his or her self-description. The latter consisted of the alleged answers to the same questions that the participant had answered earlier. To enhance credibility of the bogus co-players, actual self-descriptions were taken from those of same-age children participating in another study.

During the debriefing, the child was informed that the judges, the co-players and the received feedback were entirely fictitious and that this deception was a necessary part of the procedure. At this point it should be noted that in our previous work, more than 100 participants were assigned to receive Survivor-administered peer rejection feedback (Reijntjes et al., </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37"><offsets xml_i="28647" xml_f="28651" txt_i="23208" txt_f="23212">2006</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="28658" xml_f="29599" txt_i="23212" txt_f="24153">), including children with elevated depressive symptoms. Interviews with all participants, both immediately post-feedback as well as at one-week follow-up, indicated that the peer failure experience was not too emotionally upsetting. For instance, when asked, none of the participants made mention of any feelings of regret with regard to participation and none reported any objections to the procedure. On the contrary, several children—spontaneously—reported to consider the rejection experience an unnerving but useful experience, for themselves and/or their peers. Still, during the investigation a registered clinical psychologist was available when needed. Moreover, before being dismissed children were interviewed at length about a recent positive social experience in which they felt positive and/or were successful. In so doing, we aimed to maximize the remedy for children showing a strong emotional response to the peer feedback.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29606" xml_f="30674" txt_i="24154" txt_f="25222">Towards the end of the debriefing, participants were encouraged to ask questions or voice their concerns.

The credibility of the deception manipulation was also assessed during the debriefing by asking each participant whether they had believed that they were playing against other children. With no exception, participants indicated that they believed that the game was genuine. Finally, all participants reported that prior to participating they had not talked with classmates about Survivor. At the conclusion of the debriefing, participants were urged to observe complete secrecy by not talking with their classmates about Survivor until all the other children had participated. To increase adherence to this instruction, children were asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement and were then provided a choice of one of several possible small gifts for playing the game (e.g., a small tape recorder, a gift certificate worth about 3 dollars).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title><offsets xml_i="30706" xml_f="30714" txt_i="25224" txt_f="25232">Measures</offsets></title><sec id="Sec8"><title><offsets xml_i="30744" xml_f="30754" txt_i="25233" txt_f="25243">State mood</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="30765" xml_f="30864" txt_i="25244" txt_f="25339">Similar to previous work among children (Reijntjes, Stegge, Meerum Terwogt, Kamphuis, &amp; Telch, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37"><offsets xml_i="30897" xml_f="30901" txt_i="25339" txt_f="25343">2006</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30908" xml_f="30935" txt_i="25343" txt_f="25370">) and adults (e.g., Gross, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19"><offsets xml_i="30968" xml_f="30972" txt_i="25370" txt_f="25374">1998</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30979" xml_f="31320" txt_i="25374" txt_f="25715">), children rated their current feeling state using a one-item global mood index, ranging from 1 (extremely negative) to 10 (extremely positive).

In the first planned contrast, state mood scores at Time 1 and Time 2 served as the dependent variables. Condition (Success vs. Neutral feedback) served as the between subjects factor, and Assessment phase (Pre-feedback vs. Post-feedback) served as the within subject repeated measures factor. Interaction effects were followed up with simple main effects analyses, comparing Time 1 vs. Time 2 scores for each feedback condition separately.

In so doing, we included both a positive and a negative peer feedback manipulation, along with the assessment of the roles of state mood at baseline, changes in affect from pre- to post-feedback, and actual standing in the peer group. Data on participants’ immediate changes in state mood in response to the feedback manipulation revealed that the Survivor contest was successful in eliciting differential affective reactions in the expected direction as a function of feedback valence. Moreover, our debriefing interviews revealed that children were involved in the activity and that none of the participants reported being aware that the feedback they received was bogus.

One possible explanation may involve the (single and joint) effects of differences in the domain of feedback seeking, the age of the participants, and the specific measures that were employed. For instance, Mischel et al. (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30"><offsets xml_i="51914" xml_f="51918" txt_i="41661" txt_f="41665">1973</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="51925" xml_f="52744" txt_i="41665" txt_f="42484">) provided adult participants with feedback on an intellectual task, and observed that a favorable feedback outcome increased subsequent positive feedback seeking; whereas in the present study pre-adolescent children received feedback on a social task. Another explanation may be that our manipulated peer evaluation outcome differs from the types of manipulations used in other studies examining feedback preferences. It may be that the manipulation employed in the present study may have been more personally relevant (i.e., ego-involving), and hence elicited a different pattern of feedback preferences relative to exposure to less personally relevant feedback (e.g., impressions evaluators had allegedly formed on the basis of participants’ displayed nonverbal behavior while delivering a speech; see Swann et al., </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46"><offsets xml_i="52777" xml_f="52781" txt_i="42484" txt_f="42488">1992</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="52788" xml_f="53268" txt_i="42488" txt_f="42968">). Specifically, it seems likely that participants in the present study were more concerned and/or distressed after being rejected based on their personal and physical attributes, relative to participants receiving a negative evaluation based on their non-verbal behavior. Consequently, they may have displayed an increased interest in (preference for) negative feedback, which might be considered more diagnostic and informative on learning why the judges viewed them negatively.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="53275" xml_f="53602" txt_i="42969" txt_f="43296">Our findings on the linkages between the valence of the manipulated feedback outcome and subsequent feedback preferences were not consistent with previous work among adults.

Specifically, in the present study the predictive role of depressive symptoms on subsequent feedback preferences emerged only for children in the negative feedback condition, such that children with higher levels of depressive symptoms displayed a significantly stronger preference for negative feedback.

Interestingly, across conditions we found that children’s actual standing in the peer group was not associated with feedback preferences. In this context, it should be noted that in the Joiner et al.

Second, because all significant results are based on children’s self-report, it is possible that our findings are partly due to shared method variance. Third, our findings are based on a community sample of children, rather than a clinical sample with a diagnosed mood disorder. Children’s mean scores on the CDI suggest that depressive symptoms were relatively modest in magnitude. It is therefore an empirical question to what extent our findings can be generalized to children who meet criteria for major depressive disorder. Finally, this investigation focused only on children’s feedback preferences in response to peer evaluation.
