Here, we assessed the efficacy and safety of IVIG therapy with polyethylene glycol-treated human IgG (drug code GB-0998) for patients with corticosteroid-refractory polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) by means of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We randomly assigned 26 subjects (16 PM and 10 DM) to receive either GB-0998 or placebo. Intragroup comparison in the GB-0998 group showed statistically significant improvements due to GB-0998 administration in the primary endpoint (manual muscle test score) and secondary endpoints (serum creatine kinase level and activities of daily living score). However, significant improvements were also found in the placebo group, and comparison of the GB-0998 group with the placebo group did not show any significant difference between the groups. We discuss possible reasons for the absence of a clear intergroup difference in efficacy. Nineteen adverse drug reactions were observed in 11 of 26 subjects (42.3%), of which 2 events (decreased muscle strength and increased serum creatine kinase) were assessed as serious; however, they are previously known events. These results indicate that GB-0998 can be safely used with the same precautions as other current IVIG therapy.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)</kwd><kwd>Manual muscle test (MMT)</kwd><kwd>Polymyositis (PM)</kwd><kwd>Dermatomyositis (DM)</kwd><kwd>Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© Japan College of Rheumatology 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title><offsets xml_i="5854" xml_f="5866" txt_i="1401" txt_f="1413">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5877" xml_f="6349" txt_i="1414" txt_f="1886">Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are diffuse inflammatory myopathies of unknown etiology, causing decreased strength in the limb proximal group muscles, cervical muscles, and pharyngeal muscles, and have been designated as targets for disease treatment research by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.

After an assessment duration of 8 weeks from the start of administration (the first period), subjects receiving the active drug were switched to receive the placebo in the second period, whereas those receiving the placebo in the first period were switched to receive the active drug in the second period. The assessment duration in the second period was 8 weeks, and there was an additional 4-week observation period (follow-up period) after the second period. Because of the seriousness of the disease, the second period was included in the study design to enable all subjects in the study to receive GB-0998. For ethical reasons, patients who did not show disease alleviation within 4 weeks after the start of the first period, rendering continuation of the study difficult, were given an early transition to the second period; i.e., these subjects were transferred to the second period without continuing in the first period for the full 8 weeks. For this reason, the primary evaluation was of efficacy in the first period.</offsets><fig id="Fig1"><label><offsets xml_i="9465" xml_f="9471" txt_i="4753" txt_f="4759">Fig. 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="9491" xml_f="9762" txt_i="4759" txt_f="5030">Outline of study design.

In order to clarify the reasons for this, we tried to identify features of the subjects’ backgrounds that might have led to significant improvement being achieved even with placebo administration.

When these 7 subjects were excluded, an intergroup comparison of MMT scores during the first period among the other 19 subjects, who underwent either no change or deterioration during the prestudy run-in period, gave an increased intergroup difference, 3.8, with a 95% confidence interval of −4.4 to 11.9, although this is still not statistically significant.

It will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy in accordance with the methods used in clinical studies, in order to assure comparability with the clinical study results.
