The program comprised enhanced administrative services rather than new benefits. SLM was also crafted to be patient-centric (in which one manager would develop a relationship with the member), rather than disease-specific (in which a member would be directed to multiple managers for different problems and disease states).

This electronic record integrated historical medical claims, daily updates of current medical claims data, monthly updates of laboratory test results and prescription information, and data from assessments of members' health through a survey and regularly scheduled phone calls. The Master Console was developed with a Visual Basic client, which allowed rapid prototyping, revision based on end-user feedback, and deployment of upgrades. No physician-based medical records were part of Master Console. Decision support algorithms built into the Master Console alerted program staff to potential changes in the clinical status of a patient, need for case management screening (actual assignment to case management being at the judgment of the nurse care coordinator [NCC] based at the HMO), or the potential need for a service intervention. For example, authorization of a joint replacement procedure would trigger a task/reminder for an outbound phone call by a registered NCC the following day to determine anticipated therapy needs in addition to a prompt to perform both a home-safety assessment and a falls-risk assessment. As another example, the filling of a prescription for flurazepam would trigger a fax to the prescribing physician about the relative contraindication of long-acting benzodiazepines in the elderly and asking for reconsideration of this therapeutic maneuver.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11848" xml_f="12027" txt_i="7433" txt_f="7612">Prior to initiating SLM, 72% of the 8504 study participants completed either 1) a mailed health assessment  (the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]) (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="12059" xml_f="12061" txt_i="7612" txt_f="7614">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12068" xml_f="12474" txt_i="7614" txt_f="8020">) along with satisfaction questions from the Medicare Beneficiary Survey or 2) follow-up telephone surveys if they had not returned their mail-in form.

A team consisted of an NCC, who supervised two personal service representatives (PSRs). The PSR was a new level of staffing created specifically for this intervention. PSRs were not required to have clinical training but were selected based on communication skills and sensitivity to geriatric issues as ascertained by interviews with experienced nurse clinicians. PSRs were provided with eight weeks of intensive training consisting of didactic sessions covering common geriatric issues, in addition to direct critiquing and refinement of telephone communication skills by allowing trainees to handle customer service calls in tandem with supervisors. After training, PSRs handled outbound phone contacts and performed periodic health screenings with scripted questionnaires. The NCC was responsible for outbound contact to all those in complex case management (50 to 70 participants per team), communicating with treating physicians and office staff, following up on hospitalizations and ER visits, and arranging for home health care and durable equipment through the primary care physician.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13671" xml_f="14142" txt_i="9205" txt_f="9676">A full-time medical director, administrator, and social worker also staffed the SLM program.

At least every three months, PSRs contacted all members in the intervention group not currently in case management to perform an 18-question short assessment. This questionnaire was designed to probe for significant changes in physical health, mental health, or social supports. Questions dealt with such domains as stresses and losses, falls, pain, changes in activities of daily living, incontinence, nutrition, and mood. Logic built into the short assessment triggered further evaluation by other clinicians. For example, report of a fall would trigger a home safety assessment, whereas loss of a loved one or pet would trigger a depression evaluation by the social worker. PSRs also fulfilled a customer service role, fielding inbound calls from members. This provided an opportunity to probe further for changes in health status.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15146" xml_f="15918" txt_i="10668" txt_f="11440">Disease management modules were developed for congestive heart failure, falls (home safety), nutrition, depression, and diabetes mellitus. These conditions were chosen because they were prevalent, contributed to morbidity, and were deemed actionable. Based upon decision support algorithms, targeted educational materials (selected by program staff and purchased from Channing Bete Corporation, South Deerfield, Mass) were sent to members. PSRs made follow-up phone calls within two weeks of patient receipt of such materials. During phone contact, patients might be referred to a range of care providers, including primary care physicians or mental health providers, or connected to community services, such as Meals On Wheels, transportation services, or adult day care.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="15940" xml_f="15952" txt_i="11442" txt_f="11454">Study design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="15963" xml_f="16755" txt_i="11455" txt_f="12247">This model was tested as a randomized controlled prospective open trial.

Demonstrating population-level changes with the interventions described is challenging, because large changes in a small number of individuals are diluted, and differences are often obscured by year-to-year variation. The short 18-month intervention period for this study compounded the challenge of demonstrating improved health outcomes and cost savings.

Measures of health status and satisfaction relied on self-reporting, and the study was conducted as an open trial. Another possible weakness was that primary care physicians caring for patients in this study were reimbursed under a capitation model. Thus, there was a financial disincentive for providers to see patients more frequently in the office to address concerns raised by case managers. Under a fee-for-service model, physicians might have been more motivated to see patients early and more frequently to address concerns disclosed by case mangers. While this might have helped avoid costly hospital admissions, the more frequent visits would themselves drive up costs, thereby making the cost-offset analysis less favorable.
