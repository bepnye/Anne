The study recruited primarily in secondary care through community mental health teams and psychiatrists with a smaller number of participants recruited through primary care. Recruitment opened in October 2015 and closed in December 2016, by which point 526 participants had been recruited.

Cooperating with clinicians and supporting them to feel confident and involved with the SCIMITAR+ study was key in the recruitment strategy for this trial. Identifying and building a network of professionals with enthusiasm for research played a crucial role. Multiple methods were used to support this, including: establishing research champions within clinical teams; building relationships with individual professionals in potential recruitment areas; and initiating conversations between clinicians and researchers about the trial. Displaying and developing enthusiasm for SCIMITAR+ and the potential positive outcomes that could be gained through engagement in the trial was an important part of these discussions. Such actions fostered good relationships with clinicians and enabled access to potential participants.</offsets></p><p id="Par23"><offsets xml_i="21056" xml_f="22012" txt_i="10004" txt_f="10960">In many sites, researchers were embedded into mental health teams who focused on engaging that team and promoting study participation. This ranged from a full-time commitment through to spending time on wards and units interacting with staff and patients informally (achieved with the service support costs â from the local Comprehensive Research Network [CRN]). Initially, this allowed the researchers to identify how recruitment would function best within that team, e.g. where to place advertisements so that they were most likely to be read. As the study continued, the presence of the researcher served as a regular reminder of SCIMITAR+ and meant that the clinical team had a recognised contact for the study to whom they could direct questions and any participant referrals. Informal conversations aided with networking, and gave the potential for discussions about SCIMITAR+, to identify team members who were interested in supporting the research.</offsets></p><p id="Par24"><offsets xml_i="22030" xml_f="23105" txt_i="10961" txt_f="12036">A wholehearted approach to recruitment seemed to be most effective in two areas. First, where the researcher could speak directly with potential participants, e.g. when potential participants attended a clinic for a routine long-acting injection, a motivated clinician actively identifying potential participants and discussing SCIMITAR+ with them, particularly where the participant had a trusting relationship with the clinician, had a positive effect on recruitment. People recruited in this way appeared more engaged and genuinely interested in the trial and were more likely to seek further information. Second, it was particularly useful when the person promoting the trial was the Principal Investigator or was in a position to influence other clinicians to encourage engagement. Most notably, it was identified that interaction with researchers could provide both individual clinicians and teams with evidence that they were meeting their professional responsibilities in relation to research. These include the responsibilities outlined within the NHS constitution [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25"><offsets xml_i="23138" xml_f="23140" txt_i="12036" txt_f="12038">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23147" xml_f="23320" txt_i="12038" txt_f="12211">], i.e. supporting access to pertinent research projects, developing evidence-based practice and enabling patients to make informed decisions about their care and treatment.</offsets></p><p id="Par25"><offsets xml_i="23338" xml_f="23937" txt_i="12212" txt_f="12811">Researchers also supported clinicians with recruitment during outpatient clinics, such as clozapine and depot clinics. Initially, study staff would remind the clinicians of the details and eligibility criteria of the study so that they felt confident in making referrals. Researchers would then either sit in the clinic room to speak directly to patients or wait in a separate room for patients to be referred to them after their appointment. Primary care services were also recognised as potential settings for recruitment and would-be avenues worthy of consideration in future trials as necessary.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title><offsets xml_i="23975" xml_f="23994" txt_i="12814" txt_f="12833">Engaging with sites</offsets></title><p id="Par26"><offsets xml_i="24016" xml_f="24843" txt_i="12834" txt_f="13661">The trial management team (trial manager and trial coordinators) worked to ensure that all procedures were as straightforward as possible, particularly in relation to study recruitment. The burden on recruiters was minimised by providing recruitment packs containing all the necessary materials required for recruitment and ensuring that the trial materials were attractive, clear and easy to understand to both recruitment sites and potential participants. Frequent meetings were held between the studyâs trial management team and recruiting sites, with the aim of sharing effective strategies, answering queries and supporting sites that were experiencing difficulties with recruitment. The trial management team aimed to establish a supportive culture by responding to queries promptly and taking time to listen to concerns.</offsets></p><p id="Par27"><offsets xml_i="24861" xml_f="25273" txt_i="13662" txt_f="14074">The opening of sites was phased with a small number of sites opening initially so that any problems with recruitment procedures could be discussed and rectified early in the process before additional sites joined.

The majority of sites gave presentations to mental health teams at the beginning of the study, summarising the key aims, benefits and eligibility criteria of SCIMITAR+. This ensured that clinical staff understood the study and how they could help with recruitment. In many cases, researchers continued to attend team meetings to give updates and promote engagement with the study, thus establishing SCIMITAR+ as an important part of the teamâs work. Meetings also provided a forum for addressing the barriers, questions and concerns identified by clinicians, and were a chance for researchers to offer practical support.</offsets></p><p id="Par30"><offsets xml_i="26720" xml_f="27638" txt_i="15436" txt_f="16354">In addition, researchers used the relationships they had established with clinicians to work with them on a one-to-one level. Primarily, this involved screening caseloads for eligible participants. Researchers could then arrange with clinicians to attend their next meeting with the potential participant (with permission) in order to discuss the study in person. Clinicians reported that they felt more supported with this approach, as the researcher is better equipped to speak about the details of the trial and answer any questions the participant may have. This is particularly useful in services in which several research studies are running concurrently, as clinicians may find it difficult to talk confidently about each. Speaking with clinicians individually also allowed researchers to highlight the benefits for clinicians of assisting with research, e.g. building their professional development portfolios.</offsets></p><p id="Par31"><offsets xml_i="27656" xml_f="28552" txt_i="16355" txt_f="17251">Developing links with local health screening clinics at an early stage in recruitment was also beneficial. Potential trial participants were identified by clinic staff and the option of referral to SCIMITAR+ was discussed during smoking cessation conversations. The CQUIN targets further encouraged clinicians to ask every patient whether they smoked during routine care appointments. This prompted a conversation about smoking cessation and the opportunity to participate in SCIMITAR+, thus increasing recruitment to the trial with minimal impact on the routine work of the clinicians while maintaining a mutually supportive relationship with the research team. We had also hoped that the UKâs Stoptober initiative would generate increased interest in the trial around this time, but did not find this. Future trials could consider how best to take advantage of relevant promotions such as this.</offsets></p><p id="Par32"><offsets xml_i="28570" xml_f="29118" txt_i="17252" txt_f="17800">One particularly successful partnership involved a new unit dedicated to integrating the physical and mental healthcare of people with psychosis. The service had a target to support smokers to quit so the unit was able to promote SCIMITAR+ to patients which in turn helped the service to meet their smoking cessation target.

Three key factors were identified to be important in increasing recruitment to both SCIMITAR+ and for future RCTs: cliniciansâ attitudes; inter-professional working; and utilising NHS targets.

While recruitment to RCTs can benefit from targeted involvement of clinicians with an interest in the study topic, further work through the life course of a trial is necessary to build and maintain relationships that sustain interest and enthusiasm among the research staff.

Where clinicians are already invested in the research project, it is prudent to utilise this presence and enthusiasm to facilitate study presence and to engage members of the wider clinical team. Development of these relationships would assist in enhancing interest and investment in research activity and may therefore result in increased recruitment activity in both current and future projects. It is important to note that the SCIMITAR+ trial is a non-commercial trial conducted within the NHS. There were therefore no financial incentives for clinicians to recruit which could lead to a conflict of interest. In studies where such a conflict could arise, it would be essential to implement strategies to mitigate against such conflicts.</offsets></p><p id="Par35"><offsets xml_i="31516" xml_f="31724" txt_i="19990" txt_f="20198">The impact of research responsibilities on clinical teams continues to be a barrier to recruitment, with many clinicians reporting that clinical workloads mean they struggle to accommodate research activity [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6"><offsets xml_i="31756" xml_f="31757" txt_i="20198" txt_f="20199">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31764" xml_f="31766" txt_i="20199" txt_f="20201">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27"><offsets xml_i="31799" xml_f="31801" txt_i="20201" txt_f="20203">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31808" xml_f="32296" txt_i="20203" txt_f="20691">].

Future RCTs should therefore consider from the outset how best to utilise dedicated research staff to support clinical teams with recruitment activity, to ensure a targeted approach appropriate to the setting.
