An independent physician will be appointed to whom patients can turn if they have any questions, etc. Written consent will be asked prior to participation. All data will be collected by a research assistant and will be stored in a database. The data will be anonymised and coded so third parties will not be able to link data to specific patients, thus ensuring complete confidentiality of data of individual patients.
