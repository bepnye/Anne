In the MOBILE trial, the sample size estimation was based on the primary outcome, which was the cumulative morphine consumption at 72 hours postsurgery. Therefore, with a sample size of 101, there may have been a lack of power to detect a difference between the two groups even if a true difference exists.

The study results suggest that ANCOVA is a statistically efficient method of analyzing data of this nature and also, that the use of change and percent change scores should be employed with caution since the statistical power of these methods is highly dependent on the correlation between the baseline and the outcome. Although the findings of this study can be limited to only trials with no correlation between the adjustment variables, it should be noted that the study does contribute to the growing body of evidence on this subject, where ANCOVA has been shown as the method with the most advantages. A number of future studies should be conducted to strengthen the interpretation of this study. Simulation studies with a correlation of baseline and outcome lower than 0.2 can contribute to the evaluation of the conclusion of this study. Moreover, empirical data that were intended as the primary outcome of the study should be used in order to ensure the validity of this analysis.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37981" xml_f="38091" txt_i="28145" txt_f="28255">Future studies may look at logistic regression and how the method of covariate adjustment affects the results.</offsets><xref rid="b26-clep-6-227" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="38134" xml_f="38136" txt_i="28255" txt_f="28257">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38143" xml_f="38692" txt_i="28257" txt_f="28806"> For instance, it is known that when the covariate included in the trial is that of a binary or survival nature, the adjustment methodology and implications are completely different. The omission of a balanced covariate has dramatic effects on the estimate of treatment effect, and this effect is magnified when a highly prognostic covariate is included in the analysis. Investigating some of these scenarios and developing a complete empirical study based on the various baseline adjustment methods set out in this study would be of great interest.</offsets><xref rid="b9-clep-6-227" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="38734" xml_f="38735" txt_i="28806" txt_f="28807">9</offsets></xref></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>LT, JP, MNA, and SZ conceived the idea and designed the study; SZ, LT, JP, MNA, NB, US, JC, JD, MW, DW, DP and VA contributed to analysis and interpretation of data.
