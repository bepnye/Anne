In the needle injection group, after successful loss of resistance with saline was obtained, a 10 mL loading dose of 0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 µg/mL was given in 5 mL increments via the epidural needle spaced 2 minutes apart. Between doses, the patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms suggestive of IT or IV injection were carefully observed. In order to maintain blinding for the study, anesthesia providers stood behind the patients in the catheter injection group during this time but did not inject any epidural medication. In both study groups, the epidural catheter was then advanced and catheter aspiration performed. If the anesthesia provider was unable to readily advance the catheter in a timely manner or the catheter aspiration was positive for blood or cerebrospinal fluid, then the patient would not continue in the study and their subsequent care would be at the discretion of the anesthesia provider. Five minutes after loss of resistance, the catheter injection group then received the same 10 mL loading dose of 0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 µg/mL, given in 5 mL increments via the epidural catheter spaced 2 minutes apart. In order to once again maintain patient and investigator blinding, the anesthesia providers stood behind the patients in the needle injection group during this time without giving any epidural medication. It should be noted that the catheter dose was administered 5 minutes after the needle group to ensure that equal timing of VRS pain score and sensory blockade level assessments after medication injection would occur with both study groups, as these parameters were recorded at baseline and thereafter at 5-minute intervals. Three minutes after the last epidural catheter dose was given (or not given for patients in the needle injection group), both study groups received an epidural test dose of 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 3 mL to look for signs of IV or IT catheter placement. The epidural catheter test dose is usually administered prior to giving other medications through the epidural catheter, though for the purposes of this investigation, it was determined that the same epidural medications should be administered in the same order to enable more equal comparison of onset of pain relief and sensory blockade measured from the time of injection between study groups. Further, careful patient observation, catheter aspiration, and incremental dosing were determined to be reasonable safeguards against IV or IT administration of medication. All patients then received a standard epidural infusion of 0.0625% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 µg/mL at 10 mL/h with patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) 10 mL doses, 20-minute lockout.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17442" xml_f="18853" txt_i="12140" txt_f="13551">Participants were asked to rate the pain of their most recent uterine contraction on a VRS of 0–10 every 5 minutes (0=no pain, 10=worst pain imaginable) for 20 minutes beginning at the time loss of resistance occurred and just prior to the first potential dose of local anesthetic through the epidural needle. The sensory level was determined by loss of sharpness to pinprick with a blunt tip needle recorded every 5 minutes for 20 minutes after loss of resistance location of the epidural space. Primary outcome measures used to compare the epidural needle- and epidural catheter-based loading techniques included rates of analgesic (VRS/minute) and sensory blockade onset (sensory level/minute). Time to VRS ≤3 was also recorded for both groups. Maternal heart rate, fetal heart rate, and maternal blood pressure measurements were used to assess the safety profiles between study groups and were recorded every 2 minutes for 20 minutes after successful location of the epidural space. Occurrence of adverse events, such as accidental IV or IT injection of medications, was recorded. The number of PCEA demand doses and the total volume of anesthetic infused were used as metrics to assess the effectiveness of analgesia throughout the duration of labor, and these parameters were recorded after delivery.

Instead, it may have been beneficial to measure analgesic onset from the time of epidural space location rather than from the time of injection, as this may have demonstrated a benefit in terms of shortening onset of pain relief after needle injection. Measuring analgesic onset from the time of successful location of the epidural space is also arguably a better reflection of actual clinical practice, as needle injection can be performed prior to catheter insertion, aspiration, test dosing, catheter securing, and eventual catheter dosing. Importantly, the incidence of side effects was also observed to be similar between study groups, as no statistically significant differences in maternal mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, or incidence of fetal bradycardia were observed.
