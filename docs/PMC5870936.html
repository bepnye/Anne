However, PSB is a complex behaviour with many barriers reported by parents hindering its effective implementation. Within the UK, oral health advice is delivered universally to parents by health visitors and their wider teams when children are aged between 9 and 12 months. Nevertheless, there is no standardised intervention or training upon which health visitors can base this advice, and they often lack the specialised knowledge needed to help parents overcome barriers to performing PSB and limiting sugary foods and drinks.</offsets></p><p id="Par2"><offsets xml_i="7917" xml_f="8263" txt_i="720" txt_f="1066">Working with health visitors and parents of children aged 9–24 months, we have co-designed oral health training and resources (Health Visitors delivering Advice in Britain on Infant Toothbrushing (HABIT) intervention) to be used by health visitors and their wider teams when providing parents of children aged 9–12 months with oral health advice.</offsets></p><p id="Par3"><offsets xml_i="8280" xml_f="8473" txt_i="1067" txt_f="1260">The aim of the study is to explore the acceptability of the HABIT intervention to parents and health visitors, to examine the mechanism of action and develop suitable objective measures of PSB.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8495" xml_f="8509" txt_i="1262" txt_f="1276">Methods/design</offsets></title><p id="Par4"><offsets xml_i="8530" xml_f="9420" txt_i="1277" txt_f="2167">Six health visitors working in a deprived city in the UK will be provided with training on how to use the HABIT intervention. Health visitors will then each deliver the intervention to five parents of children aged 9–12 months. The research team will collect measures of PSB and dietary behaviours before and at 2 weeks and 3 months after the HABIT intervention. Acceptability of the HABIT intervention to health visitors will be explored through semi-structured diaries completed after each visit and a focus group discussion after delivery to all parents. Acceptability of the HABIT intervention and mechanism of action will be explored briefly during each home visit with parents and in greater details in 20–25 qualitative interviews after the completion of data collection. The utility of three objective measures of PSB will be compared with each other and with parental-self reports.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9442" xml_f="9452" txt_i="2169" txt_f="2179">Discussion</offsets></title><p id="Par5"><offsets xml_i="9473" xml_f="9592" txt_i="2180" txt_f="2299">This study will provide essential information to inform the design of a definitive cluster randomised controlled trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9614" xml_f="9632" txt_i="2301" txt_f="2319">Trial registration</offsets></title><p id="Par6"><offsets xml_i="9653" xml_f="9711" txt_i="2320" txt_f="2378">There is no database for early phase studies such as ours.</offsets></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Parental supervised brushing</kwd><kwd>Caries</kwd><kwd>Children aged 9–12 months</kwd><kwd>Parents</kwd><kwd>Health visitors</kwd><kwd>Diet</kwd><kwd>Oral health advice</kwd><kwd>HABIT intervention</kwd><kwd>Behaviour change</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P017185/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title><offsets xml_i="10674" xml_f="10684" txt_i="2387" txt_f="2397">Background</offsets></title><p id="Par15"><offsets xml_i="10706" xml_f="10822" txt_i="2398" txt_f="2514">Dental caries (tooth decay) is the most prevalent preventable childhood disease and a major public health priority [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1"><offsets xml_i="10854" xml_f="10855" txt_i="2514" txt_f="2515">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10862" xml_f="10864" txt_i="2515" txt_f="2517">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2"><offsets xml_i="10896" xml_f="10897" txt_i="2517" txt_f="2518">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10904" xml_f="11071" txt_i="2518" txt_f="2685">].
