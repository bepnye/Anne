This pilot trial aimed to identify any potential benefits of family-based Johrei practice in childhood eczema and for general health and to establish the feasibility of a subsequent randomised controlled trial. Volunteer families of 3-5 individuals, including at least one child with eczema were recruited to an uncontrolled pilot trial lasting 12 months. Parents were trained in Johrei healing and then practised at home with their family. Participants kept diaries and provided questionnaire data at baseline, 3,6 and 12 months. Eczema symptoms were scored at the same intervals. Scepticism about Johrei is presently an obstacle to recruitment and retention of a representative sample in a clinical trial, and to its potential use in general practice. The frequency and quality of practise at home by families may be insufficient to bring about the putative health benefits. Initial improvements in eczema symptoms and diary recorded illness, could not be separated from seasonal factors and other potential confounders. There were no improvements on other outcomes measuring general health and psychological wellbeing of family members.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Johrei</kwd><kwd>spiritual healing</kwd><kwd>eczema</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4598" xml_f="4610" txt_i="1321" txt_f="1333">Introduction</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4630" xml_f="4667" txt_i="1334" txt_f="1371">Johrei is a Form of Spiritual Healing</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4678" xml_f="5201" txt_i="1372" txt_f="1895">Johrei healing, originated in Japan, is a form of spiritual healing comprising ‘energy channelling’ and light massage. The latter incorporates elements of Reiki and acupressure. Energy channelling is the direction of an intangible healing energy through the hands of the healer at a distance from the person receiving healing. Practitioners differ in the emphasis given to these two components. Johrei can be learned and practised by anyone and is seen as a two-way process that heals both the healer and the person healed.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5208" xml_f="5508" txt_i="1896" txt_f="2196">Johrei is practised within some Japanese families and, anecdotally, such families are healthier and use less medication than those who do not practise Johrei.

The effects of Johrei on childhood eczema specifically as well as upon general family health were considered because of favorable anecdotal reports in this condition, and because it was thought desirable to include at least one condition common to all the families which could be assessed using a standardized symptom score. A year-long pilot study was initiated because practitioners insisted that the benefits of Johrei would only manifest with long-term, regular practice. If this is the case then the issues of retention and long-term compliance are also important in assessing the practical application of Johrei self-healing as a health care strategy.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="7103" xml_f="7109" txt_i="3641" txt_f="3647">Method</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7129" xml_f="7170" txt_i="3648" txt_f="3689">Trial Design, Funding and Ethics Approval</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7181" xml_f="7501" txt_i="3690" txt_f="4010">The study was a prospective, single-center, uncontrolled pilot trial with a 12 month treatment period.

GP surgeries are primary care facilities provided throughout the UK as part of the National Health Service. We aimed to recruit 20 families, a number which we regarded as achievable within the 2 year time-frame of the study's funding and practical in terms of the logistics and resources available for initial training in Johrei and follow-up sessions. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) Families had to comprise 3–5 individuals living under one roof. (ii) Families had to include at least one child with diagnosed atopic eczema. (iii) Families had to live within 15 miles (later extended to 30 miles) of the study center in Exeter where training sessions were held. (iv) All family members, old enough to do so, had to agree to participate in the trial by learning and practicing Johrei and completing the outcome measures. All family members were required to learn and practice Johrei because it is a mutual process in which one member heals another and practitioners insist that maximum benefits for family health are enjoyed when the whole family participates.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8808" xml_f="8849" txt_i="5267" txt_f="5308">How Families Learned and Practised Johrei</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8860" xml_f="9358" txt_i="5309" txt_f="5807">Representatives from each family were required to attend three group meetings led by a trained Johrei teacher to learn the healing techniques. They were then asked to practise with other family members at home on a regular basis. Families were encouraged to attend monthly group follow-on sessions with the Johrei teacher to review the healing procedure and discuss their experiences. Groups of families were trained in three cohorts and follow-on sessions involved families from all three cohorts.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9380" xml_f="9445" txt_i="5809" txt_f="5874">We Measured Health, Well-being and Eczema Symptoms every 3 Months</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9456" xml_f="9613" txt_i="5875" txt_f="6032">General health and psychological well-being were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months using the validated quality of life questionnaires WHOQOL-BREF (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3"><offsets xml_i="9644" xml_f="9645" txt_i="6032" txt_f="6033">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9652" xml_f="9665" txt_i="6033" txt_f="6046">) and SF-36 (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4"><offsets xml_i="9696" xml_f="9697" txt_i="6046" txt_f="6047">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9704" xml_f="9743" txt_i="6047" txt_f="6086">), the Significant Others Scale (SOS) (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5"><offsets xml_i="9774" xml_f="9775" txt_i="6086" txt_f="6087">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9782" xml_f="9851" txt_i="6087" txt_f="6156">), a measure of social support and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6"><offsets xml_i="9882" xml_f="9883" txt_i="6156" txt_f="6157">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9890" xml_f="10077" txt_i="6157" txt_f="6344">).

The SASSAD scoring was carried out by a Research Assistant trained in its use. Six signs of eczema (erythema, lichenification, excoriation, dryness, cracking and exudation) were scored by physical examination of six areas of the body (head and neck, hands, arms, trunk, feet, and legs). The SASSAD score is the total score for all signs in all areas. The maximum score, corresponding to the most severe eczema, is 108. The CDLQI is a validated questionnaire for children aged 5–16. It comprises 10 questions about the degree to which the child's skin problems have affected various aspects of their daily life including discomfort/pain, embarrassment, friendships, clothing choices, play, sports, schoolwork, teasing/bullying, sleep and treatment. Each answer is scored from 0 to 3 with 3 indicating more of a problem and a maximum score of 30 representing the biggest interference with daily life. Families also kept diaries recording periods of illness, days off work or school and regularity of Johrei practise. Families completing the 12 month trial were interviewed following a structured procedure and medical records were accessed for the year preceeding the trial and the year of the trial itself. The Research Assistant kept in regular telephone contact with all families, reminding them to attend training sessions and monthly follow-on sessions and to return diary data and completed questionnaires. Particular attempts were made to contact and encourage families who appeared to be on the point of dropping out or who were not returning data.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11834" xml_f="11841" txt_i="8000" txt_f="8007">Results</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11861" xml_f="11919" txt_i="8008" txt_f="8066">Recruitment, Retention and Compliance were all Problematic</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11930" xml_f="12573" txt_i="8067" txt_f="8710">Despite several press releases, newspaper advertisements, advertising in GP surgeries and an increase of the initial catchment area from a 15 mile radius around Exeter to a 30 mile radius, recruitment proved difficult.

In particular, the lack of a control group means that any trends observed should be interpreted with great caution. For example, the incidence of illness reported in the family diaries declined, but these data are influenced by the fact that most families started the trial in the autumn or winter months when we would expect illnesses to occur more frequently. It is also inconsistent with the data from GP medical records of the four families completing the trial. Eczema severity appeared to fall during the first 3 months of the trial but again there may be a seasonal effect with symptoms improving during what was for most children enrolled in the trial, the winter months at the start of the trial. Some studies report increased symptom severity associated with the release of pollen during spring (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10"><offsets xml_i="21654" xml_f="21656" txt_i="16913" txt_f="16915">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21663" xml_f="21764" txt_i="16915" txt_f="17016">) while others report worse symptoms in winter associated with low sun exposure and low temperature (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11"><offsets xml_i="21796" xml_f="21798" txt_i="17016" txt_f="17018">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21805" xml_f="22362" txt_i="17018" txt_f="17575">). A specific effect of Johrei on eczema is difficult to reconcile with the fact that several families dropped out at 3 months despite this apparent improvement. Even among the families who completed the trial, most were reluctant to say unequivocally that there had been a marked effect on their child's eczema, or that any effect seen was due to Johrei. An optimistic interpretation would be that the improvement in symptoms during the first 3 months led to the withdrawals at this stage but this is not mentioned among the reasons given for withdrawing (</offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><offsets xml_i="22396" xml_f="22403" txt_i="17575" txt_f="17582">Table 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22410" xml_f="22791" txt_i="17582" txt_f="17963">). Correlation coefficients describing the relationship between number of Johrei sessions in the first 3 months and change in eczema symptom scores were not statistically significant when considering either practise sessions specifically with the child or those practised by the whole family.

The CDQLI data available for three children also showed an improvement during the first 3 months but this observation is subject to the same reservations arising from the lack of a control group.

There were two main reasons for this. Either a family member, usually the husband, did not find the idea of Johrei acceptable or the time commitment required to learn and practice Johrei on a regular basis was too great. It appears that Johrei healing is not easily acceptable in the UK. The idea of spiritual healing arouses scepticism and suspicion, particularly among men. The main reason that families agreed to participate was because they were desperate to try anything which might help their child's eczema. Families frequently cited the husband's work schedule as being incompatible with regular practice of Johrei. Of the 94 original enquiries, 90 came from the mother of the family and only 4 from the father. It was mainly women who attended the training sessions. We conclude from this, and from data on who practised most, that, in the UK, Johrei is more acceptable to women and that women are more likely to practise it in the home. Any future research should consider how crucial family participation is to the practise of Johrei. There are several implications of this recruitment problem for any future research into Johrei. Even a large-scale clinical trial, if it encountered similar reticence, but continued long enough or recruited widely enough to achieve a sufficiently large sample, would risk ending up with a highly selected sample. The generalizability of results from such a trial would be questionable. It would be criticized for recruiting a specialized population favorably predisposed towards Johrei, for whom expectations of benefit and likely placebo response might be considered particularly high.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24991" xml_f="25442" txt_i="20099" txt_f="20550">Of the 17 families who consented to join the trial, 13 attended any of the training sessions, 9 completed the training and only 4 stayed in the trial for the full 12 months. This retention problem, if repeated in any future controlled trial, would further limit the generalizability of its findings. High drop-out rates are not uncommon in trials of interventions requiring self-motivation and regular practise as for example in trials of meditation (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9"><offsets xml_i="25473" xml_f="25474" txt_i="20550" txt_f="20551">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25481" xml_f="25637" txt_i="20551" txt_f="20707">) and may compromise the randomization process by introducing systematic differences between experimental and control groups during the course of the trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25644" xml_f="26351" txt_i="20708" txt_f="21415">Having childhood eczema as one of the inclusion criteria restricted the pool of families from which to recruit and a research focus on the general health effects of the intervention might improve recruitment prospects. However, it was concern about the child's eczema which brought families into the study despite initial scepticism. Recruitment might also be helped by asking people to commit to a shorter trial. Several families in the trial stated that they would prefer to receive healing from a qualified practitioner, instead of, or in addition to the family healing, and this may have made the trial more attractive to prospective recruits. It would also have made the intervention more standardized.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26373" xml_f="26440" txt_i="21417" txt_f="21484">Did Families Practise Johrei Enough to Enjoy the Putative Benefits?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26451" xml_f="27082" txt_i="21485" txt_f="22116">Most families who stayed in the trial continued to practise throughout with a fairly constant regularity. Whether two sessions per individual per week on average is sufficient for any expected benefits to manifest themselves is a moot point. However, it is clearly the level which we can realistically expect from the average family asked to practise Johrei at home—if benefits do not manifest themselves at this level of practice, then it is not an effective health strategy in practice.

It should be possible to blind subjects as to whether they are receiving Johrei or a control procedure. In part this depends upon what is considered to be the essential and characteristic component of Johrei healing. If it is the healer's intention to heal and the putative energy transmitted during the channelling procedure, then a control procedure involving only touch delivered by actors or sham healers (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12"><offsets xml_i="27721" xml_f="27723" txt_i="22693" txt_f="22695">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27730" xml_f="28193" txt_i="22695" txt_f="23158">) could be used. If a specific type of touching is an essential part of Johrei, an adequate control could be non-specific touch or a specifically different type of touch. There needs to be similar time spent with individuals or in groups, similar opportunities for feedback and discussion of the health issues being researched and measures taken by those conducting the control procedure to create the feeling that a real and plausible intervention is being made.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28221" xml_f="28232" txt_i="23161" txt_f="23172">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28243" xml_f="29477" txt_i="23173" txt_f="24407">People in the UK, particularly men, are sceptical about Johrei healing. It is presently not generally an acceptable form of treatment and scepticism about Johrei is presently an obstacle to recruitment and retention of a representative sample in a clinical trial, and to its potential use in GP. The frequency and quality of practise at home by families may be insufficient to bring about the health benefits claimed for regular Johrei practise. Only 17 of the 65 families who expressed an initial interest in the trial and were eligible for inclusion were actually persuaded to enroll, and of these only 9 families completed the training and the first 3 months of the trial. While children in seven of these nine families apparently experienced improvement in their eczema symptoms, seasonal changes and other potential confounders mean that these changes cannot be attributed with any confidence to the practice of Johrei. From the four families who participated in the trial for the full 12 months, only one child showed a consistent improvement in eczema symptoms while for another early improvement was lost in the second 6 months of the trial. Convincing evidence for a positive effect on general family health was also lacking.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><citation
