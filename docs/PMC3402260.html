We also divided PHQ-9–assessed depression symptoms into somatic and psychological subsets and assessed whether each was related to all-cause mortality. All models used Cox proportional hazards regression model analyses to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CI) of the measure of depression. These analyses combined participants from the randomized groups and are thus epidemiologic in nature. There were no adjustments made for postrandomization events or measures. Participants with missing data were omitted from the models, resulting in ~4% loss in the most complex models.

Depression was not significantly associated with the primary composite ACCORD outcome or the secondary composite microvascular outcome.
