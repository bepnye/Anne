This is because the recipient may be inclined to look upon the questionnaire more approvingly, if the quality of paper used is high, thereby increasing the chance of a response.

The questionnaire sought views about current and future research priorities in gynaecological endoscopy. Recipients were randomised to receiving the questionnaire with a covering letter printed on standard quality white paper or high quality white paper. High quality paper was defined as a weight of 100 grams and standard quality paper as a weight of 80 grams. The participants were not informed of the randomisation to paper quality. The randomisation sequence was computer generated and group allocation was concealed from the participants throughout the study. No reminders were sent.

The low response rate in our survey may have resulted from the content our questionnaire as it enquired about research issues and so it is more likely that those with an active interest were likely to respond. However, any such selection biases should be minimised by the randomisation process and does not therefore affect the internal validity of our findings. The low response to our survey does limit the external validity or generalisability of our findings. Our power assumptions were not borne out by the response rates and some may argue that the apparent lack of an effect may be due to an inadequate sample. However, this would not explain a trend towards a lower response rate in the group allocated high quality paper. It may be that the 20 gram difference between paper weight in the two groups was too small so that recipients of 'high' quality paper did not readily distinguish it from there general day to day paperwork. It is also possible that our definition of paper quality using weight alone was inadequate and other features of stationary quality should have been used, such as colour intensity, laid paper and watermarking.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8505" xml_f="8788" txt_i="5030" txt_f="5313">Postal surveys are widely used because they represent a cost effective method of obtaining information from large numbers of geographically disparate medical professionals about their attributes, behaviours, attitudes and beliefs.
