In addition, the effect of reading the condom packaging instructions were similar for men and women on both an aggregate and an item-by-item basis. Lastly, only a small percentage of participants demonstrated errorless condom use (ie, perfect score on the MOCUS), irrespective of their group assignment. As such, these data suggest that condom packaging instructions alone do not provide sufficient information to teach errorless condom use. Because users may rely on these packaging instructions, it is important to ensure that they include the necessary information in a way that leads to correct condom usage.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22358" xml_f="23940" txt_i="17122" txt_f="18704">Although many of the differences between groups failed to reach statistical significance, there was a promising trend toward slightly better condom use skills among those who read condom packaging instructions. More specifically, the one-third of a MOCUS step difference observed for the aggregate efficacy measure can be attributed to the increased proportion of packaging instructions participants who correctly performed two of the seven condom use steps. As these two steps were among the least correctly performed by control participants, the greater than 40% improvement for those who read the packaging instructions becomes especially notable. Moreover, with Item 3 (ie, “Pinch reservoir tip with two fingers”) designed to minimize condom breakage and Item 5 (“Hold condom at base as condom is removed from partner”) designed to minimize slippage, correctly performing these steps reduces the risk of two different types of condom use failure. Despite this promising improvement, only two-thirds of participants correctly performed these steps immediately after reading the packaging instructions and these two steps alone are not sufficient to prevent condom use failures. The importance of this later issue is further echoed by the fraction of participants (16%) who completed all seven condom application and removal steps correctly. This may be, at least in part, due to characteristics of the written instructions, and researchers and condom companies should consider research outcomes on effective written instructions for procedural tasks when developing new leaflets.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-prbm-5-011"><offsets xml_i="23983" xml_f="23985" txt_i="18704" txt_f="18706">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23992" xml_f="24381" txt_i="18706" txt_f="19095"> Similarly, it would be beneficial to identify how written condom instructions can be improved. For example, leaflets may be improved by using larger font, more images, or clearer and more detailed images. These features may be most important to users who have difficulty reading, or difficulty reading small font, or for those whose native language is other than that used in the leaflet.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24388" xml_f="24692" txt_i="19096" txt_f="19400">Potentially meaningful improvements to the content of condom packaging instructions may also be ascertained from the present study. More specifically, of the seven total MOCUS items only four items were performed correctly by approximately one-half of control participants (ie, Items 3, 5, 6, and 7; see </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-prbm-5-011"><offsets xml_i="24735" xml_f="24742" txt_i="19400" txt_f="19407">Table 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24749" xml_f="25887" txt_i="19407" txt_f="20545">). In contrast, approximately 85% of control and condom packaging participants successfully completed the remaining three items (ie, Items 1, 2, and 4). These data suggest that areas with the greatest potential for improvement would be (a) pinching the reservoir tip with two fingers prior to application (Item 3), (b) holding the condom at the base of the penis while removing the penis from the partner (Item 5), (c) pinching the tip of the condom to secure ejaculate in the reservoir (Item 6), and (d) holding the condom at both the tip and base while removing the condom (Item 7). Performance on two of these four items with the greatest potential for improvement was, in fact, better among those who read the condom packaging instructions (ie, pinching the reservoir tip prior to application and holding the condom at the base while removing the penis from the partner). Moreover, if only these four items with the greatest for potential improvement are considered, the significant performance difference on Items 3 and 5 translates to a significant mean difference between the Condom Packaging and Control Groups (F[1, 203] = 5.43, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="25895" xml_f="25896" txt_i="20545" txt_f="20546">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="25905" xml_f="25915" txt_i="20546" txt_f="20556"> = 0.02, η</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="25920" xml_f="25921" txt_i="20556" txt_f="20557">2</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="25927" xml_f="26284" txt_i="20557" txt_f="20914"> = 0.026). As such, the overall finding of a non-significant difference between groups on the aggregate MOCUS score (based on all seven items) should be considered in light of key differences between groups on two of the four items with the lowest performance overall and, perhaps more importantly, the greatest potential for improvement in the first place.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26291" xml_f="27055" txt_i="20915" txt_f="21679">The low percentage of participants who correctly applied and removed the condom is particularly surprising given our sample of college students, most of whom were sexually active and endorsed past condom use and intentions to use condoms in the future. Because every item on the MOCUS assesses a behavior related to a condom use failure, errorless performance is ideal for risk prevention. These data suggest that condom users who rely on similar written instructional materials as those tested here may be increasing their risk of experiencing a condom use failure. As further evidence of this problem, approximately one-half of the sample reported experiencing at least one condom use failure.

Second, despite being equivalent on a number of key demographic and sexual history variables, the proportion of participants who reported experiencing a condom use failure was slightly higher among the randomly assigned Packaging Instructions Group. It should be noted, however, that this difference did not translate to corresponding differences in self-efficacy for a number of condom use factors, including the mechanics of condom application and removal, nor to differences in intentions to use condoms in the future. Similarly, prior and recent exposure to condom use instruction was not assessed in this study, which may present a potential alternative explanation for these findings if differences in exposure to condom use instructions existed between groups prior to the study. However, as noted above, random assignment was employed to minimize the possibility of such preexisting differences and the groups were similar on a variety of relevant demographic and sexual history variables (see </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-prbm-5-011"><offsets xml_i="28884" xml_f="28891" txt_i="23311" txt_f="23318">Table 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="28898" xml_f="29625" txt_i="23318" txt_f="24045">). Also, the single-shot, cross-sectional nature of the current design permits conclusions regarding group differences. An alternative design, such as a pre-post design, may permit stronger conclusions regarding learning or skill improvements from written condom packaging instructions. Lastly, this study assessed the effect on condom packaging instructions on the behavior of college students, and it is unclear if the instructions would be more or less effective with other populations, such as men who have sex with men, injection drug users, or sexually active adolescents. Including others in future research would provide a more complete understanding of the efficacy of condom packaging instructions across populations.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29632" xml_f="30554" txt_i="24046" txt_f="24968">This research served as an initial evaluation as to whether or not college students can demonstrate correct condom use skills after reading published condom packaging instructional leaflets. Considerations for future research are many. There exists a need to evaluate the effectiveness of instructional leaflets published by other brands, as their content may better inform correct condom usage. It also remains unclear whether other populations effectively learn condom use skills from these pamphlets. If these findings are replicated using different instructional leaflets or among other populations, then efforts should be focused on improving packaging instructions. Also, with the continued increase and availability of technology, consideration should be given to assessing the effectiveness and feasibility of alternative types of instructions, such as video demonstrations that can be downloaded to mobile phones.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30561" xml_f="31323" txt_i="24969" txt_f="25731">This research strengthens the literature documenting the high frequency on condom use failures, in this case, among college students. Clearly, there is need to reduce the frequency of these failures, and this study provides evidence that condom use skills are lacking, even among condom using college students, and also that current instructional leaflets are not adequate for those looking to learn correct condom use skills. Nonetheless, these data show that instructional leaflets do help with two specific condom use steps, and provide promise that if improved, instructional leaflets may become an effective, low-cost, and easily distributed approach to reducing condom use failures – an accomplishment that may go far toward our efforts to reduce HIV risk.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors wish to thank Thomas Brigham for his insights while providing feedback on the manuscript and who generously donated his time to helping us.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1-prbm-5-011"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflict of interests in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-prbm-5-011"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Divisions of HIV Prevention and the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention</collab><source>HIV Incidence</source><year>2008</year><comment>Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/print/incidence.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/print/incidence.htm</ext-link></comment><date-in-citation></date-in-citation></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-prbm-5-011"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health</collab><source>HIV/AIDS Quick Facts</source><year>2011</year><comment>Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/understanding/pages/quickfacts.aspx">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/understanding/pages/quickfacts.aspx</ext-link></comment><date-in-citation>Accessed December 30, 2011</date-in-citation></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-prbm-5-011"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Norris</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name><name><surname>Ford</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Associations between condom experiences and beliefs, intentions, and use in a sample of urban, low-income, African-American and Hispanic youth</article-title><source>AIDS Educ Prev</source><year>1994</year><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>27</fpage><lpage>39</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8024941</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-prbm-5-011"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Crosby</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>DiClemente</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Wingood</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>Condom failure among adolescents: implications for STD Prevention</article-title><source>J Adolesc Health</source><year>2005</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>534</fpage><lpage>536</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15901520</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-prbm-5-011"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lindemann</surname><given-names>DF</given-names></name></person-group><source>Comparing two condom use components of a HIV/AIDS intervention for college students (Doctoral Dissertation)</source><year>2003</year><publisher-name>Retrieved from Washington State University</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Pullman, WA</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="b6-prbm-5-011"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Warner</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Clay-Warner</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Boles</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Williamson</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Assessing condom use practices.
