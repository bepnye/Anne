Messages will be sent weekly for the first 6 weeks and fortnightly for the following 8 weeks. The recorded messages, which are free to receive, start playing when the phone is answered and are delivered through a secure online platform from ‘I Am Digital’ in Dhaka. If the call is not answered it is re-sent after 30 min and again after another 30 min. At the end of each of the 11 messages, the recipient can press keys one to five to select one of the following options: (1) repeat the message; (2) listen to one or more of seven additional messages, one about each modern method of contraception (condoms, pills, injectable, implant, IUD, male and female sterilization); (3) speak to a call centre counsellor; (4) report that they are fine and don’t need further information today or (5) opt out from receiving further messages. At recruitment, the participant is asked to select one of five time slots for receiving the messages. The content of the 11 messages is tailored to the individual’s chosen method as follows: the method of contraception received at the clinic is used to allocate participants to one of six message groups: no method users, condom users, pill users, injectable users, implant users and IUD users. Seven core messages will be sent to all participants reminding them of the benefits of using contraception, addressing key barriers such as fear of infertility and addressing information gaps, particularly around LARC and permanent methods. The remaining four messages will be specific to the method group for example, pill users will receive the seven core messages plus four messages tailored to supporting pill use. For current contraceptive users, the tailored messages provide information and support for continuation and correct use of their chosen method, they also aim to promote safe-switching among women who are not happy with their method. The tailored messages sent to non-users are designed to encourage uptake of contraception. Women are reminded at recruitment and in the messages to inform the call centre counsellor if they switch contraceptive methods.

Based on approximately 28,000 MR procedures conducted between November 2011 and June 2013 in government facilities supported by Ipas and approximately 16,500 in MSB clinics between October and December 2013, 7.0% of women are expected to select an IUD as their post-MR contraceptive method and 2.4% an implant, resulting in an expected 9.4% LARC uptake at baseline. A similar mHealth trial in Cambodia saw LARC use at 4 months increase from 9% to 29% with receipt of the intervention. Given the low cost of sending automated phone messages, a smaller increase may be programmatically important.

It is important to explore whether automated content can reduce cost by replacing counsellor time but remain effective. This evaluation will provide much-needed information on the effectiveness of an mHealth to inform women about effective methods of contraception, and facilitate adoption of these methods in the post-MR period. mHealth has great promise as a low-cost intervention, and this trial will produce results that can inform programs and policies in Bangladesh and elsewhere.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>IUD</term><def><p id="Par6">Intrauterine device</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LARC</term><def><p id="Par7">Long-acting reversible contraceptive</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mHealth</term><def><p id="Par8">mobile-phone-based health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MR</term><def><p id="Par9">Menstrual-regulation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRM</term><def><p id="Par10">Menstrual regulation with medicines</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSB</term><def><p id="Par11">Marie Stopes Bangladesh</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSI</term><def><p id="Par12">Marie Stopes International</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVA</term><def><p id="Par13">Manual vacuum aspiration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAC</term><def><p id="Par14">Post-abortion care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RA</term><def><p id="Par15">Research assistant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par16">Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RHSTEP</term><def><p id="Par17">Reproductive Health Services Training and Education Programme</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p id="Par18">Socio-economic status</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMS</term><def><p id="Par19">Short message service</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Pronab Choudhury and Jen Gassner for their contributions to the planning and development of the study and the intervention and Ian Askew for his comments on the original study protocol.
