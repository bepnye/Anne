However, the significance of changes in the CD4 count in the PHF arm depended partly on the statistical model used for evaluation. The mean rate of CD4 cell decrease in the PHF arm was 14.3 ± 6.1 cells/μl per year when regression analysis was performed. A more rigorous analysis performed using the Generalized Estimating Equations showed a non-significant mean CD4 cell reduction from baseline 222.2 cells/μl to 211.0 cells/μl at 12 months. At 24 months, this number dropped further which was significant compared to the baseline value but not if Bonferroni correction was applied.

First, the study was an open-label trial. Given the nature of the medicines, the identity of the medicines could not be concealed from the participants, therefore, the placebo effect could not be eliminated from the study outcome. The investigators at the JNCASR laboratory were however, blinded to the identity of the group allocation until the time of unblinding.

Fourth, the quality control of the herbal medicines remains a universal problem with variations in the formulations, ingredients and administration. We prepared a single lot of the PHF that was used for the entire clinical trial, toxicity studies and laboratory assays thus partially addressing this question. Fifth, given the recruitment criteria, a ‘selection bias’ may have crept into the study design. Although the study subjects cannot be technically qualified as long-term non-progressors or elite controllers, some of them being intrinsically resistant to disease progression cannot be ruled out. Lastly, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis was offered to all the HAART and several PHF participants especially during year 2.
