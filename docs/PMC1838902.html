Sixty children with spastic diplegic CP between the ages of 7 and 18 years and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels of I, II, or III will be recruited for this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention (cycling) or a control (no cycling) group. The cycling intervention will be divided into strengthening and cardiorespiratory endurance exercise phases. During the strengthening phase, the resistance to lower extremity cycling will be progressively increased using a uniquely designed limb-loaded mechanism. The cardiorespiratory endurance phase will focus on increasing the intensity and duration of cycling. Children will be encouraged to exercise within a target heart rate (HR) range (70 – 80% maximum HR). Thirty sessions will take place over a 10–12 week period. All children will be evaluated before (baseline) and after (follow-up) the intervention period. Primary outcome measures are: knee joint extensor and flexor moments, or torque; the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM); the 600 Yard Walk-Run test and the Thirty-Second Walk test (30 sec WT).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6161" xml_f="6171" txt_i="1829" txt_f="1839">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6182" xml_f="6443" txt_i="1840" txt_f="2101">This paper presents the rationale, design and protocol for Pediatric Endurance and Limb Strengthening (PEDALS); a Phase I randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a stationary cycling intervention for children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6505" xml_f="6515" txt_i="2110" txt_f="2120">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6526" xml_f="6678" txt_i="2121" txt_f="2273">Cerebral palsy (CP) is caused by an insult to the developing brain.

The exercise mode is adjustable from a front operation panel using two different options: "Aerobic exercise – constant power" or "Strengthening exercise – isokinetic". The aerobic exercise mode employs an effort level control from 1–30. The strength exercise mode uses a speed control increment from 25 to 120 degrees per minute.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20296" xml_f="20468" txt_i="14643" txt_f="14815">Cyclocentric cycling is a unique limb-loaded feature of this stationary bicycle and its use for rehabilitation following stroke has been described by Brown and colleagues [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35"><offsets xml_i="20500" xml_f="20502" txt_i="14815" txt_f="14817">35</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20509" xml_f="21281" txt_i="14817" txt_f="15589">]. To use this feature, the seat is released and allowed to slide forward and backward along a linear track. The seat is released by pulling a handle located just below the bicycle's front panel. Up to ten tensioning cords (10 lbs of force per cord) can be attached to the base of the seat acting to pull the seat forward, thereby passively flexing the subject's lower extremities. Extension of one lower limb is necessary to resist the excessive flexion caused by the tensioning cords, and to maintain the seat within a desired range called the "cyclocentric exercise zone".

The optimal frequency is three times per week over a ten-week period; however, this alternative schedule provides flexibility for vacations, illnesses or other events. Each session will last approximately 60 minutes. Subjects will be asked to wear shorts and tennis shoes during each session for comfort, safety and assessment purposes. They will receive individualized instruction for an independent self-stretching exercise program for bilateral hip flexor, knee extensor, knee flexor, and ankle plantar flexor muscles as a 5–10 minute warm-up prior to cycling. Additional muscle groups that exhibit reduced range of motion may be included in the stretching program for individual subjects. The cycling intervention will be divided into two phases: 1) Lower extremity strengthening and 2) Cardiorespiratory endurance.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22374" xml_f="22412" txt_i="16563" txt_f="16601">Phase 1: lower extremity strengthening</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22423" xml_f="24315" txt_i="16602" txt_f="18494">The seat location will be adjusted to ensure a knee joint angle of between 15 and 20 degrees of flexion when the knee is maximally extended during cycling. Subjects will be instructed to hold onto the side of the seat because it is possible to slide the seat backwards by pushing with the upper extremities when using the alternate hand rest position on the front of the bicycle. Lower extremity resistance training will begin with the attachment of one tensioning cord. The seat will be released and the subject instructed to begin cycling while keeping the seat within the desired cyclocentric zone. If the subject has difficulty transferring resistance from one limb to the other, the therapist may assist by stabilizing the seat in the desired cyclocentric zone as the lower limb moves from maximum flexion into extension at the top of the pedal revolution. Difficulty during this transition results in a "jerking forward" of the seat rather than a smooth rhythmic cycling motion. If the subject continues to have difficulty with this transition, the therapist may physically assist the foot in moving forward through the top of the pedaling cycle. The subject will be instructed to avoid "locking" the knees in full extension near the bottom of the pedaling cycle, a strategy that might occur as a compensation for weakness. If this deviation persists, a physical block will be slid along the track and positioned behind the seat to prevent excessive knee extension. Once the subject is able to cycle in a smooth pattern without difficulty for ten complete pedaling revolutions, a second tensioning cord will be engaged increasing the resistance to 20 lbs. The above protocol will be repeated until the subject either cannot cycle at the next higher cord increment or the cycling pattern is not smooth. This level of resistance will be recorded as the maximum cord level for the session.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24322" xml_f="24837" txt_i="18495" txt_f="19010">During subsequent sessions, the subject will begin with a minimum of 20 revolutions at cord levels below the previous session's maximum. They will progress to the maximum cord level, gradually increasing the number of revolutions. During each session, the minimum and maximum number of tensioning cords and the corresponding number of revolutions will be recorded. The maximum resistance possible is 10 cords, or 100 lbs of force.

The seat will be positioned to ensure that the subject's knee joint is in 15 – 20 degrees of flexion when maximally extended. Cycling resistance will be adjusted using the "Aerobic exercise – constant power" mode. Cycling will begin at a low level and be adjusted up or down according to the subject's ability. If the subject is able to cycle for 10 consecutive minutes within the target HR range, the therapist will switch to the "Strength exercise – isokinetic" mode with a setting of 60 cycles per minute for a two-minute period, thus increasing the intensity of the resistance. The goal for the initial session is 15 minutes of cycling. A variety of motivational strategies will be used during the intervention to promote continued cycling and to increase intensity of effort. Therapists will place the HR monitor in front of the subject and encourage them to cycle faster in order to increase their HR. Additional strategies include verbal encouragement, listening to music, pretend play and counting the number of lower extremity revolutions possible while maintaining a given HR level or exercise level setting on the bicycle. The child will be asked to describe their perceived exertion throughout the cycling session using the CERT. If the HR is below target range but the subject is cycling at a high rate, the constant level resistance will be increased. If a subject expresses a high level of fatigue, or a CERT level of 9 or 10, the constant level resistance will be decreased or the subject will be instructed to slow the pedaling rate. Subjects will be encouraged to gradually increase their exercise duration to a maximum of 30 minutes over the thirty sessions. A cool-down period will occur at the end of the intervention as the subject pedals without resistance until his or her HR decreases to within 20 beats above baseline. Therapists will be provided with a worksheet to record HR and CERT levels. For each session, an intervention form will be completed containing the following information: 1) baseline HR; 2) target HR range; 3) aerobic exercise level setting; 4) the subject's typical exercise HR (TEHR); 5) duration of the TEHR; 6) time to reach TEHR; 7) total cycling duration and 8) CERT level while at TEHR.
