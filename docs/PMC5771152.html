DMPA is the most common contraceptive used in many countries worst affected by the HIV epidemic. To provide robust evidence for contraceptive decision-making among women, clinicians and planners, we are conducting the Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) study in four countries with high HIV incidence and DMPA use: Kenya, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zambia (Clinical Trials.gov identifier NCT02550067).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9403" xml_f="10163" txt_i="652" txt_f="1412"> Study design: We randomized HIV negative, sexually active women 16-35 years old requesting effective contraception and agreeing to participate to either DMPA, the copper T 380A intrauterine device or levonorgestrel implant. Participants attend a contraception support visit after 1 month and quarterly visits thereafter for 12 to 18 months. Participants receive a standard HIV prevention package and contraceptive side-effect management at each visit. The primary outcome is HIV seroconversion. Secondary outcomes include pregnancy, serious adverse events and method discontinuation. The sample size of 7800 women provides 80% power to detect a 50% difference in HIV risk between any of the three method pairs, assuming 250 incident infections per comparison.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10170" xml_f="10732" txt_i="1413" txt_f="1975"> Ethical considerations: Several WHO consultations have concluded that current evidence on HIV risk associated with DMPA is inconclusive and that a randomized trial is needed to guide policy, counselling and choice. Previous studies suggest that women without a specific contraceptive preference are willing to accept randomization to different contraceptive methods. Stringent performance standards are monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board approximately every 6 months. The study has been conducted with extensive stakeholder engagement.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10739" xml_f="10929" txt_i="1976" txt_f="2166"> Conclusions: The ECHO study is designed to provide robust evidence on the relative risks (HIV acquisition) and benefits (pregnancy prevention) between three effective contraceptive methods.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>contraception</kwd><kwd>HIV acquisition</kwd><kwd>effectiveness</kwd><kwd>randomized trial</kwd><kwd>DMPA</kwd><kwd>IUD</kwd><kwd>implants</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>Medical Research Council of South Africa</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-2" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865"><funding-source>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</funding-source><award-id>OPP1032115</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-3" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000200"><funding-source>United States Agency for International Development</funding-source><award-id>AID-OAA-A-15-00045</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-4"><funding-source>Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1032115], the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [AID-OAA-A-15-00045], the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and the Medical Research Council of South Africa. </funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title><offsets xml_i="12155" xml_f="12167" txt_i="2174" txt_f="2186">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12178" xml_f="12342" txt_i="2187" txt_f="2348">Women living in sub Saharan Africa (SSA) face an unacceptably high risk of maternal mortality, with an estimated mortality ratio of &gt;500 per 100,000 live births

The possibility of an RCT comparing effective contraceptive methods and HIV acquisition risk has been raised since the 1990’s. However, questions surrounding evidence (sufficient to motivate a trial, insufficient to make a trial unnecessary), logistics (whether possible to randomize participants), ethics (to randomize vs. providing a choice of contraception, and/or to provide a method that may increase HIV risk), and funding stalled efforts to initiate such a study. Programs remained uncertain about how to counsel women in these settings, given the limitations and inconsistency in the evidence. In response, the ECHO Consortium was founded in 2012 as representatives of FHI 360, the University of Washington, and the University of the Witwatersrand Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (Wits RHI) came together with The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to plan a randomized trial of effective contraception (initially including DMPA, NET-EN, the levonorgestrel implant and the copper IUD) and HIV acquisition. In 2013, the WHO joined the leadership of the Consortium study to address the concern that a planned 2-arm WHO trial might prejudice the possibility of comparing DMPA with a variety of other effective contraceptive methods. In December 2015, with considerable external stakeholder input, we launched the Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) Trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="16611" xml_f="16625" txt_i="6097" txt_f="6111">Study protocol</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16636" xml_f="16822" txt_i="6112" txt_f="6298">The ECHO study protocol is registered at Clinical Trials.gov (Identifier NCT02550067) and with the WHO as part of their clinical trials database.

Sites scheduled women for enrolment visits within 1–42 days of screening. At enrolment, staff obtained informed consent for enrolment, women were randomly allocated to and received their study contraceptive method, received risk reduction and contraceptive counselling, a limited behavioural and clinical assessment, and were tested for pregnancy. At 1-month, participants were seen to address any initial side effects, receive further counselling on their contraceptive methods, review relevant adverse events, and confirm IUD and implant presence. Subsequent follow-up visits at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months consist of contraceptive counselling, limited behavioural assessment, review of relevant adverse events, syndromic assessment/treatment of reproductive tract infections (RTIs), provision of male and/or female condoms, assessment for pregnancy, and provision of injectable contraception, as appropriate.

A recent model concluded that if injectable contraceptive use increased the risk of HIV infection by 1.2-2.19-fold, it could result in 27,000–130,000 new infections per year globally; 87–88% of these additional infections would occur in Southern and Eastern Africa

The total sample size of 7,800 women was selected assuming an underlying HIV incidence of 3.5 per 100 woman-years, 18 months of prescribed follow-up per woman, and a maximum of 10% loss to follow-up or early discontinuation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37309" xml_f="37331" txt_i="23726" txt_f="23748">Ethical considerations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37342" xml_f="37704" txt_i="23749" txt_f="24111">Randomization to contraceptive methods has historically been controversial.

On the other hand, several WHO consultations occurring both prior to and during the ECHO Trial that included exhaustive reviews of the literature and assessment by independent expert panels from various disciplines have concluded that the evidence is inconclusive. Furthermore, any weighing of the relative benefits and risks needs to include all relevant effects, such as the reduction in the risks of unintended pregnancy and the value of DMPA as an effective, acceptable and confidential contraceptive method.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39069" xml_f="39086" txt_i="25238" txt_f="25255">Study feasibility</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39097" xml_f="39439" txt_i="25256" txt_f="25598">Prior to the start of the trial, interested colleagues voiced concerns about the feasibility of the trial including a) the feasibility of enroling and randomizing 7,800 women to different contraceptive methods, b) achieving high contraceptive method continuation in the trial, and c) enroling a study population with sufficient HIV incidence
</offsets><xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="39479" xml_f="39481" txt_i="25598" txt_f="25600">27</offsets></sup></xref><xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="39534" xml_f="39536" txt_i="25600" txt_f="25602">28</offsets></sup></xref><offsets xml_i="39549" xml_f="40484" txt_i="25602" txt_f="26537">. Addressing the first concern, the ECHO trial has emphasized enroling only women that are truly willing to using any of the three methods by counseling those who appear to favor one method over another not to enrol. At screening, women receive extensive counseling on all the risk and benefits of each study method; they also leave the study site after screening and return 1 to 42 days later for enrolment. This gives women a chance to reflect on their participation and willingness to use any of the three methods as well as necessitating an additional action (returning to the study site) to enrol in the study. The study metrics agreed upon prior to the study (outlined above) specified an acceptable enrolment rate and rate of refusal to be randomized and plans were in place to stop the trial if enrolment performance was poor. The ECHO Trial has now recruited and randomized 7,830 women with low refusal rates (data not shown).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40491" xml_f="41501" txt_i="26538" txt_f="27545">The second feasibility issue – achieving high contraceptive method continuation – was a salient concern for the study investigators as many family planning programs have significant rates of discontinuation of the three study methods within the first 12–18 months and high contraceptive discontinuation would adversely affect trial integrity. The trial has a goal of achieving 90% contraceptive continuation for each of the study methods (i.e. &lt;10% loss of follow-up time on the study method). Accordingly, the ECHO Team has put significant resources into training (and retraining) study clinicians on contraceptive clinical and counseling techniques. Issues affecting contraceptive continuation are discussed on weekly calls and several highly trained consortium staff members are available on a daily basis to respond to contraceptive issues arising at sites. In addition, the study included a 1-month follow-up visit to specifically address side effects and other concerns with the contraceptive methods.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41508" xml_f="42472" txt_i="27546" txt_f="28510">The feasibility of ECHO was also questioned in relation to accruing sufficient HIV endpoints to have adequate study power. The trial is endpoint driven, defined by the target of observing at least 250 incident HIV infections per pairwise comparison. Based on enrolment of 7800 women, follow-up of 18 months, and a maximum 10% loss to follow-up or early method discontinuation, the trial requires an underlying HIV incidence of 3.5/100 person-years. A site selection committee researched and visited more than 30 possible sites using multiple selection criteria including HIV incidence (≥ 3.0/100 person-years per site and an overall incidence across all study sites of ≥ 3.5/100 person-years). We used multiple data sources to estimate incidence rates for sites (or their surrounding areas) including data from recently completed HIV prevention trials (e.g., FACTS, ASPIRE, VOICE, etc.) to select a group of sites projected to have sufficiently high HIV incidence.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42479" xml_f="42752" txt_i="28511" txt_f="28784">Finally, several scientific colleagues argued that the funding for an RCT of DMPA and HIV acquisition, even if ethical and feasible, could be better spent on other areas of research and programming such as expanding the contraceptive method mix in East and Southern Africa

Such arguments suggest that investments in programming and research are a zero-sum game and that money invested in the ECHO trial would necessarily take funding away from programmes aimed at increasing access to a variety of effective contraceptive methods. Additionally, these arguments assume that other methods such as implants and IUDs are not associated with HIV risk. However, the ECHO team believes that there are sufficient funds to simultaneously address increased method mix and provide program managers and women with the highest quality scientific evidence upon which to make their family planning decisions

It is unclear whether DMPA plays a role in increased HIV susceptibility. The ECHO Trial has been designed to provide the highest quality evidence to resolve this important public health question. Thorough attention has been given to various design characteristics such as the choice of study arms, the effect size that it is designed to detect, and the ethical and feasibility challenges. Some of the challenges, such as the feasibility to enrol and randomize women to the three study arms have now been successfully mitigated. Others, including high method continuation and retention, continue to receive great attention. We anticipate that the ECHO Trial will provide high quality evidence on the risks and benefits of the three contraceptive methods and will thus allow women, clinicians, program managers and policymakers to make informed decisions about contraceptive choices for women at high risk of HIV infection.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="45240" xml_f="45245" txt_i="30929" txt_f="30934">Notes</offsets></title><p id="fn1"><offsets xml_i="45265" xml_f="45299" txt_i="30935" txt_f="30969">
