In the ten minutes immediately preceding the decision point, GPs dominated the conversation, accounting for 64% (58–66%) of all utterances and this trend was similar across all three arms of the trial. Information-giving was the most frequent activity for both GPs and patients, although GPs did this at twice the rate compared to patients and at higher rates in consultations involving computerised decision aids. GPs' language was highly technically focused and just 7% of their conversation was socio-emotional in content; this was half the socio-emotional content shown by patients (15%). However, frequent head nodding and a close mirroring in the direction of eye-gaze suggested that both parties were active participants in the conversation</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5838" xml_f="5848" txt_i="2047" txt_f="2057">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5859" xml_f="6481" txt_i="2058" txt_f="2680">Irrespective of the arm of the trial, both patients' and GPs' behaviour showed that they were reciprocally engaged in these consultations. However, even in consultations aimed at promoting shared decision-making, GPs' were verbally dominant, and they worked primarily as information providers for patients. In addition, computer-based decision aids significantly prolonged the consultations, particularly the later phases. These data suggest that decision aids may not lead to more 'sharing' in treatment decision-making and that, in their current form, they may take too long to negotiate for use in routine primary care.</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6543" xml_f="6553" txt_i="2689" txt_f="2699">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6564" xml_f="6828" txt_i="2700" txt_f="2964">Clinicians increasingly recognise the importance of engaging patients in health care especially where decisions about treatment have significant effects on quality of life or where there are choices between alternative therapies with differing risks and benefits [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="6859" xml_f="6860" txt_i="2964" txt_f="2965">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6867" xml_f="6868" txt_i="2965" txt_f="2966">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="6899" xml_f="6900" txt_i="2966" txt_f="2967">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6907" xml_f="7075" txt_i="2967" txt_f="3135">].

This quantitative observational work was part of a larger mixed-method (video and interview-based) process study of a randomised controlled trial. The parent trial aimed to promote decision making in primary care via the use of three arms: two computerised patient decision aids delivered in a shared decision making consultation; and a control condition of paper-based guidelines applied in a paternalistic way as a source of doctor-led advice. In the process study, we did not begin with a specific hypothesis concerning the impact of these decision aids on the consultation. In line with the qualitative research tradition, we wished to inductively identify and describe the differences in interactional behaviour between the three arms. However, this involved two informal hypotheses.

Indeed we observed no significant difference in verbal dominance, or clear differences in verbal content, between the 'shared decision making' consultations of the computerised decision aids and the 'paternalistic' consultations involving paper-guidelines. This may appear counter-intuitive, in that one might expect shared decision making consultations to have less verbal dominance than paternalistic consultations. However, it may be that it takes considerable verbal work from doctors to introduce and sustain any model.

Moreover, since the data were not normally distributed, we used conservative non-parametric statistics in our analysis, which was intended to be primarily descriptive. Thus it is possible that real but small differences between the three types of consultation were not detected which may have emerged with a larger sample. Also the efficacy design of the trial meant that just one GP delivered each decision aid and so our findings may be confounded by GPs' style in consultations rather than the decision aid per se. Nevertheless, the GPs' verbal dominance and technical focus was apparent across all the consultations on this study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34952" xml_f="35674" txt_i="27609" txt_f="28331">Although patients were randomised into the parent trial, we used a convenience sample of the first 29 patients who agreed to be videotaped (31 were asked). The trial eventually recruited 109 patients [54]. In addition, the earlier recruits in our study are more likely to be prevalent cases in the population with a longer experience of atrial fibrillation compared to later incident cases. Moreover, the third arm of the trial (explicit version of DARTS II) was discontinued after eight consultations as a result of data produced by process study. We observed that a number of patients found it difficult to understand the preference elicitation exercise in these consultations and were uncomfortable with this activity [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"><offsets xml_i="35706" xml_f="35708" txt_i="28331" txt_f="28333">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35715" xml_f="36152" txt_i="28333" txt_f="28770">]. Thus this divergence between the early process study and the final trial clearly limits our ability to generalise findings from the former to the latter.

For instance, some physical examination work was included in most time-samples from guidelines consultations, some from implicit tool consultations and none from the explicit tool consultations. However, the lack of clear differences in verbal behaviour between the trial arms suggests that the latter did not strongly affect our analysis.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37341" xml_f="37659" txt_i="29863" txt_f="30181">Perhaps most importantly, the patients in this study were also participants in a trial who had experienced extensive consent procedures, who were not seeing their own GP and who were attending an unfamiliar clinic.

In this way, the impact of the trial context on both patients and clinicians may have outweighed any impact of the decision aids themselves.

The work in this study revealed significant difficulties for patients with the extended version of the DARTS II tool, despite earlier pilot work. We also found that working with this decision aid took clinicians and patients much longer than the time usually available for consultations in primary care. Thus further development of this decision aid may be required before the next evaluative stage which should incorporate a more pragmatic (clinically representative) study design.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39353" xml_f="39363" txt_i="31727" txt_f="31737">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39374" xml_f="40724" txt_i="31738" txt_f="33088">This study showed clear differences in the duration of primary care consultations depending on the form of decision aid used. The use of paper-based guidelines took twice the time usually available in primary care and computerised decision aids took three or four times longer than a standard consultation. Thus, unless specific clinics are set aside for such work, it is unlikely that traditional or technologically focused decision aids will be easily incorporated into routine primary care. Furthermore, even in consultations aimed at promoting shared decision-making, GPs were verbally dominant and more technically focused than patients. Moreover despite differences in the technological sophistication of the decision aids, we found almost no difference in behaviour indicative of shared decision-making across the trial arms. Responsibility for the enactment of a shared decision-making consultation may therefore remain within the interactional space between GP and patient. Decision aids may well be closer to their designation than currently perceived; optional resources which foster information transfer rather than shared decision-making machines. Our data showed the extensive use of these tools in presenting complex information to the patient. However, we found no clear evidence that they promoted the sharing of treatment decisions.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="40746" xml_f="40765" txt_i="33090" txt_f="33109">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40776" xml_f="40836" txt_i="33110" txt_f="33170">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="40858" xml_f="40880" txt_i="33172" txt_f="33194">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40891" xml_f="40991" txt_i="33195" txt_f="33295">EK, CM and RT conceived the original design for the process study and secured funding for the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40998" xml_f="41177" txt_i="33296" txt_f="33475">BH and TR carried out the data collection for the observational part of the process study.
