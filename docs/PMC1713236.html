This allocation was conducted independently of the study researchers and the clinicians involved in the treatment of the patients, although it was not possible to remain blind to allocation once randomisation had been completed. Due to resource constraints and the initial costs associated with acupuncture, unequal randomisation was used, so 10 patients were randomised to receive acupuncture plus usual GP care, and 14 to usual GP care only.

When piloting the analysis for the full-scale trial, and controlling for baseline score on the NPQ, the adjusted difference between the means of the two groups was -1.75 percentage points in favour of the acupuncture group, although this difference was not statistically significant (t = -.311, p = 0.759). At three months, a similar proportion of patients in the GP care only group continued to use medication when compared to baseline, but there was a marked reduction in medication use in the acupuncture group.
