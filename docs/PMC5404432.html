Inclusion criteria were patients with nonhealing stage 4 pressure ulcers, and exclusion criteria were patients with comorbidities. Consent to participate in the study was signed. To study the effectiveness of COP flaps in the treatment of pressure ulcers, 11 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group (COP flap) and 9 patients to the control group (conventional method without anchoring technique). At the time of presentation, the patients were randomly assigned to either the conventional method or the COP flap group. All patients underwent the same optimization before undergoing either flap treatment to guarantee uniformity in both groups. To ensure that the patients of each group were at similar baseline status during the start of the treatment and to avoid selection bias, the following factors were addressed: nutritional status to an albumin &gt; 3.0 g/dL, prealbumin &gt; 20 mg/dL, and transferrin &gt; 0.2 g/dL; control of muscle spasms; pressure control devices such as air mattress beds and turning protocols; and scheduled dressing changes to maintain wounds clean.

A straight needle was inserted at the deepest point of the undermined area and then passed in horizontal mattress fashion through the tip of the flap and back to the normal tissues and the xeroform gauze.
