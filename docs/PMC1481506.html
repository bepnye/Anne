After 13 participants had completed the protocol (blood LH from one could not be used), it was unfortunately necessary to discontinue the inpatient studies, because of loss of GCRC funding. An additional 7 subjects completed the protocol entirely at home, collecting urine but no blood samples. Resources did not permit recruitment of the final 10 subjects planned.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17685" xml_f="17691" txt_i="12162" txt_f="12168">Assays</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17702" xml_f="17768" txt_i="12169" txt_f="12235">LH levels in blood and urine were measured using DSL-10-460 Active</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="17773" xml_f="17775" txt_i="12235" txt_f="12237">R </offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="17781" xml_f="19087" txt_i="12237" txt_f="13540">LH Elisa kits (Diagnostic System Laboratories, Inc, Webster, TX.) This is an enzymatically amplified "one-step" sandwich-type immunoassay. The manufacturer states that there is no detectable cross-reactivity with TSH, FSH, and hCG. Blood samples were measured by direct addition of 50 μL serum, whereas urine samples were measured by diluting 1:1 with zero standards (each at 25 μL). For accuracy, above-scale LH urine samples (&gt; 180 mIU/ml) were re-assayed at increased dilutions. The sensitivity of the EIA is 0.1 mIU/ml. At mean LH concentrations of 3.2 mIU/ml and 30.8 mIU/ml, intra-assay coefficients of variation were 2.2% and 4.9% respectively, and inter-assay CVs were 2.9% and 4.8% respectively. Urinary rates of LH excretion (mIU/hr) were computed by multiplying the urine LH concentration (mIU/ml) by the urine excretion rate (ml/hr) calculated over the interval between voidings. Measured urinary LH excretion was quite erratic from day to day, with the daily standard deviation being 69% of the mean. Therefore, for each subject, daily urine LH mIU/hr values outside a range of ± 2SD were ignored, in most cases leaving 8–9 values for computation of slopes. The first and last values meeting the ± 2SD criteria were also selected to explore changes in urinary LH excretion during treatment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19109" xml_f="19119" txt_i="13542" txt_f="13552">Statistics</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19130" xml_f="19388" txt_i="13553" txt_f="13811">Contrasts between groups were examined using ANOVA, with the initial score as the covariate.

This result was statistically marginal. The amount of suppression compared to placebo was very modest, considering the high levels of secretion among women of this age. Indeed, since participants receiving placebo showed higher LH at the end of treatment than at baseline, suppression in the group receiving melatonin in the evening was suggested merely by a smaller percentage increase than in the placebo group. The directions of change were similar in both blood and urine LH. Urine results were far more erratic, but perhaps because data for urine LH were available for more subjects, the contrasts were somewhat more statistically significant. Because fewer subjects than planned were studied and the statistical outcome was not conclusive, these results certainly need replication.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27460" xml_f="27996" txt_i="21138" txt_f="21674">It was interesting to observe that morning melatonin was associated with more suppression of LH than evening melatonin, though not significantly so. Perhaps melatonin administration 4–5 hours before bedtime might have served to make the evening onset of melatonin more dramatically early and more effective. The investigators had not chosen to give evening melatonin 4–5 hours before bedtime, because it was believed that evening sedation and a possibly unwanted advance in sleep timing might be more severe with earlier administration.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28003" xml_f="28646" txt_i="21675" txt_f="22318">It would be important to examine melatonin effects on the reproductive endocrinology of women of other ages and effects on men. Due to the excess LH secretion of postmenopausal women, effects of melatonin were not expected to be harmful to this group. However, if melatonin interferes with the reproductive endocrinology of women attempting to have children or suppresses LH (and thus testosterone) among men, such effects might be quite unwelcome. Since melatonin is becoming popular in the treatment of children with developmental problems, it would also be important to explore whether melatonin interferes with their endocrine development.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28653" xml_f="29420" txt_i="22319" txt_f="23086">The observations were consistent with the hypothesis that photoperiodic mechanisms are active in human physiology. The timing chosen (well before bedtime or after arising) and the low dosage of melatonin, designed to simulate effects of a natural winter photoperiod upon the melatonin profile, may explain why we were able to demonstrate this marginal melatonin effect on LH, when other studies have not had similar results. Both the before-bedtime and morning administration would tend to extend the duration of the nightly melatonin elevation. Possibly, other studies have failed to document an effect of melatonin on LH because bedtime dosing or use of higher doses creates 24-hour melatonin profiles less similar to those produced by a natural winter photoperiod.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29427" xml_f="29500" txt_i="23087" txt_f="23160">Nevertheless, it might be possible to further optimize timing and dosage.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="29522" xml_f="29532" txt_i="23162" txt_f="23172">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29543" xml_f="29954" txt_i="23173" txt_f="23584">The results of this study did not support our hypothesis that melatonin would improve sleep and suppress hot flashes among symptomatic postmenopausal women, but there were no significant adverse effects, and LH was possibly suppressed.
