Such countries generally lack the kind of health system that is able to record the cause of death for each person who dies. This makes it very hard to know the number of people whose deaths are related to AIDS. The uncertainty over the AIDS death rates in these countries causes many problems. For example, it will be hard to establish how effective the introduction of AIDS treatment drugs is proving to be in reducing the number of AIDS deaths. A new approach is needed to determine and record the causes of deaths in these countries. It is not enough to rely on knowing whether the person who has died has been found to be HIV positive; many people in poor countries who have AIDS have never been tested, and, in any case, the cause of death in a person with HIV may not necessarily be related to the virus.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title><offsets xml_i="8817" xml_f="8841" txt_i="2940" txt_f="2964">Why Was This Study Done?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8852" xml_f="9444" txt_i="2965" txt_f="3557">The researchers wanted to investigate the use of the technique called “verbal autopsy.” This involves asking those who were with the deceased person before they died—usually close family members—a series of standard questions about the symptoms the person had. This is now a recognized technique, but the researchers wanted to know specifically how effective it can be in identifying AIDS as the cause of death. It is also important to “validate” the set of questions chosen to be used in a verbal autopsy, to see how likely they are to produce the correct explanation for the cause of death.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title><offsets xml_i="9476" xml_f="9513" txt_i="3559" txt_f="3596">What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9524" xml_f="10220" txt_i="3597" txt_f="4293">The researchers drew up a list of what they considered appropriate questions and used them in interviews (conducted by nurses) with the caregivers of 381 adults who died between 1998 and 2003 in Manicaland, a rural area of eastern Zimbabwe. For all of these people, it was known whether they were HIV positive or HIV negative. (This information is not known for most deaths in rural Zimbabwe.) The 282 people who were HIV positive and did not die in an accident or during childbirth were considered by the researchers to have died of AIDS.

Explanations of what these conditions looked like were given to the caregivers. There were also questions on the circumstances surrounding each death. Using the answers to the questions, it was possible in 69% of cases to make a correct decision as to whether the death was the result of AIDS.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title><offsets xml_i="10913" xml_f="10941" txt_i="4950" txt_f="4978">What Do These Findings Mean?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10952" xml_f="11365" txt_i="4979" txt_f="5392">A verbal autopsy using the signs and symptoms selected by these authors can be used to make reasonable estimates of the number of AIDS deaths.

However, there are two main problems with this approach that our study may have partially overcome. First, the populations who die in hospital in settings with poor health infrastructure may not be representative in terms of age, gender, or cause of death. In this study 25% of deaths amongst HIV-positive individuals occurred in hospital compared with 33% in HIV-negative persons (unpublished data). Second, in places where stigma and shame are borne by relatives of a person with AIDS, hospital records may not reflect the true number of AIDS deaths. Indeed, amongst the deaths in this study, only 71 (18%) had a death certificate, of which 31 (62%) of HIV-positive deaths noted AIDS/HIV. Therefore, for attribution to the single cause of AIDS, where it is known that mortality rates are approximately ten times higher amongst HIV-positive people, it is likely that fewer misclassifications would be made based principally on diagnostic results from up to three years prior to death as compared with hospital records. We estimate 5% misclassification of AIDS/non-AIDS deaths. Although any misclassification is not ideal in a gold standard, we argue that this level of misclassification compares favourably with hospital records in this setting and, importantly, provides a quantification of the level of misclassification which is impossible in most hospital-based studies. In the worst-case scenario, where all misclassifications in the gold standard are misclassified by the algorithm, we would expect a drop in the sensitivity to about 71% (down from 76%) and specificity to about 62% (down from 66%).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43415" xml_f="43675" txt_i="30472" txt_f="30732">Incorrect classification of HIV status at baseline would affect the validity of the gold standard.
