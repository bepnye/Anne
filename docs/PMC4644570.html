The BMG was then incubated with Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin for 1 h at 37 °C. The resulting BMG was lyophilized and stored in a desiccator at room temperature followed by sterilization with ethylene oxide, and degassing. To get a reasonable result with BMG graft, particle sizes of 74–500 µm should be resized into 200–500 µm. Therefore, after lyophilization, BMG pieces were put in a mortar and liquid nitrogen was added to it and pieces of bone matrix were chipped by pestle. The next stage was the use of standard 250–500-µm sieves to separate suitable sized particles. Then, an accurate scale was used to weight BMG in packages of 2 mg.

Regarding bone density, there was no significant difference between BMG and autogenous bone graft on days 14 and 28, but on day 56, bone density was significantly higher within the BMG-treated group. Similar to the present study, intra-treatment evaluation of bone formation in each group showed that bone density significantly increased during treatment, and bone fill in BMG group reached significance at every point in time. However, bone fill in the autogenous bone graft group only significantly increased from day 28 to 56 [</offsets><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18475" xml_f="18477" txt_i="13405" txt_f="13407">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18484" xml_f="18487" txt_i="13407" txt_f="13410">]. </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18494" xml_f="18831" txt_i="13411" txt_f="13748">Many authors have confirmed successful defect reconstruction using demineralized bone matrix or BMG, which contains many bone constructing factors such as BMP, but one study showed that producing human BMG to avoid bioincompatibility seems to be the next step for future studies to open a new horizon in the construction of bone defects.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18838" xml_f="19407" txt_i="13749" txt_f="14318">As a result of this study, BMG is an appropriate treatment option for the repair of bone defects that remain after surgery. The newly formed bone in the BMG implanted sites was not limited to the surface of the implanted gelatin; the new synthesized bone progressively extended in a vertical dimension along a net-like structure of BMG, which resulted in more formation of new bone. Moreover, BMG induced formation of bone trabeculae in close approximation to native bone so that it was difficult to distinguish between the implanted material and the newly formed bone.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19414" xml_f="19845" txt_i="14319" txt_f="14750">In conclusion, though limited by a small number of subjects, the results of this study demonstrated that the BMG had striking effect on new bone formation for the insertion of dental implants. The rate of bone reconstruction using BMG is higher than that for autograft and the quality is almost similar to normal tissue. In some cases, bone resulting from BMG has a better quality so that its density is more than the natural bone.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
