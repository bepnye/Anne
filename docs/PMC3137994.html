This is a prospective clinical study of  consecutive patients with Subarachnoid Haemorrhage (SAH) admitted to the Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad during the period  from  2005 to 2009.  The initial diagnosis and investigations were carried out by  neurologists.  The patients were divided into two groups. One received surgical treatment whilst the other group was managed medically.  The decision as to the choice of the method of treatment  was made by the neurosurgeons. The initial medical treatment was standardised for all the patients.

Unfortunately, in Iran many patients with SAH are admitted to hospitals without facilities for catheter angiography, aneurysmal coiling, or direct aneurysmal surgery. Even in tertiary care hospitals with these facilities, many of the SAH patients are admitted after 3 days following the ictus, and for this reason the surgical or endovascular treatment is delayed for up to 3 weeks after event. Unfortunately, there is no policy of urgency in the Iranian emergency departments to direct the patients with SAH to appropriate management. Additionally, some of the Iranian SAH patients refuse surgery on cultural or economic grounds. In this paper, we report the first prospective study of aneurysmal surgery in patients with SAH in Iran.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title><offsets xml_i="6905" xml_f="6928" txt_i="3371" txt_f="3394">2.

SAH patients who died before arriving to hospital were excluded from this study.

Catheter cerebral angiography is a routine diagnostic investigation in our SAH patients and is performed by general radiologists. SAH patients with an initially normal cerebral angiography usually underwent a second angiography after 3 weeks. Patients who did not have cerebral angiography due to poor medical condition, early death in hospital, or allergy to contrast material were excluded. Positive angiograms for aneurysm were found in 63.5% of our SAH patients. SAH patients were usually admitted for 3 weeks in either neurology or neurosurgery divisions. In our center, cerebral angiography followed by aneurysmal clipping is usually performed on patients with SAH within the first 72 hours after SAH. Patients who arrive to hospital after this time or were initially comatose were usually medically treated, and diagnostic procedures and surgery, if required, were performed in this group of cases after 3 weeks after event. SAH patients who underwent craniotomy and aneurysmal clipping were categorized as a surgical therapeutic group. Aneurysmal clipping with the aid of a microscope is the usual type of surgical procedure in our hospital for these patients. Aneurysmal wrapping is not performed and endovascular coiling is not available. Patients who underwent ventricular shunting for hydrocephalus without aneurysmal clipping were included in the medical therapeutic group. Surgical decision for the patient with aneurysm was made by a neurosurgeon. General medical condition of the patients was assessed by anesthetists and patients with poor cardiopulmonary or medical condition were excluded. SAH patients with Hunt and Hess scale of 5 were also excluded. Despite neurosurgical recommendation, some of our patients refused surgery due to cultural aspects or lack of funds. The medical management received was standardized in both surgical and medical groups of SAH patients.

Management of SAH patients in Iran is still suffering from major difficulties.
