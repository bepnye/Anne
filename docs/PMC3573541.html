Good prenatal care with proper nutrition and medical supervision has gone a long way in reducing infant and maternal mortality in both developed and developing countries. The complications in high-risk pregnancies include premature labor, intrauterine growth restriction, pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), pre-eclampsia (PE), eclampsia, thrombocytopenia, and so on. Several markers have been identified that have a predictive value and are included in antenatal screening for prevention of these complications. Studies point to serum uric acid as one such marker, as hyperuricemia is associated with PIH or pre-eclampsia / eclampsia. It has been shown that women with hyperuricemia, combined with gestational hypertension, were more disposed to having a shorter gestation period, smaller birth weight, and an increased risk of pre-term or pre-mature labor.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1"><offsets xml_i="6815" xml_f="6816" txt_i="2885" txt_f="2886">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6823" xml_f="7020" txt_i="2886" txt_f="3083">] Normally a small quantity of uric acid (3.0–7.0 mg/dL) is produced, which serves as a strong antioxidant and a strong reducing substance.

The Shapiro Wilk's Test was used to test the normality of the data. As the data were normally distributed, group time interaction was checked by using repeated measures ANOVA. Between and within groups, comparisons were done using post hoc analysis with Bonferroni corrections. Subgroup analysis on the number of subjects was done by the Chi square test. Absolute risk reduction (RR = control event rate – experimental event rate) and number needed to treat (NNT = 1/Control event rate-Experimental Event Rate) for the events of HT and PIH in yoga and control groups were also calculated.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title><offsets xml_i="17029" xml_f="17036" txt_i="11447" txt_f="11454">RESULTS</offsets></title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="17077" xml_f="17085" txt_i="11455" txt_f="11463">Figure 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17092" xml_f="17948" txt_i="11463" txt_f="12319"> shows the trial profile.

However, as there were no checks to supervise the patient, the possibility of lack of adherence (although our team made regular phone calls) could not be ruled out.
