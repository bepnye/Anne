Recruitment of patients into the trial was more difficult than expected. We estimated the highest recruitment rate from Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC). However, about halfway through the trial, we had only recruited 177 women instead of an estimated 375. To understand this low recruitment rate, we initiated the current study to find strategies to avoid the major reasons for non-participation which could be implemented during the second half of the study or later in other studies in reproductive medicine.

If the women refused to participate in the trial, the reason for non-participation was recorded. A computer-based 1:1 ratio randomization procedure was used to allocate the women into two groups; the HSG group or the laparoscopy group. Informed consent was obtained from all women.

However, discussing the clinical relevance of the question as well as practical issues in the period that the protocol of the trial was designed appeared to be essential in the prevention of barriers in clinical recruitment [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="14283" xml_f="14284" txt_i="8324" txt_f="8325">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14291" xml_f="14293" txt_i="8325" txt_f="8327">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14300" xml_f="14839" txt_i="8328" txt_f="8867">Apprehensiveness towards one of the diagnostic procedures in this trial (laparoscopy) was mentioned by the women as the most prominent and avoidable reason for non-participation in the trial. General anesthesia prior to laparoscopy appeared to be a main obstacle for enrolment in the trial. Providing more adequate information on the actual procedure and using layman's terms may improve the rate of participation in such a trial. Although well educated and employed persons were more likely to refuse randomization because of preference [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="14870" xml_f="14871" txt_i="8867" txt_f="8868">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14878" xml_f="15289" txt_i="8868" txt_f="9279">], we think that providing more information focused on problems that may emerge from questionnaires disseminated among potential participants in the development of the trial, may optimize recruitment. Some patients did not wish to be involved in a research project. Once patients have made up their mind and once they have prepared a distinct preference, it is nearly impossible to persuade them for enrolment [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="15320" xml_f="15321" txt_i="9279" txt_f="9280">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15328" xml_f="15330" txt_i="9280" txt_f="9282">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15337" xml_f="16222" txt_i="9283" txt_f="10168">One shortcoming of our paper is that we studied the major reasons of non-participation of potentially eligible participants visiting only one hospital. Unavoidable reasons of non-recruitment accounted for three quarters of the non-participation. The exclusion factor might be higher in an academic centre due to specific criteria for referrals. The referred subfertile couples could have been older, with severe androgenic pathology or proven tubal pathology needing specialized assisted reproductive treatments. Another objective of this study was to find strategies to avoid the major reasons for non-participation which could be implemented during the second half of the study or later in other studies focusing on reproductive medicine. We assume that the major avoidable reasons of non-participation (like trial refusal) would be equally divided among all participating hospitals.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16229" xml_f="16335" txt_i="10169" txt_f="10275">Planning for recruitment should be an important issue in the preparation period when a trial is designed [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="16366" xml_f="16367" txt_i="10275" txt_f="10276">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16374" xml_f="16375" txt_i="10276" txt_f="10277">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="16406" xml_f="16407" txt_i="10277" txt_f="10278">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16414" xml_f="16968" txt_i="10278" txt_f="10832">]. Attention can also be paid to logistic problems that patients may encounter. To minimize the no-show, reminder notes and telephone calls may remind patients to attend the clinic. A member of the research team, who can provide the information on a low profile with a high level of communication skills and understanding, can support the investigators. This person can deal with practical problems, such as patient's concerns or language barriers.

To overcome the remaining avoidable reasons for non-participation and to increase external validity of a trial, it may be contingent upon tracing reasons of clinicians and patients for non-participation as well as by anticipating practical problems that clinicians and patients may encounter during a trial. In the set up of the trial and during the recruitment, communication and information are the key words.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17606" xml_f="17625" txt_i="11382" txt_f="11401">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17636" xml_f="17696" txt_i="11402" txt_f="11462">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17718" xml_f="17740" txt_i="11464" txt_f="11486">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17751" xml_f="18092" txt_i="11487" txt_f="11828">DAMP participated in the design of the study, collected and analyzed the data and wrote the first draft.
