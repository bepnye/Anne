Healthcare personnel were randomized to wear either long- or short-sleeved white coats while examining a mannequin contaminated with cauliflower mosaic virus DNA followed by examination of an uncontaminated mannequin. We compared the frequency of transfer of the DNA marker with the sleeves and/or wrists and with the uncontaminated mannequin. During work rounds, physicians were observed to determine how often the sleeves of white coats contacted patients or the environment.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s3"><title><offsets xml_i="5681" xml_f="5688" txt_i="1050" txt_f="1057">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5699" xml_f="6321" txt_i="1058" txt_f="1680">During work rounds and simulated examinations, the sleeve cuff of long-sleeved coats frequently contacted the patient/mannequin or environment. Contamination with the DNA marker was detected significantly more often on the sleeves and/or wrists when personnel wore long- vs short-sleeved coats (5 of 20, 25% vs 0 of 20, 0%; P = 0.02). In one of five (20%) instances of sleeve and/or wrist contamination, the DNA marker was transferred to the second mannequin. It was also observed that healthcare personnel were less likely to include their wrist in handwashing between simulations if they were wearing long-sleeved coats.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s4"><title><offsets xml_i="6351" xml_f="6361" txt_i="1682" txt_f="1692">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6372" xml_f="6677" txt_i="1693" txt_f="1998">During simulations of patient care, the sleeve cuff of long-sleeved white coats frequently became contaminated with a viral DNA marker that could be transferred. These results provide support for the recommendation that healthcare personnel wear short sleeves to reduce the risk for pathogen transmission.</offsets></p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx162_IF0058"></graphic></fig></sec><sec id="s5"><title><offsets xml_i="6837" xml_f="6848" txt_i="2000" txt_f="2011">Disclosures</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6859" xml_f="6860" txt_i="2012" txt_f="2013">
