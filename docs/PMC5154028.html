In consonance with the goals of palliative care, the primary aim of music therapy is to improve people’s quality of life by addressing their psychological needs and facilitating communication. To date, primarily because of a paucity of robust research, the evidence for music therapy’s effectiveness on patient reported outcomes is positive but weak. This pilot and feasibility study will test procedures, outcomes and validated tools; estimate recruitment and attrition rates; and calculate the sample size required for a phase III randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness of music therapy in improving the quality of life of palliative care patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6072" xml_f="6079" txt_i="740" txt_f="747">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6090" xml_f="7236" txt_i="748" txt_f="1891">A pilot randomised controlled trial supplemented with qualitative methods.

Eligibility criteria include all patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 03− indicating they are medically fit to engage with music therapy and an Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) score of ≥7 indicating they are capable of providing meaningful informed consent and accurate responses to outcome measures. Baseline data collection will include the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL); medical and socio-demographic data will be undertaken before randomisation to an intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention arm will be offered two 30–45 min sessions of music therapy per week for three consecutive weeks, in addition to care as usual. Participants in the control arm will receive care as usual. Follow-up measures will be administered in 1, 3 and 5 weeks.

Findings from the feasibility components will also help ascertain if the instruments for measuring the outcomes constitute an acceptable burden for participants and whether attrition affects the viability of an intervention of 3 weeks duration. If music therapy is found to be effective for improving the quality of life of palliative care patients in a subsequent phase III RCT, this finding will provide support for NHS and third sector specialist palliative care commissioners and service providers to make an evidence-based decision on whether to incorporate music therapy in palliative care services, with patients as beneficiaries.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38694" xml_f="39068" txt_i="28781" txt_f="29155">For this study, anticipated challenges include generating and maintaining enthusiasm among practitioners referring potential patients to the study.
