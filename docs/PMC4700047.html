Based on early evidence of effectiveness, the trial steering committee recommended on Oct 13, 2014, that all deferred participants be offered PrEP. Follow-up for HIV incidence was complete for 243 (94%) of 259 patient-years in the immediate group versus 222 (90%) of 245 patient-years in the deferred group. Three HIV infections occurred in the immediate group (1·2/100 person-years) versus 20 in the deferred group (9·0/100 person-years) despite 174 prescriptions of post-exposure prophylaxis in the deferred group (relative reduction 86%, 90% CI 64–96, p=0·0001; absolute difference 7·8/100 person-years, 90% CI 4·3–11·3). 13 men (90% CI 9–23) in a similar population would need access to 1 year of PrEP to avert one HIV infection. We recorded no serious adverse drug reactions; 28 adverse events, most commonly nausea, headache, and arthralgia, resulted in interruption of PrEp. We detected no difference in the occurrence of sexually transmitted infections, including rectal gonorrhoea and chlamydia, between groups, despite a suggestion of risk compensation among some PrEP recipients.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="12351" xml_f="12365" txt_i="2444" txt_f="2458">Interpretation</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12376" xml_f="12812" txt_i="2459" txt_f="2895">In this high incidence population, daily tenofovir–emtricitabine conferred even higher protection against HIV than in placebo-controlled trials, refuting concerns that effectiveness would be less in a real-world setting.

As it emerged that HIV incidence was much higher than anticipated, an independent data monitoring committee was set up in June, 2014. The committee regarded the difference between groups in rate of HIV infection (rate difference) as the key measure for public health policy, and adopted a lower 2·5% confidence limit greater than two infections per 100 person-years as a threshold for notifying the steering committee, although this was not a formal stopping rule.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25922" xml_f="26436" txt_i="14220" txt_f="14734">Analyses included all participants according to their randomised allocation (intention to treat) apart from the exclusion of individuals with a reactive HIV antigen–antibody result at enrolment in analyses of HIV incidence (modified intention to treat).

However, we were able to use the information in the routine clinic records to capture the results of screens for HIV and sexually transmitted infection in the study database, and achieve a high level of follow-up for these endpoints. A larger study would have given more precise estimates of the effect of PrEP on sexually transmitted infections. Third, two men enrolled twice to access PrEP, and it is possible that others in the deferred group co-enrolled without detection or accessed PrEP from other sources, resulting in the effectiveness of PrEP being underestimated.

Despite the broad eligibility criteria and extensive use of post-exposure prophylaxis, we recorded a high HIV incidence of nine cases per 100 person-years in the deferred group. This finding was the main determinant of the highly favourable estimate of 13 similar men who would need access to PrEP for 1 year to avert one HIV infection. Additional infections that would have occurred further down the transmission chain are not represented in this value. The incidence was roughly seven times higher than the national estimate of 1·34 cases per 100 person-years reported for men who have sex with men attending sexual health clinics in 2012, derived from avidity assay data.</offsets><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="38808" xml_f="38810" txt_i="25710" txt_f="25712">25</offsets></sup></xref><offsets xml_i="38823" xml_f="39043" txt_i="25712" txt_f="25932"> Although participants in PROUD were much more likely to have had rectal infections and to have used post-exposure prophylaxis than was the overall population of men who have sex with men attending sexual health clinics,</offsets><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="39082" xml_f="39084" txt_i="25932" txt_f="25934">26</offsets></sup></xref><offsets xml_i="39097" xml_f="39500" txt_i="25934" txt_f="26337"> the size of the difference in HIV incidence was nonetheless surprising.

Nonetheless, there remains a substantial burden of new HIV diagnoses in men who have sex with men already attending sexual health clinics and thus accessing this standard of prevention. The impressive reduction in HIV incidence in people taking PrEP, without a measurable increase in other sexually transmitted infections, is reassuring for clinical, community, and public health stakeholders. National health services are under financial constraints, but they cannot afford to ignore the results of PROUD and IPERGAY, which strongly support the addition of PrEP to the current standard of prevention for men who have sex with men at risk of HIV infection.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="oref10">Public Health England.
