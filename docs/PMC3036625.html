Two of the most at risk female minority groups are American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) and Latinas. American Indian women have the poorest recorded 5-year cancer survival rates of any ethnic group while breast cancer is the number one cause of cancer mortality among Latina women. Breast cancer screening rates for both minority groups are near or at the lowest among all racial/ethnic groups. As with other health screening behaviors, women may intend to get a mammogram but their intentions may not result in initiation or follow through of the examination process. An accumulating body of research, however, demonstrates the efficacy of developing 'implementation intentions' that define when, where, and how a specific behavior will be performed. The formulation of intended steps in addition to addressing potential barriers to test completion can increase a person's self-efficacy, operationalize and strengthen their intention to act, and close gaps between behavioral intention and completion. To date, an evaluation of the formulation of implementation intentions for breast cancer screening has not been conducted with minority populations.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6585" xml_f="6599" txt_i="1347" txt_f="1361">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6610" xml_f="6890" txt_i="1362" txt_f="1642">In the proposed program, community health workers will meet with rural-dwelling Latina and American Indian women one-on-one to educate them about breast cancer and screening and guide them through a computerized and culturally tailored "implementation intentions" program, called </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="6898" xml_f="6935" txt_i="1642" txt_f="1679">Healthy Living Kansas - Breast Health</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="6944" xml_f="7219" txt_i="1679" txt_f="1954">, to promote breast cancer screening utilization.

In the second stage, people become aware but are not yet at a point where they are actively considering the precautionary behavior. An individual in this stage lacks engagement due to inadequate personal relevance. Perceived susceptibility is presumed to be important at this stage. If, and when, people become engaged in the issue, they progress to a decision-making phase (Stage 3). Self-efficacy, barriers, and any prior experience with the screening test might be important in this decisional stage. Decision-making can result in a decision not to act (Stage 4) or a decision to act (Stage 5). However, deciding to act is not the final step in the process.

For breast cancer, the decision to get screened may be separate from the decision of where to go to obtain screening services. Multiple steps are clearly involved in following through with test scheduling, completion, and follow-up. Our proposed project will explore and define these constructs as they apply to breast cancer prevention; the culturally sensitive intervention will test the model and its assumptions, and a 120-day

If they are unsure or do not intend to get screened within the next 120 days, they will be taken through a series of implementation intention questions that specifically address when, where, and how they will gather more information on breast cancer screening or engage in discussions about breast cancer screening with their physician, family, or peer group. Individuals intending to receive screening will be led through a series of questions about when, where, and how they will be screened. The questions will include specifics on making contacts with the health care system, obtaining authorizations from health care providers, scheduling appointments, arranging for transportation to mammography locations, and avoiding potential behavioral pitfalls along each juncture of the aforementioned process. All implementation intention questions will be tailored to the race/ethnicity of the participant. The HLK-BH program also will provide suggestions that might help the participant overcome obstacles to test completion (inconvenience, pain, embarrassment). To assist persons with low literacy levels, the computer program will evaluate and organize data as they are entered and then deliver a tailored intervention message using video clips and narrated graphics.

Sheeran and Orbell found the implementation intention intervention to increase cervical cancer screening attendance by 23% compared with a control group. Another recent study to assess the effect of implementation intentions on testicular self examination (TSE) in men found a 25% increase in self-reported TSE vs. a no intervention group. Both studies represent substantial behavioral changes resulting from implementation intentions-based interventions. Based on these studies, we would anticipate a similar increase in breast cancer screening in a general population. However, the participants who will be randomized into one of the proposed study arms represent traditionally underserved rural minority women whose access to mammography services may be hampered. Thus, we would expect for it to be more difficult to alter their breast cancer screening behavior. Nonetheless, based on the aforementioned assumptions, we anticipate a 25% increase in CRC screening rates for </offsets><bold><offsets xml_i="85024" xml_f="85026" txt_i="68807" txt_f="68809">MI</offsets></bold><sup><bold><offsets xml_i="85044" xml_f="85046" txt_i="68809" txt_f="68811">2 </offsets></bold></sup><offsets xml_i="85059" xml_f="85131" txt_i="68811" txt_f="68883">participants versus a 10% increase in breast cancer screening rates for </offsets><bold><offsets xml_i="85137" xml_f="85139" txt_i="68883" txt_f="68885">C </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="85146" xml_f="85159" txt_i="68885" txt_f="68898">participants.</offsets></p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="85193" xml_f="85203" txt_i="68902" txt_f="68912">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="85214" xml_f="87097" txt_i="68913" txt_f="70796">In the U.S., women from Hispanic or American Indian/Alaskan Native racial/ethnic backgrounds have disproportionately low breast cancer screening rates. Later stage cancers also have been found among persons living in rural communities. Not unlike other states, Kansas has seen recent unprecedented growth of underserved rural Latino and American Indian communities. Simple 'one size fits all' programs to overcome barriers to breast cancer screening are likely not to be effective within these communities given their diverse cultures and unique mammography access issues. To be maximally effective, programs to promote breast cancer screening in these communities will need to be culturally relevant, pertinent to the specific concerns of individual community members, and provide clear direction regarding steps that advance program participants towards their intended goal. There is good empirical evidence to suggest that a program with implementation intention components (e.g., one that lays out the where, how, and when steps to screening) will be an effective method for addressing breast cancer screening underutilization. In this study, we propose to test such an 'implementation intentions' based method that is firmly seated in health behavior theory, culturally relevant, community specific, and guided and introduced by Latina and AI/AN community health workers in two distinct rural communities. The conduct of this study will move us forward in our understanding of how best to improve breast cancer screening utilization among underserved minority and rural-dwelling individuals. This type of intervention also is significant in that it is generalizable to organizations such as health plans or existing 1-800 cancer information telephone programs that have the capacity to adopt similar telephone-based counseling procedures to promote cancer screening utilization.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="87119" xml_f="87138" txt_i="70798" txt_f="70817">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="87149" xml_f="87207" txt_i="70818" txt_f="70876">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="87229" xml_f="87251" txt_i="70878" txt_f="70900">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="87262" xml_f="87775" txt_i="70901" txt_f="71414">KKE, KAG, and EFE contributed to the design of the study and identified the research questions and hypotheses.
