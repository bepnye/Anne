Cannabis preparations were packaged at PPS in 30 gram bags and labeled as Presentation # 1 to Presentation # 4 prior to shipment to the site pharmacy. The site pharmacist weighed 1 g quantities of each preparation (LP 3200D scale, Sartorius, Canada). The drug was repackaged in plastic vials closed with a soft plastic/rubber top, which were then dispensed to the study nurse as needed on the days of use. The product was weighed and transferred from the original package to the dispensing container within 5 minutes, and the ambient temperature and humidity conditions in the pharmacy were recorded at the time of preparation (Digital Hygrometer DHM-010, Davidoff, Canada).

An overall comparison to usual cannabis was made (0: much worse than usual cannabis; 4: much better that usual cannabis).

Informed consent was signed at the first appointment. The subjects were randomly assigned to test one cannabis preparation per day over the four days. They were asked to assess physical characteristics of the drug prior to use. They were asked to prepare and use the cannabis in the manner to which they were accustomed. Within five minutes of use they were asked to comment on the harshness, hotness, burn rate and comparison with usual cannabis. Subjects remained in the cannabis laboratory for one hour after use before being allowed to return home by taxi.

This number of subjects was also feasible to recruit within the time period of the study. The data were double entered and validated in a dedicated and secure database. Data were entered without identifiers to protect confidentiality. Cannabis preparations were ranked according to user preferences on each item. All items were rated equally. A total rank score for each preparation was assigned. Ranks according to individual physical and smoking characteristics were examined. All statistical analyses were done using SAS (SAS Institute, North Carolina). Means, frequencies and a multiple analysis of variance (ANOVA) for cross-over design (proc mixed) were calculated to assess the comparison between products. Period effect was analyzed independently.

The small sample size reduces the power of the study to reach definitive conclusions about patient preference.

The average ambient humidity at the time of product preparation was well above that of the original product specifications (46% versus 10â15%), and could have raised the humidity of the product during the storage period prior to use. This would have the effect of reducing or eliminating the potential differences between products on humidity-based assessments. This may partially explain why differences in physical characteristics such as colour, particle size and general appearance were detected (Table 2), while the hotness, harshness and burn rate appeared to be rated similarly between products.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21524" xml_f="21875" txt_i="14454" txt_f="14805">Subjects' evaluations of smoking characteristics of the samples immediately after use may have been influenced by the psychoactive effects of cannabis.

Product 3, which was a 10% THC blend (expiry date June 2004) which had been originally shipped by Health Canada to authorized patients was rated poorly by the subjects in this study, suggesting that the product could be improved by changing physical characteristics such as blending, particle size and humidity. These changes may result in improved patient satisfaction with the product, which may in turn increase the number of patients willing to use the Health Canada product and improve compliance in long term studies using the product. The study results support a decision by Health Canada, made prior to the study in May 2004, to distribute a product made only of flowering head material, taking into account preliminary reports from authorized users, with larger grind size, higher humidity and higher THC content.
