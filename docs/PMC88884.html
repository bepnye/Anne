In brief, the students discuss tobacco prevalence data, the short-term effects of tobacco, including smelly clothes, yellow teeth, bad breath, coughing or hacking and difficulty breathing. Additionally, they learn to calculate the costs involved with weekly, monthly and yearly tobacco use, as well as possible alternative ways to spend their money. They also have an interactive discussion about the reasons people start to use tobacco, which focuses on awareness of media/advertising images and peer pressure that they are exposed to. Finally, through the use of tobacco advertisements, they review misperceptions generated in the public at large, and children in particular, related to tobacco use, including â that smoking is related to obtaining â romance, having good looks, attaining a 'cool' image, and making friends. The program is reinforced through the creation of individual posters emphasizing the positive effects of remaining tobacco free.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label><offsets xml_i="11139" xml_f="11146" txt_i="6598" txt_f="6605">Table 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="11166" xml_f="11231" txt_i="6605" txt_f="6670">Overview of the Tar Wars tobacco-free education program for youth</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="11316" xml_f="11325" txt_i="6671" txt_f="6680">Activity:</offsets></bold></td><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="11360" xml_f="11371" txt_i="6681" txt_f="6692">Objectives:</offsets></bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="11424" xml_f="11478" txt_i="6693" txt_f="6747">1. discussion of tobacco use prevalence [pre-activity]</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="11500" xml_f="11541" txt_i="6748" txt_f="6789">review information on the percentage of 4</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="11546" xml_f="11548" txt_i="6789" txt_f="6791">th</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="11554" xml_f="11556" txt_i="6791" txt_f="6793">/5</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="11561" xml_f="11563" txt_i="6793" txt_f="6795">th</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="11569" xml_f="11587" txt_i="6795" txt_f="6813"> grade students, 9</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="11592" xml_f="11594" txt_i="6813" txt_f="6815">th</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="11600" xml_f="11692" txt_i="6815" txt_f="6907"> grade students and adults who are tobacco-free, recognize that most people are tobacco-free</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="11723" xml_f="11759" txt_i="6908" txt_f="6944">2. short term effects of tobacco use</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="11781" xml_f="11967" txt_i="6945" txt_f="7131">discussion of the short-term effects of tobacco use (smelling clothes, yellow teeth, bad breath, cough, burn holes); interactive demonstration of how tobacco smoke decreases lung volumes</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="11998" xml_f="12023" txt_i="7132" txt_f="7157">3. costs of using tobacco</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="12045" xml_f="12124" txt_i="7158" txt_f="7237">calculation of the cost of tobacco use, discussion of alternative uses of money</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="12155" xml_f="12197" txt_i="7238" txt_f="7280">4. reasons why people begin to use tobacco</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="12219" xml_f="12317" txt_i="7281" txt_f="7379">understand reasons why people begin to use tobacco, identify responses when these situations arise</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="12348" xml_f="12374" txt_i="7380" txt_f="7406">5. tobacco and advertising</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="12396" xml_f="12635" txt_i="7407" txt_f="7646">increase students' knowledge of the tobacco industry's marketing strategies (image distortions) and how tobacco advertising attempts to influence product purchase, students begin think critically about tobacco advertisements/misperceptions</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="12666" xml_f="12738" txt_i="7647" txt_f="7719">6. design a poster emphasizing the positive effects of not using tobacco</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="12760" xml_f="12909" txt_i="7720" txt_f="7869">reinforce the Tar Wars lesson, creatively demonstrate individualized integration of curriculum along with prior information on tobacco use prevention</offsets></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><offsets xml_i="12955" xml_f="13023" txt_i="7870" txt_f="7938">Note copies of the program curriculum are available at no charge at </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tarwars.org"></ext-link></p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p><offsets xml_i="13138" xml_f="13431" txt_i="7939" txt_f="8232">Comparisons of tobacco use knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of fifth grade students are made within a randomly assigned (at the level of the school) primary intervention group (study Group 1) across three points in time â 'pre-test', 'immediate post-test', and 'delayed post-test'.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13438" xml_f="13666" txt_i="8233" txt_f="8461">Responses were also compared among children in other randomly assigned groups (Group 2 and Group 3), who took 'pre-tests', the 'intervention', and 'immediate post-tests', but at different points in time than Group 1 (see Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="13696" xml_f="13697" txt_i="8461" txt_f="8462">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13704" xml_f="14170" txt_i="8462" txt_f="8928">).

First, unlike other programs that require multiple sessions and considerable coordination, Tar Wars is a single session, structured, interactive intervention program. These results suggest the presence of modest and sustained responses as a result of this single session. It is possible that these key concepts could be reinforced, and even expanded, through repeated exposures to and participation in other complementary tobacco prevention and health programs. Thus, Tar Wars can contribute as one element among a variety of educational strategies. In addition, the ultimate success of these educational programs requires the implementation of a comprehensive tobacco control strategy, including legislation, taxation, and modification of social norms.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38276" xml_f="38864" txt_i="25544" txt_f="26132">A number of potential limitations warrant discussion. First, in assessing post-intervention changes in knowledge and attitudes, the potential of a ceiling effect among variables with a high level of correct responses at baseline can complicate interpretation. Statistical significance was not achieved for all items showing an increment in correct responses, which may be due in part to a limited number of schools and the choice to complete analyses at the level of the school. The inclusion of additional schools in the analysis would have resulted in significance for additional items.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38871" xml_f="39733" txt_i="26133" txt_f="26995">Because student identities were anonymous, a repeated measures design could not be used. Also, the school groups sampled at the 'delayed post-test" may not contain the same students who completed the 'pre-test', 'intervention', and "immediate post-test' during the Fall of 1998. Also, there was some non-systematic loss of schools in each group that were unable to complete all requested components due to scheduling difficulties and competing demands for classroom time. However, the observed response rates were reasonable given the follow-up interval of several months. Further, these analyses relied upon non-parametric tests at the level of the school. As a result, the median scores for some of individual schools are variable, making the ordering inconsistent over testing occasions, which in turn, results in the extreme p-values from the Wilcoxon tests.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39740" xml_f="40627" txt_i="26996" txt_f="27883">Another potential limitation relates to test/re-test bias. Theoretically, the delay of several months between completion of the baseline survey and the intervention and immediate post-test in Group 2 could be used to examine the potential issue of test-/re-test bias. In using the same survey instrument for the baseline and post-tests we would tend to show an impact from the intervention, where there might not be one. However, delaying the intervention and post-test should create a less pronounced test/re-test bias, if it exists. In other words, we would expect to see a greater increase on the immediate post-test in Group 1. However, a sub-analysis demonstrated no significant differences between Groups 1 and 2 at baseline or on the immediate post-test for any of the ten knowledge and attitude items. Thus, the issue of test/re-test bias does not seem to be a significant issue.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40634" xml_f="41189" txt_i="27884" txt_f="28439">Also, through the comparison of baseline surveys for Groups 1 and 3, we were able to rule out historical effects, that is, the presence of any systematic tobacco programs or policies that might have impacted our dependent variables of knowledge and attitude.

These results, in combination with the aggregate data comparing baseline and immediate post-tests, suggest that Tar Wars is having a positive impact on these children. However, virtually all program components would need to be reinforced through repetition and recall efforts at some identified interval.

These exposures to parallel messages likely reinforce or "boost" the educational impact. Other educational interventions reinforcing the Tar War message of healthful, tobacco-free lifestyles include school health classes, science classes, alternative tobacco use prevention/education programs and community/religious youth groups.

Certainly, the results from this study suggest that a logistically uncomplicated and low cost program such as Tar Wars should be included within the educational armamentarium to aid in preventing youth from using tobacco products.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="47221" xml_f="47240" txt_i="33950" txt_f="33969">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47251" xml_f="47426" txt_i="33970" txt_f="34145">Dr Mahoney previously served as a former member and Chair of the Tar Wars Advisory Board, American Academy of Family Physicians He continues as a Program Advisor for Tar Wars.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="47448" xml_f="47471" txt_i="34147" txt_f="34170">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47482" xml_f="47546" txt_i="34171" txt_f="34235">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2296/3/3/prepub"></ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This study was supported in part by a grant from the American Academy of Family Physicians.
