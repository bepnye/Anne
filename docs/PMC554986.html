Applying this equipment would be as simple as providing medication prior to the dressing change procedure. The equipment is reusable and requires minimal technical knowledge for use. Provided a number of different games were available to cater for different age groups, it could be widely applied, and will allow children to relocate themselves to 'another world' during dressing changes, decreasing their attention to painful stimuli. It was noted by nurses during several trials that communication was never a problem; they were able to instruct the child to change, or assist change in position without any difficulty in a compliant and relatively pain-free manner. On the other hand, children without VR were often distressed and crying in pain, decreasing their ability to listen and cooperate.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="27617" xml_f="27628" txt_i="20862" txt_f="20873">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27639" xml_f="28308" txt_i="20874" txt_f="21543">A number of factors resulted in a small sample size.

Several potentially eligible children (2 trials) had such severe side effects from the medication (particularly drowsiness) that they were not able to participate, and two refused to participate.

The next stage would be to test VR alone against pharmacological pain relief, to investigate whether VR is as effective in isolation, and could decrease use of analgesia, thus avoiding the side effects associated with medication. Another avenue of future research would be to investigate the exact mechanisms by which VR assists pain modulation. It is hypothesized that it works by distracting a child's attention from painful stimuli, which in turn reduces the perceived intensity of pain.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="29827" xml_f="29846" txt_i="22995" txt_f="23014">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29857" xml_f="29916" txt_i="23015" txt_f="23074">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="29938" xml_f="29960" txt_i="23076" txt_f="23098">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29971" xml_f="30733" txt_i="23099" txt_f="23861">DAD was involved with coordination and recruitment of trial  subjects, application of the trial, collection of data and writing up  the paper.
