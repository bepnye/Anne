In both studies a relevant proportion of men even showed a decrease of PSA serum levels due to consumption of PJ (15% and 13%). An on-going phase III study (NCT00413530) is examining whether the pomegranate liquid extract prolongs PSADT in patients who have rising serum PSA levels after primary therapy for localized prostate cancer. That randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an estimated enrollment of 200 patients was scheduled to close on December 2012. All of the above studies have focused on the role of PJ in patients with early biochemical failure after initial treatment.

Group A received 500 ml placebo juice per day and Group B 500 ml of PJ (equivalent to 1147 mg polyphenol gallic acid) per day. PSA serum levels were measured the day before treatment started, and on days 14 and 28. Patients were given a diary to document their daily juice intake, any adverse events and their pain score with time and date. The intensity of pain was self-documented by the previously instructed patients by choosing a value from a non-linear scale (range 0-10). At day 29 patients entered the open label phase of the trial. In this second period of the study, 250 ml of PJ (equivalent to 573 mg polyphenol gallic acid) was consumed by all patients (bottles labelled C) and the diaries were continued as before. A final PSA serum value was taken on day 56. While on study, especially in the first period, patients were not informed about their current PSA values. No other diagnostics, e.g. CT-scans or laboratory values were part of this study. The relatively short observational period of 8 weeks was chosen because the projected patient collective often converts from watchful waiting to intervention due to disease progression.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="13539" xml_f="13548" txt_i="7330" txt_f="7339">Treatment</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="13559" xml_f="13967" txt_i="7340" txt_f="7748">Block randomization (block size 4) was used to assign patients to the treatment groups 500 ml PJ or placebo daily.

There were no significant differences with regard to PSA levels or pain intensity between the observed groups in this trial. The study design included two treatment periods: Initially, patients were randomized to placebo (group A) or pomegranate juice consumption (group B). The results from the double-blinded, randomized controlled part of the study show no differences with regard to PSA level rise or decline, pain, frequency of dropout or adverse effects. The fact that 35% of men in the control group and 25% in the intervention group had a decline in their PSA value during the first phase of the study is remarkable. A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be a natural fluctuation of serum PSA levels in a four-week period in men with advanced prostate cancer that has not been recorded to this extend until now. The latter is particularly important when interpreting results from earlier and on-going studies that report on declining PSA levels due to specific interventions. An alternative explanation for the high percentage of men experiencing a PSA decline in both groups could be an unanticipated PSA test-to-test variability. With regard to this, an intermediate PSA level measurement had been predefined in the study at day 14. The majority of PSA levels obtained at day 14 and at day 28 were in accordance with the individual PSA course, e.g. if day 14 and 28 values were not pointing in the same direction, no more than a 10% difference of the day 14 value versus one of the other values was observed. Furthermore, test variability was controlled by processing all individual blood samples at the enrolling institution. Thus, there was no variability regarding the test used or the laboratory where the set of four patient's samples was analyzed. We conclude that test instability did not influence the final results. Another factor in this study that might have had an impact on patients with declining PSA values regardless of their group was the controlled intake of 500 ml of fluids (either pomegranate juice or placebo) in addition to other daily fluids. In the absence of a non-interventional control this influence cannot be ruled out. Regarding the value of pomegranate in the setting of advanced prostate cancer this variable plays no role as it appeared in both groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25377" xml_f="25696" txt_i="18178" txt_f="18497">Due to the design of a verum-containing treatment period for all patients (second part of the trial) we were able to analyze PSA levels of all men who started with placebo in comparison to the PSA levels after a subsequent four-week consumption phase of 250 ml of PJ, equivalent to 573 mg/ml phenol gallic acids (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"><offsets xml_i="25728" xml_f="25729" txt_i="18497" txt_f="18498">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25736" xml_f="26044" txt_i="18498" txt_f="18806">A placebo day 1-28 versus placebo day 28-56 panel).

The major difference of the studies is that the two previously reported studies in early prostate cancer patients focussed on PSADT and had longer observational periods.

Our study included patients with more advanced disease and higher PSA values (median 19.7 ng/ml). These patients are often to start their next therapy within a short period of time. Thus, these patients cannot be observed for an extended time period. Hence, PSADT would not have been a good end point.

Metastatic status was derived from previous clinical reports. Data concerning initial metastases (M1 at operation) was available in 58% (A) and 69% (B) of patients. The apparent imbalance could be due to under-diagnosing or under-reporting in the placebo group. Further supporting this notion is the fact that the average entry PSA level showed no difference with a median of 19 ng/ml (mean 90) in the placebo group and a median of 21 ng/ml (mean 60) in the interventional arm.
