Exercise studies may be attractive to those who least need them; additional screening measures can be employed to avoid assessment of ineligible participants. Enrolment of peer mentors for intervention support is challenging and needs to be separately tested for feasibility. Standardisation of exercise interventions is problematic when exercise programmes are tailored to participants’ capabilities; quality assurance observations may assure fidelity of the intervention. Data collection by diaries can be burdensome to participants, resulting in variable and incomplete data capture; compromises in completion frequency may reduce missing data. Risk assessments are essential in exercise promotion studies, but categorisation of risks can vary between assessors; methods for their standardisation can be developed.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8064" xml_f="8082" txt_i="2857" txt_f="2875">Trial registration</offsets></title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN47057820/proact65%2B"><offsets xml_i="8196" xml_f="8210" txt_i="2876" txt_f="2890">ISRCTN43453770</offsets></ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>General practice</kwd><kwd>Recruitment</kwd><kwd>Adverse events</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Peer mentors</kwd><kwd>Postural stability instructors</kwd><kwd>Data collection</kwd><kwd>Quality assurance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8555" xml_f="8561" txt_i="2899" txt_f="2905">Update</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8581" xml_f="8591" txt_i="2906" txt_f="2916">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8602" xml_f="8923" txt_i="2917" txt_f="3238">The ProAct65+ trial is a three-arm parallel design cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of class-based exercises (Falls Management Exercise (FaME)), home-based exercises (Otago Exercise Programme (OEP)) facilitated by peer mentors, and usual care among people aged 65 years and over recruited from general practice [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="8954" xml_f="8955" txt_i="3238" txt_f="3239">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8962" xml_f="9211" txt_i="3239" txt_f="3488">].

To reduce the numbers excluded at baseline assessment, patient telephone screening prior to this initial assessment was introduced. Due to low recruitment and enrolment of peer mentors in the OEP arm the criteria for their recruitment and the intensity of their role were changed. A quality control system was incorporated into the FaME arm to aid standardisation of class activities. To reduce the burden of diary completion and optimise data collection on falls, service use and costs, the number of diaries during the follow-up period was reduced. To ensure governance of risks to participants an adverse event typology was developed and a system for checking it was applied consistently between sites.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10787" xml_f="10982" txt_i="4970" txt_f="5165">The knowledge gained during the ProAct65+ trial and the modifications to its protocol may inform both future exercise trials and public health interventions with older people in general practice.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11004" xml_f="11053" txt_i="5167" txt_f="5216">Recruitment of general practices and participants</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11064" xml_f="11137" txt_i="5217" txt_f="5290">The flow path of participant recruitment to the trial is shown in Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="11167" xml_f="11168" txt_i="5290" txt_f="5291">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11175" xml_f="11415" txt_i="5291" txt_f="5531">.

The proportion of those who expressed an interest varied between practices, from 8% to 19% in London and 7% to 21% in Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire, with a mean of 13.4%. Reminder postal invitations were considered to increase the expression of interest rate. Due to time constraints within the general practices however, reminder invitations were only posted from three practices in London and 11 practices in Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire. An additional recruitment method of displaying posters in general practices was considered, however it was not implemented to avoid complicating selection biases among participants. In order to achieve the recruitment target, the number of invitations to eligible patients was increased to 600 from each practice to adjust for the lower than anticipated recruitment rate in practices where 450 were approached. When this change was implemented no change in response was seen (range: 5% to 22% in London, 7% to 26% in Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire), but the number recruited increased due a larger study population being available.</offsets></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="12711" xml_f="12719" txt_i="6749" txt_f="6757">Figure 1</offsets></label><caption><p><bold><offsets xml_i="12745" xml_f="12827" txt_i="6757" txt_f="6839">Flow diagram of participant recruitment after alteration of recruitment processes.</offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="12834" xml_f="12920" txt_i="6839" txt_f="6925"> Percentages refer to proportions in the next higher level of the recruitment process.</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-192-1"></graphic></fig><p><offsets xml_i="12994" xml_f="13324" txt_i="6926" txt_f="7256">Stratified random sampling was planned, whereby eligible patients would be stratified into age groups 65 to 74 years and 75+ years.

In part, this was due to patients who expressed interest in the trial being frequent fallers (three or more falls in the previous 12 months), either already reaching the physical activity target or meeting other exclusion criteria, listed in the trial protocol [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="13916" xml_f="13917" txt_i="7811" txt_f="7812">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13924" xml_f="14396" txt_i="7812" txt_f="8284">]. Additionally, room availability in practices for baseline assessments was limited and it took up to 6 weeks in some practices to assess and recruit the target number of participants.

The aim was to recruit 50 peer mentors at each site, with the expectation that each would mentor four to five participants. Initially peer mentor recruitment was aimed at adults aged 65 years and over. Peer mentors were recruited by displaying posters and flyers in libraries, approaching senior exercise classes, through articles in local newspapers and stories on local radio, by word of mouth from trained volunteers and by invitations in participating general practices.

There is a large difference in the number of people who expressed an interest in becoming a peer mentor and those that were trained; individuals decided whether or not they wanted to join a training session after receiving an information sheet about what the volunteering entailed and learning where they would need to travel to when visiting participants. Feedback from peer mentors suggests that disengagement was due in part to the length of time between training and beginning work. This was due to the time needed to obtain research management and governance approvals for the peer mentors, and for the randomisation of the practices and the start of interventions. Disengagement was also due in part to the distance peer mentors would need to travel to support participants.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label><offsets xml_i="19699" xml_f="19706" txt_i="13056" txt_f="13063">Table 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="19726" xml_f="19775" txt_i="13063" txt_f="13112">Peer mentors recruitment, training and deployment</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><offsets xml_i="19971" xml_f="19972" txt_i="13113" txt_f="13114"> </offsets></th><th align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="20002" xml_f="20008" txt_i="13114" txt_f="13120">London</offsets></bold></th><th align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="20045" xml_f="20071" txt_i="13120" txt_f="13146">Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire</offsets></bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20153" xml_f="20196" txt_i="13146" txt_f="13189">Time spent on recruitment by staff (months)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20245" xml_f="20247" txt_i="13190" txt_f="13192">12</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20296" xml_f="20298" txt_i="13193" txt_f="13195">15</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20354" xml_f="20374" txt_i="13196" txt_f="13216">Expressed interest (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="20382" xml_f="20383" txt_i="13216" txt_f="13217">n</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="20392" xml_f="20393" txt_i="13217" txt_f="13218">)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20442" xml_f="20445" txt_i="13219" txt_f="13222">130</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20494" xml_f="20496" txt_i="13223" txt_f="13225">79</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20552" xml_f="20561" txt_i="13226" txt_f="13235">Trained (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="20569" xml_f="20570" txt_i="13235" txt_f="13236">n</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="20579" xml_f="20580" txt_i="13236" txt_f="13237">)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20629" xml_f="20631" txt_i="13238" txt_f="13240">50</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20680" xml_f="20682" txt_i="13241" txt_f="13243">21</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20738" xml_f="20750" txt_i="13244" txt_f="13256">Disengaged (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="20758" xml_f="20759" txt_i="13256" txt_f="13257">n</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="20768" xml_f="20769" txt_i="13257" txt_f="13258">)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20818" xml_f="20820" txt_i="13259" txt_f="13261">19</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20869" xml_f="20871" txt_i="13262" txt_f="13264">14</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="20927" xml_f="20940" txt_i="13265" txt_f="13278">Volunteered (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="20948" xml_f="20949" txt_i="13278" txt_f="13279">n</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="20958" xml_f="20959" txt_i="13279" txt_f="13280">)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="21008" xml_f="21010" txt_i="13281" txt_f="13283">31</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="21059" xml_f="21060" txt_i="13284" txt_f="13285">7</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="21100" xml_f="21136" txt_i="13286" txt_f="13322">Time from trained to deployed (days)</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="21160" xml_f="21184" txt_i="13323" txt_f="13347">Mean 132 (range, 21-255)</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="21208" xml_f="21232" txt_i="13348" txt_f="13372">Mean 155 (range, 75-257)</offsets></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><offsets xml_i="21278" xml_f="21602" txt_i="13373" txt_f="13697">This table shows the time taken to recruit peer mentors in both trial sites, the numbers of individuals who expressed an interest in becoming a peer mentor, those who were trained, disengaged and volunteered, and the time it took from when peer mentors were trained to when they began their volunteering at both trial sites.</offsets></p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p><offsets xml_i="21640" xml_f="23164" txt_i="13698" txt_f="15219">Each peer mentor in the trial mentored a mean of three participants (range, 1-13) in London, and a mean of three participants (range, 1-5) in Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire. Overall, both sites therefore fell short of the target of four to five participants per peer mentor. All participants, regardless of their peer mentor support, received the initial exercise training session and a booklet with tailored exercise instructions. Not all participants received a peer mentor because of the difficulties recruiting them. In London 123 (53%) participants and in Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire 21 (12%) participants had a peer mentor. Despite using the same recruitment methods, recruitment difficulties were greater in Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire. This may have been because the trial was competing with existing peer mentor physical activity programmes for older people in Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire. Due to the difficulty recruiting sufficient peer mentors for each participant, we debated using either Postural Stability Instructors (PSIs), already working on and familiar with the study, or volunteers aged &lt; 50 years, who would be trained in the delivery of the home based programme. The Trial Steering Committee advised to keep the intervention true to usual practice in the NHS, that is, one instruction session plus a manual of exercises. Therefore, where there were insufficient peer mentors for all participants, they were not supplemented by an alternative person and some participants had no peer mentor support at all.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23171" xml_f="23816" txt_i="15220" txt_f="15865">In another attempt to increase the number of peer mentors and encourage them to support more participants, the number of their supportive contacts with participants was reduced. Initially peer mentors were scheduled to visit participants in their home on four occasions and telephone them 12 times during the 24-week intervention. This was reduced to two visits and eight telephone calls. Over both sites, the number of home visits ranged from zero to five (mean two), and the number of telephone call contacts ranged from zero to 18 (mean six).

PSIs were recruited to lead the classes. The trial aimed to recruit 12 PSIs per site. In London 16 PSIs were recruited with a total of seven working on the trial. As there were few qualified PSIs available to recruit in Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire, the trial recruited and trained physiotherapists and exercise professionals who were interested in becoming a PSI and working on the trial. Sixteen individuals embarked on the PSI training course (15 completed the training), and seven of them worked on the trial. Some PSIs were not employed on the trial due to their limited availability. Additionally the complex and lengthy process of completing research governance approvals resulted in losing some available PSIs.

The initial calculation of mismatches was performed towards the end of the intervention phase, when there were 51 mismatches, giving a mismatch rate between sites of 19%.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33518" xml_f="34003" txt_i="22788" txt_f="23273">The decision on whether an event is ‘Possibly Related’ to the trial is open to subjective interpretation. Consequently, 45 of the 51 (88%) discrepancies in the categorisation of events recorded at each site were between Adverse Events and Adverse Reactions. The category ‘Possible Adverse Reaction’ (Possible AR) was therefore added. After the introduction of the Possible Adverse Reaction category, the mismatch rate (prior to discussion between Principal Investigators) fell to 2.6%.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34010" xml_f="34402" txt_i="23274" txt_f="23666">After advice from the Trial’s Steering Committee, the categorisation was further modified to enable Serious Unrelated Adverse Events to be distinguished from Non-Serious Adverse Events. The final categories applied to the trial’s events were therefore: Serious Adverse Events; Unrelated Serious Adverse Events; Adverse Events; Adverse Reactions; Possible Adverse Reactions; Adverse Incidents.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34430" xml_f="34457" txt_i="23669" txt_f="23696">Discussion and implications</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34468" xml_f="34726" txt_i="23697" txt_f="23955">The challenges faced during the ProAct65+ trial and solutions to these challenges are summarised below.

The lower age limit for peer mentors was reduced, as was the frequency of their contacts with participants, but with only limited benefit. It is important for future interventions to allow enough time and resources (human and financial) when planning peer mentor programmes. In order to minimize the time from training a peer mentor to deployment and to retain interested volunteers, attention needs to be focused on speeding up the process of gaining Criminal Record Bureau checks and Research Management and Governance approvals. Strategies to optimise peer mentor motivation and involvement need further investigation. Additionally, the number of supportive contacts between peer mentors and participants varied and often differed from the number of contacts advised by the research team, which may reflect the needs of the individual participants. Future projects implementing peer mentor support should be aware of participants needs for more or less support, which may lead to varied numbers of contacts with peer mentors.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37812" xml_f="37947" txt_i="26708" txt_f="26843">Failure to ensure the fidelity of interventions is an important source of variation affecting the credibility and utility of research [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="37979" xml_f="37981" txt_i="26843" txt_f="26845">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37988" xml_f="38415" txt_i="26845" txt_f="27272">].
