Baseline vital signs were recorded 5 and 20 minutes after tourniquet inflation, immediately after tourniquet deflation, and during the recovery room period. An intravenous cannula was inserted into the most distal part of the limb to be operated. Also, a separate intravenous cannula was inserted into the other upper limb for the infusion of fluids and injection of other medications. A double tourniquet (Rs3000, Raeen Sanat Co., Tehran, Iran) was fastened on a layer of cotton band, above the elbow of the intended limb. After draining the blood from the extremities by limb elevation and closing tightly with the rubber esmarch band from the fingertips to the elbow, the proximal cuff was inflated approximately 150mm Hg higher than the systolic blood pressure and lack of radial pulse was considered as a sign of sufficient tourniquet pressure. The IVRA local anesthetic solution containing 3 mg/kg lidocaine (2% Lidocaine ampule, Caspian Tamin Pharmaceutical Co., Rasht, Iran) was diluted to a volume of 40 ml using distilled water and injected slowly over 2 minutes. The intervention group received the above anesthetic solution along with 8mg dexamethasone (2 cc Dexamethasone ampule, Darou Pakhsh Pharmaceutical Co., Tehran, Iran). Intra and post-operative assessments and data documentation were carried out by an anesthesiology resident who was unaware of the categories and randomization of the groups. After the injection of the anesthetic solution, the sensory block was separately checked and recorded in the radial, ulnar and median nerve pathways (by pinprick test with needle gauge No. 22) every 30 seconds. In addition, all patients received 2 mg of intravenous midazolam. After the onset of tourniquet pain, the distal cuff that was placed on the numbed skin was inflated and the proximal cuff was deflated. Afterwards, 1 μ/kg fentanyl was administered intravenously in cases of continued pain and NRS above 3, and in the absence of pain relief, the same dose of fentanyl was administrated once again. Time and intake of intraoperative opioid was recorded.

Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32300" xml_f="32763" txt_i="23485" txt_f="23948">Generally, based on the findings and results of the present study, it seems that the addition of dexamethasone to lidocaine anesthetic solution of IVRA not only has no positive effect on the quality of Bier block, but also, it will lead to an increase in postoperative opioid consumption. We recommend not to add dexamethasone to lidocaine for Bier block. Future studies could focus on the use of other adjuvant treatments for lidocaine anesthesia for Bier block.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Hereby, the authors express their thanks to the respected members of the Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Management Research Center, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran, Dr. Elham Boushehri and Mohsen Azad, statistical consultants of this research and respected orthopedic operating room personnel working in Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Bandar Abbas.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1-epj-10-6631"><p>iThenticate screening: August 31, 2017, English editing: February 25, 2018, Quality control: March 12, 2018</p></fn><fn id="fn2-epj-10-6631"><p>This article has been reviewed/commented by three experts</p></fn><fn id="fn3-epj-10-6631"><p><bold>Trial registration:</bold></p><p>The trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.irct.ir">http://www.irct.ir</ext-link>) with the Irct ID: IRCT2016052928158N1.</p></fn><fn id="fn4-epj-10-6631"><p><bold>Funding:</bold></p><p>The authors received financial support from Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences.</p></fn><fn id="fn5-epj-10-6631" fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold></p><p>There is no conflict of interest to be declared.</p></fn><fn id="fn6-epj-10-6631"><p><bold>Authors’ contributions:</bold></p><p>All authors contributed to this project and article equally.
