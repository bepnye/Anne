The key areas explored were reasons for participation, barriers to receiving the intervention, and perception of the intervention process including participants’ initial expectations and reflections. The interviews explored participants’ views on how the PHP sessions took place, the format and frequency of the sessions, the characteristics of the facilitator, the use of handouts and other session materials, and the acceptability of the delivery of the intervention. Each interview lasted approximately 45 min and was conducted in the participant’s preferred language; all the interviews were carried out in the Urdu language. Later these interviews were translated into English. The analysis and coding process was also carried out in English.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title><offsets xml_i="17832" xml_f="17847" txt_i="9931" txt_f="9946">Ethics approval</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17858" xml_f="17939" txt_i="9947" txt_f="10028">The study was approved by the North West Research Ethics Committee (10/H1005/62).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title><offsets xml_i="17971" xml_f="17979" txt_i="10030" txt_f="10038">Analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17990" xml_f="18078" txt_i="10039" txt_f="10127">Interviews were transcribed verbatim, anonymised, and analysed using thematic analysis [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27"><offsets xml_i="18111" xml_f="18113" txt_i="10127" txt_f="10129">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18120" xml_f="18268" txt_i="10129" txt_f="10277">].

An additional strength is the ability to engage depressed women during the postnatal period for up to 6 months, for follow-up assessments, and for interviews. Another strength of the study is the use of bilingual researchers which allowed participants to complete the interviews in their preferred language.

Most of the participants were of first-generation South Asian origin living in England. These participants were generally isolated and faced additional social pressures. Another limitation of this study is the lack of availability of information from mothers who dropped out and did not attend any of the sessions. This information would have contributed to a deeper understanding of the acceptability of PHP intervention. Further limitation of this study is the conservative definition of completers which was 4 or more sessions out of 12 sessions. This is a conservative value because the mean number of sessions was 6. Another limitation of the study is the lack of inquiry into the impact of intimate partner or other forms of family violence on postnatal mental health problems among the participants. The intervention appears not to have focused on empowerment or other rights-based strategies. Since some of the quotes by the participants suggest coercion and control, further studies are required to gain a clearer understanding of these challenges.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title><offsets xml_i="38639" xml_f="38650" txt_i="27713" txt_f="27724">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38661" xml_f="39430" txt_i="27725" txt_f="28494">The results suggest that this culturally-adapted psychological intervention is acceptable to British South Asian women. Furthermore, it appears from this qualitative study that culturally-sensitive psychological interventions can lead to better health outcomes and higher overall satisfaction levels. Interventions targeting postnatal depression in South Asian women should pay particular attention to ways of improving social support, independent coping strategies, involvement of the culturally-sensitive facilitator, language aspects, childcare and transport support, and group discussion techniques. Future research should consider including individual sessions in between group sessions to further improve engagement and perhaps health and social outcomes as well.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests in relation to this study.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors’ contributions</bold></p><p>YM conducted the interviews, carried out the analysis and drafted the manuscript.
