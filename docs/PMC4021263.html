Once secreted, the physical properties of mucins, including their viscosity, are determined by the content of water and bicarbonate in the airway lumen.

Same-day diagnosis may be possible, allowing immediate initiation of treatment. In this study, nebulization with 5 mL of 7% saline for 5 minutes was applied.

Although the results consistently supported the benefits of induced sputum for bacteriological yield, especially in the same-day samples obtained at the clinic visit, this study failed to demonstrate any significant differences, except in the rate of collection of adequate sputum specimens. This is mainly because of the size of the study, low participant numbers and because of a relatively lower rate of culture positivity in patients undergoing SI. We cannot exclude the possibility that airway exposure to high-concentration saline might influence the viability of mycobacteria in respiratory specimens. Mycobacterial culture is important for discriminating nontuberculous mycobacterial infection and for drug-susceptibility tests, so patients with nontuberculous mycobacteria were included in this study.

Needless to say, treatment strategies for nontuberculous mycobacteria are different from those for APTB, but in most cases nontuberculous mycobacterial infection can barely be discriminated clinically or radiologically from APTB. In this study, the third-day samples for AFB smear and culture provided little additional bacteriological yield, with only a 2% increase in confirmed APTB cases. Sampling on two separate days might be sufficient.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23136" xml_f="23555" txt_i="17041" txt_f="17460">In conclusion, to increase the diagnostic yield in a patient with suspected APTB, it is suggested that in a real clinical practice 1) at the clinic visit, SI with hypertonic saline is applied for same-day diagnosis with microscopic examination and PCR and 2) for the next 2 days, morning self-expectorated specimens are collected for mycobacterial culture. A follow-up larger-scale randomized trial should be performed.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was partly supported by a research grant from Daewoong
