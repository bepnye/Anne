Fifteen patients who had previously undergone formal CPAP titration polysomnography were treated with either one night of the APAP with C-Flex or one night of conventional CPAP, in a crossover trial.

As such, we speculate that RSA C-Flex may improve compliance if used as chronic therapy. Furthermore, one of the major determinants of long-term compliance with CPAP is the early experience with the therapy. For many patients, in-laboratory titration represents the first exposure of any duration to CPAP therapy (Appendix 2). Any positive impact on this initial experience has the potential to improve compliance in the longer term. Use of RSA C-flex may thus be useful for initial titration of CPAP in the laboratory. For similar reasons, RSA C-flex may be useful in patients who are being titrated at home with APAP. The impact of RSA C-Flex on long-term compliance with chronic use, as “salvage” therapy of patients intolerant of standard CPAP, or its utility as part of a laboratory/ambulatory CPAP titration need to be studied in larger clinical trials.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24138" xml_f="25053" txt_i="17172" txt_f="18087">We acknowledge that there are a number of limitations to our study.

Second, we have studied a relatively small number of patients. Third, we have only studied patients for two nights in the laboratory and as such, we cannot extrapolate our study to chronic treatment. We have not tested CPAP adherence in this study; our results merely suggest a reasonable hypothesis for future study—that use of the RSA C-Flex may have a favorable effect on compliance. Finally, this study included patients with predominately severe disease who were compliant with CPAP.
