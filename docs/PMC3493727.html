However, intermittent bolus injection of propofol may be theoretically associated with fluctuation of plasma concentration. This variation of plasma level could lead to more frequent complications or delay of procedure due to unsteady sedation level. We hypothesized that continuous infusion of propofol may be associated with a more consistent level of plasma concentration so that maintaining a stable deep sedation level during ESD could be more easily and safely achieved. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety profile of deep sedation by continuous propofol infusion in patients underwent ESD, and also aimed to determine the additional advantage of propofol continuous infusion in combination with midazolam.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><offsets xml_i="9398" xml_f="9419" txt_i="3955" txt_f="3976">MATERIALS AND METHODS</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9439" xml_f="9467" txt_i="3977" txt_f="4005">1.

Moderate sedation with propofol, especially in bolus injection, may frequently move into lighter or deeper sedation due to inconstant plasma concentration of propofol, disturbing the ESD procedure. In our studies, an assessment of an accurate sedation level was performed using a MOAA/S scale every 5 minutes during ESD procedure. Similar to other studies for propofol sedation targeting a moderate sedation, our results showed that deep sedation with continuous propofol infusion during ESD had a relatively low incidence of cardiopulmonary complications.

Furthermore, sedation could be maintained with a significantly lower dose of propofol in the combination group. A significantly slower mean infusion rate in the combination group was also observed. Because propofol is a potent respiratory depressant, a significant reduction in the amount of propofol required for deep sedation could theoretically decrease the risk of respiratory depression. In our study, each of hypotension and hypoxemia showed no difference between two groups, but total adverse event rate of the combination group was significantly lower than propofol infusion alone group. Low doses and slow infusion rate of propofol may lead to a low incidence of adverse events. However, the combination protocol had a longer recovery time even though we only administered midazolam as a bolus at the start of the procedure to minimize the delay in recovery.

However, NAPS is still a subject of debate, and we cannot completely exclude the potential risk of cardiopulmonary complications of NAPS during ESD, even though we did not observe any major complications.

First, older and high-risk patients (ASA category IV) were excluded, and the proportion of ASA category III patients was small. This could be a cause of the relatively low incidence of cardiopulmonary complications. Second, we could not apply a double blind design; the endoscopist could not be blinded, which might have biased the satisfaction assessment. Third, the sample size was too small to exclude rare adverse events or to adequately power the study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of deep sedation by propofol. Finally, we did not directly compare the continuous propofol infusion and intermittent bolus injection of propofol, so further studies to compare the continuous infusion and intermittent bolus injection of propofol are needed to investigate the most effective and safe sedation protocol for ESD.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26514" xml_f="27151" txt_i="19605" txt_f="20242">The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of deep sedation induced by the continuous infusion of propofol administrated by a nonanesthesiologist during ESD. Using an adequate monitoring system, safe and efficient endoscopic procedures were performed with no serious adverse events using propofol. The combination protocol of continuous propofol infusion and intermittent intravenous midazolam injection can decrease the adverse events. However, further studies are needed on the specific adverse effects of propofol or other sedative agents used for deep sedation during complicated endoscopic
