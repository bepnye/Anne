Yet, there are many reported barriers to their use such as negative attitudes, reduced sexual pleasure, fit-and-feel problems and erection difficulties. The UK home-based intervention strategy (HIS-UK) is a behaviour change condom promotion intervention for use among young men (aged 16–25 years) designed to increase condom use by enhancing enjoyment of condom-protected intercourse. The objective of this feasibility study was to test HIS-UK for viability, operability and acceptability. Along with an assessment of the recruitment strategy and adherence to the intervention protocol, the study tested the reliability and suitability of a series of behavioural and condom use outcome measures to assess condom use attitudes, motivations, self-efficacy, use experience, errors and problems and fit and feel.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5671" xml_f="5678" txt_i="952" txt_f="959">Methods</offsets></title><p id="Par2"><offsets xml_i="5699" xml_f="6120" txt_i="960" txt_f="1381">The HIS-UK intervention and associated assessment instruments were tested for feasibility using a single-arm, repeated measures design with baseline measurement and two follow-up measurements over 3 months.

Despite initial reservations regarding workload and resource implications of being involved in the HIS-UK study, the health professionals were very positive about the intervention and engagement was good. In one recruitment centre, changes in condom distribution had already occurred as a result of being involved in HIS-UK.

For example, it was recommended that a visual tracking system was included on the questionnaires so participants could see how they were progressing on the survey tool. An option to provide further details to questions (open text boxes) was also desired, and a reduction in the number of (perceived repetitive) questionnaire items was requested. Furthermore, the young men felt that the intervention would benefit from the inclusion of strategies to reduce the impact of condom application (i.e. ‘breaking the mood’). Greater emphasis in the literature provided (participant information sheet, instruction guide, website etc.) on the need for, and advantages of, self-practice was another recommendation made. The health professionals felt that engagement of black and minority ethnic (BME) groups could be strengthened and that religious views regarding masturbation may prevent some young men from participating.

The feasibility study highlighted that our recruitment strategy was appropriate and we achieved our target sample size within the defined time-frame. However, a face-to-face recruitment approach in community and educational settings was deemed somewhat resource-intensive and consideration should be given to alternative recruitment options such as the utilisation of targeted social media advertisements and the use of peer-promoters. Moreover, young men from Black and minority ethnic communities were under-represented in the sample and future studies might employ more focused recruitment activities. In the consultation phase of the study, the potential impact of cultural taboos regarding masturbation and self-pleasure on participation was discussed, but we did not test any strategies to try to assess or reduce this as a potential barrier to recruitment.</offsets></p><p id="Par54"><offsets xml_i="48268" xml_f="48587" txt_i="36201" txt_f="36520">Participants were able to self-register for the study, and it was unfortunate that several men who expressed an interest in participating were unable to find an appropriate time to meet with the RA to receive their condom kit and/or did not show up to appointments.

Indeed, many participants reported that prior to participating in the study they had not given much thought to testing out different condoms for fit and feel, nor to self-practice of condoms in the absence of a sexual partner. That said, when rates of condom rating compliance were examined it was clear that all participant drop-out occurred soon after the condom kits were received—during the initial 2-week condom testing period. Feedback during the follow-up interviews highlighted the need to make all recruitment advertising more explicit regarding the role of solo-testing in the study to ensure that all potential participants are fully aware of what the study involves when they register.</offsets></p><p id="Par59"><offsets xml_i="51834" xml_f="52587" txt_i="39505" txt_f="40258">The HIS-UK intervention is novel in that it focuses on improving condom use experience, in particular the fit and feel of condoms during use. A recent review of the literature suggested that only a few previous interventions have had this focus (Anstee S, Graham CA, Stone N, Shepard J, Brown K, Newby K, Ingham R. The evidence for behavioural interventions addressing condom use fit and feel issues to improve condom use: A systematic review. Submitted). Our intervention is also brief and home-based and, thus, should be cost-effective and easy to implement in sexual health clinics as well as community settings. Indeed, NICE guidance recommends providing a range of condom types and distribution schemes to meet the differing needs of young people [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13"><offsets xml_i="52620" xml_f="52622" txt_i="40258" txt_f="40260">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="52629" xml_f="52631" txt_i="40260" txt_f="40262">].</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title><offsets xml_i="52664" xml_f="52674" txt_i="40264" txt_f="40274">Conclusion</offsets></title><p id="Par60"><offsets xml_i="52696" xml_f="53638" txt_i="40275" txt_f="41217">Based on our evaluation of the HIS-UK feasibility study, we conclude that the intervention is acceptable to young men and health promotion professionals and the research design, evaluative tools and outcome measures are appropriate. However, some further development and subsequent piloting of HIS-UK is required prior to testing the intervention in a large-scale randomised controlled trial. Acceptance to randomisation would need to be tested, and future studies might also evaluate the use of a video presentation of the study introduction and condom demonstration, as compared to face-to-face delivery (as in this study). This would provide consistency and standardisation in delivery and could reduce recruitment time and implementation costs, and help retain participants lost following registration. Outcome measurement in future trials should also include STI biomarkers to test the effectiveness of HIS-UK for reducing STI incidence.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p id="Par6">Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIS-UK</term><def><p id="Par7">Home-based intervention strategy UK</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KIHIS</term><def><p id="Par8">The Kinsey Institute Homework Intervention Strategy®</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICE</term><def><p id="Par9">National Institute of Health and Care Excellence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RA</term><def><p id="Par10">Research assistant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STI/STIs</term><def><p id="Par11">Sexually transmitted infection/s</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p id="Par12">United Kingdom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p id="Par13">United States</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Kinsey Institute Condom Use Research Team for their invaluable advice and for sharing with us the original intervention; the health promotion staff who offered their advice, support and guidance; the staff at the youth information and advice centres for their assistance with the advertising and recruitment of participants; the young men for their involvement in the study and Durbin and Pasante for their support and supply of free condom samples.
