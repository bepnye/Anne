Outcomes were only related to semester of enrollment and being a trainee versus a practitioner. Those who took the course in the spring had significantly greater improvements in knowledge and confidence scores than those enrolled in the fall. The differences between fall and spring may be because fall completers had substantially more time to forget learned information than their spring counterparts.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13112" xml_f="13507" txt_i="8586" txt_f="8981">Similarly, trainees had significantly greater improvements than practitioners in all three outcomes (knowledge, confidence, and communication). These differences may be due to two factors. First, trainees had lower baseline scores than practitioners, allowing for greater opportunity for improvement.

However, even six to ten months after completing the course, knowledge scores were significantly higher than the baseline scores. This suggests significant knowledge retention of the curriculum material. Confidence and communication scores progressively increased from baseline to the long-term follow-up. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that as individuals had more opportunity to practice the material they had learned, they could reinforce it and feel increasingly more confident and communicate with patients more comfortably.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14164" xml_f="14286" txt_i="9626" txt_f="9748">The results of this study are consistent with previous research that demonstrate the effectiveness of online CME courses [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="14317" xml_f="14318" txt_i="9748" txt_f="9749">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14325" xml_f="14326" txt_i="9749" txt_f="9750">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="14357" xml_f="14358" txt_i="9750" txt_f="9751">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14365" xml_f="14366" txt_i="9751" txt_f="9752">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="14397" xml_f="14398" txt_i="9752" txt_f="9753">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14405" xml_f="14632" txt_i="9753" txt_f="9980">].

First, the sample consisted of self selected enrollees who elected to learn more about HDS, which limits generalizability to elective courses; it is possible that outcomes would differ for participants in required courses. Another limitation is the low response rate to the long-term follow-up. This limits the generalizability of the outcomes to those individuals who have a greater willingness to complete surveys even after the completion of the initially planned study. Those who are willing to complete such voluntary questionnaires (which were not part of the original study "contract") may have been more knowledgeable and confident about their ability to do well. This conjecture is supported by the observation that those who completed the long-term follow-up had slightly, but significantly higher knowledge scores than the non-respondents. Also, the study relied on self-reported changes in confidence and communication, which may overestimate actual behavioral changes [14, 15, 16]; future studies in this field should corroborate self-report with objective measures of clinician behavior. Finally, we did not collect information on the actual costs of delivering the curriculum through each method because study personnel were engaged in both offering and studying the intervention and did not separately allocate research and education efforts. However, it is our impression that bolus-pull delivery is the least expensive to deliver for participants such as those in this study.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="16707" xml_f="16717" txt_i="11874" txt_f="11884">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16728" xml_f="17647" txt_i="11885" txt_f="12804">Despite these limitations, results from this long-term follow-up study have important implications for professional education and future research. Online case-based curriculum with evidence-based resource links results in significant and sustained improvements in knowledge, confidence, and communication. These improvements are substantial and do not appear to depend on the delivery strategy, at least among motivated clinicians. Therefore, educators can choose to offer on-line Continuing Education (CE) courses with confidence. Because the delivery strategy of online curriculum does not affect attainment of learning goals, the most convenient and low-cost delivery method can be utilized. Future studies about one-line CME should focus on whether required curriculum would have similar outcomes as elective courses as well as developing interventions that would further improve clinicians' communication patterns.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17669" xml_f="17688" txt_i="12806" txt_f="12825">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17699" xml_f="17759" txt_i="12826" txt_f="12886">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17781" xml_f="17803" txt_i="12888" txt_f="12910">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17814" xml_f="17840" txt_i="12911" txt_f="12937">TB drafted the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17847" xml_f="17923" txt_i="12938" txt_f="13014">KK conceived of the project, designed the survey and revised the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17930" xml_f="17997" txt_i="13015" txt_f="13082">PG reviewed and edited survey questions and revised the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18004" xml_f="18077" txt_i="13083" txt_f="13156">CW edited survey questions, analyzed the data and revised the manuscript.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18099" xml_f="18122" txt_i="13158" txt_f="13181">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18133" xml_f="18197" txt_i="13182" txt_f="13246">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6920/6/39/prepub"></ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Jessica Gobble, Michael Lischke, and the Northwest AHEC staff for their invaluable assistance; and Eleanor Russell and the Wake Forest University Physician Assistant Department for their support throughout this project.
