The pillow height that provides both the comparable laryngeal view and appropriate degree of head extension to open the mouth easily is recommended for tracheal intubation. In the present study, the thinner pillow (4 cm) is recommended versus the thicker pillow (8 cm) as the discomfort of an anesthesiologist during tracheal intubation was lower using the 4 cm pillow. If a certain degree of head elevation provided better laryngeal view only by extreme effort of anesthesiologist to extend the head and open the patient's mouth, it would not be recommendable.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18933" xml_f="19211" txt_i="13315" txt_f="13593">In seven human cadavers, the laryngeal view was measured using a direct laryngoscopy video system and the percentage of glottis opening (POGO) score with a straight laryngoscope blade by progressively increasing head elevation with neck flexion from the head lying as possible [</offsets><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="19243" xml_f="19245" txt_i="13593" txt_f="13595">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19252" xml_f="19775" txt_i="13595" txt_f="14118">]. The authors reported that as the head elevation and neck flexion increased, the POGO score improved. The study measured the laryngeal view according to the degree of head elevation but did not assess the anesthesiologist's discomfort score.

There is no standard for pillow height. The two heights of pillows were selected as they are used commonly in our hospital and are commercially available. Secondly, there are no approved definitions concerning the laryngeal, pharyngeal and oral axes, and it is unpractical to use MRI on every patient to determine axes more objectively. In the present study, the axes were defined according to the authors' decision. Thirdly, the results of the present study are difficult to apply to patients who have difficult airways as the Mallampatti class of the patients in this study were 1-2. Lastly, obesity is one of the causes of difficult airway. Body mass index was not measured.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21078" xml_f="21294" txt_i="15319" txt_f="15535">In conclusion, with the higher degree of head elevation, the laryngeal view and
