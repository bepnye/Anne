The study questionnaire included personal details and job satisfaction scale by Smith and Kendall. Sampling was done randomly and nurses were divided into test and control groups. In the test group, the communication skills training program was done in 6 sessions, twice a week and each session was held for 2 hours.

The first part consisted of demographic characteristics with 12 questions: workplace, sex, age, education, marital status, employment status, number of child, occupation of spouse, housing status, experience, financial status and working shift. The second part consisted of questions related to job satisfaction which were extracted from the Smith and Kendall scale (JDI: Job Descriptive Index). This scale was designed in Cornell University by Smith, Kendall and Hulin in 1969 and was translated by Shekarshekan (2004). Through correlating this scale with the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), for the factors of overall job satisfaction, job, supervisor, salary, promotions and coworker, Khsoravi obtained Cronbach’s alpha of 42.63, 0.25, 0.48, 0.37, 0.0 and 0.31 respectively and confirmed its validity. Moreover, for its reliability, he obtained Cronbach’s alpha of 0.67 for job, 0.92 for supervisor, 0.86 for coworker, 0.90 for promotions, 0.93 for salary and 0.92 for overall job satisfaction, and confirmed it as a reliable tool.
