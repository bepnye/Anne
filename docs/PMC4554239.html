NiTi rotary mechanical preflaring was firstly introduced with the PathFile system by Dentsply Maillefer. The PathFile (PF; Dentsply Maillefer) NiTi pathfinding rotary system is manufactured from a conventional austenite NiTi alloy for canal preflaring.

The crown and distal root of each tooth were removed at the level of the cemento-enamel to obtain root canal measuring 12 mm in length for specimen standardization. Apical patency was confirmed with a number # 08 stainless steel manual K-type file. To avoid any bias caused by differences in the initial width, all the canals that, before any instrumentation, could be easily negotiated up to the apex with a #15 (or wider) file were not included in the study.

To ensure consistent radiographs for all specimens, an L-shaped wooden platform was manufactured to position the head of the x-ray tube perpendicular to the digital sensor at a focal distance of 30 cm. The acrylic jig containing the root was then positioned at the center of the sensor so as to align perfectly with a square-shaped guide previously designed on the sensor, thus allowing the jig to be accurately repositioned during the experimental procedure. After sealing the apical foramen using a small piece of wax, roots were embedded in 2 x 2 x 2 mm acrylic resin blocks so that they could be removed for preparation and later reinserted in a predetermined position for the purpose of comparing the images taken before and after preparation using standardized radiographic imaging.
