Surveying safety aspects of the tested AED, we found that 92.4% of students were able to deliver a shock safely in semiautomatic mode and 95.8% in automatic mode during testing without prior instruction.

With the Philips/Laerdal Heartstart1 the result was only 4.2%, and the Zoll AEDPlus had the worst result, with 41.6% incorrect pad positioning. In some cases, confusing descriptions or drawings might have caused the incorrect positioning of the adhesive pad electrodes in the present study. Overall, this supports the conclusion of Eames and coworkers that simple devices should be developed with clear visual instructions, and it reiterates that design, construction and visual aids have an impact on user performance. This statement was confirmed by our observation that even in the second evaluation, in the automatic group three students were unable to deliver a shock. In these three cases the students were confused by the voice prompts of the automatic device, and while trying to push the shock button they turned the device off. Other detected problems in both testing sessions occurred mainly as a result of language problems, but they were reduced after instruction. In general, none of the participants appeared to be apprehensive about operating the AED because none of them refused to participate in the study or to apply the device to the manikin.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20311" xml_f="20819" txt_i="14594" txt_f="15102">The significant difference in time to shock before and after instruction between semiautomatic AED and the automatic device is a possible effect of the software version used. However, the programmed delay of 3 s to delivery of shock in the automatic device does not adequately explain this finding. Changing the timing of voice prompts and development of clearer instructions may lead to different results.

The more time required to achieve the necessary skills, the less people will feel able to participate voluntarily.

The observation that measures of practical performance (i.e. time to first shock, accuracy of electrode pad placement and safety) were significantly improved after minimal theoretical instruction and one use, but without technical instructions in the use of the specific device, is supportive of widespread implementation of PAD programmes wherever possible. Moreover, enhanced acceptance of AEDs and the increased likelihood that AEDs will be used following directed 'public information' (e.g. television campaigns or other extensive publicly available media) is of great importance. Core issues (e.g. the significance of sudden cardiac death and the importance of defibrillation in this context) should be at the forefront of new educational changes; some suggestions in this regard were made in the present study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25343" xml_f="25943" txt_i="19074" txt_f="19674">Taken together, our findings support previous recommendations to develop features that can be made available in all AEDs. Sophisticated devices with simple instructions – visual or vocal – should be implemented in PAD programmes. Further developments should aim at simplifying the application of electrodes and achieving consistency in the instructions given by the different manufacturers. Value must be attached to giving general instructions and information about features that are common to all devices; describing the specific details of a device does not appear to be essential, as was assumed.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25950" xml_f="26868" txt_i="19675" txt_f="20593">In our opinion, one of the most remarkable findings is that all tested laypersons were able to deliver a shock in less than 1 min after minimal instructions had been given, regardless of whether automatic or semiautomatic mode was used. Despite the limitations of the study, we conclude that only minimal background knowledge is needed for laypersons to use an AED safely and quickly, and that further implementation of AEDs for use by minimally trained persons without any medical training is possible. We believe that keeping instructions for laypersons as simple as possible will lead to greater acceptance and motivation, and will further facilitate PAD programmes. Time spent training to acquire necessary cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills within the BLS algorithm can be saved by focusing AED instructions in this way. Further studies are warranted to determine whether skills are retained over the long term.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26890" xml_f="26902" txt_i="20595" txt_f="20607">Key messages</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26913" xml_f="27052" txt_i="20608" txt_f="20747">• 	This first observation in 'fully' automatic devices confirms that this type of AED can be used safely and effectively by lay responders.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27059" xml_f="27223" txt_i="20748" txt_f="20912">• 	All tested laypersons were able to deliver a shock in less than 1 min after minimal instructions, regardless of whether automatic or semiautomatic mode was used.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27230" xml_f="27373" txt_i="20913" txt_f="21056">• 	In future value must be attached to general instruction and similarities; describing specific details of available devices is not essential.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27380" xml_f="27497" txt_i="21057" txt_f="21174">• 	Previous recommendations to develop features that can be made available in all AEDs are supported by our findings.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="27519" xml_f="27532" txt_i="21176" txt_f="21189">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27543" xml_f="27644" txt_i="21190" txt_f="21291">AED = automated external defibrillator; BLS = basic life support; PAD = public access defibrillation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="27666" xml_f="27685" txt_i="21293" txt_f="21312">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27696" xml_f="27756" txt_i="21313" txt_f="21373">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="27778" xml_f="27800" txt_i="21375" txt_f="21397">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27811" xml_f="28104" txt_i="21398" txt_f="21691">SB had conceived the study.
