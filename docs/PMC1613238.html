In contrast, there has been a recent expansion of supervised injectable diamorphine programs under trial conditions in a number of European and North American cities, although the evidence regarding the safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness of this treatment approach remains equivocal.

Whilst exact numbers are unavailable, we estimate that in 2006, there are between 2,000 to 3,000 patients prescribed injectable methadone ampoules, and up to 500 patients prescribed diamorphine in the NHS for opioid dependence. This total number in IOT has remained relatively static over the past decade, with little 'turn-over' and few new patients commencing IOT. Yet during this same period there has been a marked expansion of numbers in opioid substitution (largely oral methadone and buprenorphine) treatment in Britain, from fewer than 50,000 to over 100,000, reflecting both a probable increase in the number of heroin users and the proportion in treatment. Thus, whilst the number of heroin dependent users and the number of patients entering substitution treatment in Britain appears to be steadily increasing over the past decade, the role of IOT has proportionally diminished, with few new patients commencing this form of treatment.

However, there were two key limitations with the study. No data were reported for what are generally considered to be primary outcomes of treatment for heroin dependence – levels of illicit heroin use and ongoing high-risk injecting practices. We will return to this issue later. More importantly however, the study did not examine whether the addition of injectable heroin conferred benefits over 'enhanced' or 'optimal' methadone treatment. There were no specific attempts to optimise the conditions of methadone treatment for those patients randomised to the methadone only group. Hence, it may be that some patients were performing poorly at enrolment due to an inadequate methadone dose, poor psychosocial services or infrequent attendance. Without specific measures to optimize their treatment, it may not be surprising that many continued to have poor outcomes. Indeed the different outcomes between the two randomized groups could be due to the considerable differences in opioid doses used, and not due to the type or route of opioid used (the mean methadone dose in the Oral Methadone group was approximately 70 mg, whereas the mean methadone equivalent dose in the Injectable Diamorphine group was greater than 200 mg daily).

The detection of morphine in urine drug screens (UDS) may be a suitable marker for heroin use in methadone patients, but is useless as a marker in diamorphine prescribed patients. Further, the possible perception by some clients that unfavourable outcomes for a trial-based diamorphine program could result in its discontinuation or scaling back, could serve as a motive for clients to under-report their illicit heroin use, particularly in the absence of UDS. Under such circumstances, the validity and reliability of self-reported illicit heroin use may be questioned. In response, there have been efforts to establish objective measures of illicit heroin use that do not rely on the detection of morphine.

For the Injectable Methadone group, initial doses are converted from oral to injectable methadone.

Hence, the study uses a conversion formula of injected methadone dose = 0.8 × oral methadone dose (separate research underway at the National Addiction Centre is examining the biavailaibility of injectable methadone (IM and IV) in long term oral methadone patients). Doses are subsequently titrated (generally upwards) and individualised with the aim of reducing illicit opiate use. Patients can also choose to have oral methadone supplements.

The dose equivalence between oral methadone and diamorphine is not linear. At low doses, the conversion rate from oral methadone (total daily dose) to injected heroin (total daily dose) is approximately 1:3; whilst at higher doses, the conversion rate approximates 1:5. Other factors that impact upon methadone metabolism (e.g. concomitant medications, medical conditions) are taken into consideration at transfer. Doses are subsequently titrated and individualised with the aim of reducing illicit opiate use. Patients are encouraged to retain a small oral methadone dose (e.g. 20 to 40% of their initial dose) in order to prevent opiate withdrawal between injecting sessions, and to facilitate any transitions between oral methadone and injected diamorphine (effectively having a 'loading dose' of methadone). It is expected that most patients will use injected diamorphine doses in the range of 300 to 600 mg per day, with an upper total daily dose of 900 mg (450 mg per injection). Patients can also have up to 100 mg oral methadone supplementary to diamorphine, making their total oral methadone equivalent dose approximately 300 mg.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42206" xml_f="42208" txt_i="34760" txt_f="34762">- </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="42216" xml_f="42233" txt_i="34762" txt_f="34779">Supervised dosing</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="42242" xml_f="43018" txt_i="34779" txt_f="35555">. All doses of prescribed injectable opioids are supervised throughout the 6-month study period. Treatment typically involves once-a-day injection of methadone, or twice-a-day injection of diamorphine. Patients have a degree of autonomy in the frequency of attendance for dosing and the mix of injected opioids/oral methadone – patients unable or unwilling to attend for injectable opioid treatment have access to oral methadone doses. This flexibility of attendance for on-site injecting aims to minimize the inconvenience of IOT, and reflects that many patients entering RIOTT may not be injecting every day, and hence, it may not be therapeutically necessary for patients to increase their frequency of injecting.

Underlying this is the question 'how much evidence is required in order to scientifically establish the efficacy and safety of a particular treatment'? The experience of substitution opiate treatment (methadone, LAAM, buprenorphine) suggests that considerable and unequivocal evidence is required in order to defend such treatments against politicised critics – be they politicians, academics, service providers, local community or (ex)drug user groups – much more so than in most other areas of medicine. This applies to an even greater extent with the highly controversial issue of injectable opioid prescribing. A particularly strong evidence base will be a minimum requirement in establishing IOT as an available option – the findings of two or three RCTs alone are unlikely to convince sceptics of such a contentious treatment paradigm. The most recent systematic Cochrane review of heroin prescribing suggests that differences in study design limit our capacity to draw conclusions on the available published trials in this area. The completion and dissemination of the various international trials in Germany, Spain, Canada and Britain is required in order to establish this evidence base, particularly as we should not pre-empt the findings of such studies in assuming that they will all show similar results. Should the broad safety and efficacy of IOT be established through the various trials underway internationally, it will enable researchers to address the next 'level' of clinical-research questions. This may include issues around the availability of take-away doses of injectables, the selection of which opioids should be prioritised, and whether patients can be successfully transitioned from injecting to non-injecting (e.g. intranasal, oral) routes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="61195" xml_f="61856" txt_i="51418" txt_f="52079">We should also recognise that, as with the expansion of methadone and buprenorphine treatment internationally over the past 20 years, any expansion of IOT will often be preceded by calls for 'local' research that addresses local concerns and regulatory requirements. Interestingly, whilst Phase III RCTs are often conducted in order to achieve registration of a new medicine, in the British context however, licensing of IOT is not the issue. Rather research is required to establish its role within the treatment system after over a decade of decline, and at a time where health systems are requiring a greater evidence base of efficacy and cost-effectiveness.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="61878" xml_f="61897" txt_i="52081" txt_f="52100">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="61908" xml_f="61968" txt_i="52101" txt_f="52161">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="61990" xml_f="62012" txt_i="52163" txt_f="52185">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="62023" xml_f="62400" txt_i="52186" txt_f="52563">NL and JS are the Chief Investigators, and NM is the Trial Co-ordinator and Co-investigator.
