Our aim was to assess the effect of modified slow breathing exercise on stress, regardless of the cause of stress. The biochemical parameters for assessing stress levels such as serum cortisol, vanillylmandelic acid, metanephrine, interleukin-6, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances could have provided a more objective measure of stress, which we could not incorporate in the present study. Hence, future studies can be conducted ensuring double-blinded conditions with the inclusion of biochemical parameters for a more accurate evaluation of stress. Furthermore, the study period of breathing practice could be extended more than 12 weeks to see if any clinically significant results could be obtained with respect to blood pressure and BMI.
