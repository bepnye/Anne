A 70 nt duplex DNA was designed with 20 nt fixed flanking sequences at the 3′ and 5′ ends and a randomized 30 nt internal sequence. The fixed sequence at the 5′ end contained a BbsI site six bases removed from the randomized region. BbsI cuts downstream of its recognition site generating four base 5′ overhangs with recessed 3′ termini. Cleavage produced a 50 nt template and 46 nt primer with the 3′ terminus within the randomized region. HIV-RT was incubated with this substrate and material that bound RT was isolated by gel-shift. The recovered material was treated to regenerate the BbsI site, amplified by PCR, cleaved with BbsI and selected with HIV-RT again. This was repeated for 12 rounds. Material from round 12 bound approximately 10-fold more tightly than starting material. All selected round 12 primer-templates had similar sequence configuration with a 6–8 base G run at the 3′ primer terminus, similar to the HIV polypurine tract. Further modifications indicate that the Gs were necessary and sufficient for strong binding.</offsets></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4366" xml_f="4378" txt_i="1245" txt_f="1257">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4389" xml_f="4504" txt_i="1258" txt_f="1373">Using an approach developed in the 1990s called SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1"><offsets xml_i="4535" xml_f="4536" txt_i="1373" txt_f="1374">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4543" xml_f="4544" txt_i="1374" txt_f="1375">–</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3"><offsets xml_i="4575" xml_f="4576" txt_i="1375" txt_f="1376">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4583" xml_f="4725" txt_i="1376" txt_f="1518">), single-stranded nucleic acids that bind to human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) with high affinity were identified (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4"><offsets xml_i="4756" xml_f="4757" txt_i="1518" txt_f="1519">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4764" xml_f="4765" txt_i="1519" txt_f="1520">–</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6"><offsets xml_i="4796" xml_f="4797" txt_i="1520" txt_f="1521">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4804" xml_f="5474" txt_i="1521" txt_f="2191">). The SELEX method is based on differential binding of nucleic acids to a substrate protein. Initially a large random pool of RNAs is incubated with a limiting amount of protein. Nucleic acids that bind with higher affinity will preferentially associate with the protein and can be isolated by gel-shift or nitrocellulose filter binding. The selected pool is expanded using PCR then RNA transcription and the new pool is subjected to another round of protein binding. After several rounds nucleic acids with high affinity for the protein, also referred to as aptamers, can be isolated. In the case of HIV-RT, these RNA aptamers were usually pseudoknot-type structures (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7"><offsets xml_i="5505" xml_f="5506" txt_i="2191" txt_f="2192">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5513" xml_f="5650" txt_i="2192" txt_f="2329">).

For both RNA and DNA, the main factor underlying tight binding to RT was the folded structure rather than the sequence of the nucleic acids. This method has since been used to isolate aptamers that can bind several different proteins, including several therapeutic targets [reviewed in (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11"><offsets xml_i="6173" xml_f="6175" txt_i="2705" txt_f="2707">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6182" xml_f="6183" txt_i="2707" txt_f="2708">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12"><offsets xml_i="6215" xml_f="6217" txt_i="2708" txt_f="2710">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6224" xml_f="6318" txt_i="2710" txt_f="2804">)].

It is well established that RT binds DNA primers on an RNA template more tightly than on DNA templates; however, it is not known whether strong sequence preferences exist. Tight binding sequences could potentially be used to help design aptamers and aid in understanding how RT recognizes and binds to substrates. To determine whether tight binding DNA–DNA primer-template sequences could be isolated, we used a novel SELEX-based approach. Primer-template sequence that bound 10-fold tighter than random sequences were selected. All the recovered sequences had the same basic sequence motif characterized by a run of several G residues at the primer 3′ terminus. In such, they mimicked the sequence of the polypurine tract (ppt) RNA primer used by HIV to initiate plus strand DNA synthesis.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><offsets xml_i="7316" xml_f="7337" txt_i="3747" txt_f="3768">MATERIALS AND METHODS</offsets></title><sec sec-type="materials"><title><offsets xml_i="7378" xml_f="7387" txt_i="3769" txt_f="3778">Materials</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7398" xml_f="7736" txt_i="3779" txt_f="4117">Wild-type HIV-RT was from Worthington Biochemical Corporation.

The measured value for 12-1 was at least an order of magnitude lower than the values for 1-1 and 1-2. To determine why, several chimeric substrates were tested that included sequences derived from both 12-1 and 1-1 as well as other changes. In the ‘2 Gs’ substrate the run of 7 G's in 12-1 was reduced to two at the 3′ terminus with the other nucleotides of the run replaced by mostly 1-1 nt. This substrate bound comparably with 1-1 indicating that a run of Gs greater than two is required for tight binding. Substrates ‘12 Gs’ and ‘26 Gs’ increased the length of the G run in 12-1 to 12 and 26 nt, respectively. The latter represents a complete G-C primer-template sequence in the random region of the substrate. Both substrates bound at least as tightly as 12-1, with 26 Gs showing slightly tighter binding. These results indicate that the longer runs of Gs do not prevent tight binding and there may even be slightly tighter binding with very long runs. Two additional substrates were tested. In one (7 Gs template) the 7 Gs in the primer strand were switched into the template and the C's in the template switched to the primer. This substrate lost the ability to bind tightly indicating that the G residues must be in the primer strand for tight binding. Finally, a substrate that retained the 7 Gs from 12-1 but had all other nucleotides in the random region replaced by 1-1 nt was tested (7 Gs only).

Indeed, although our discussion has focused on the G run in the primer strand, the complementary deoxycytosine run in the template could be as important with respect to the substrate conforming for tight binding.

The diagram illustrates the basic approach used to isolate primer-template sequences that bound HIV-RT with high affinity. The double-stranded DNA starting material contained a 30 nt random region flanked by two 20 nt fixed sequences. The BbsI cleavage site in the 5′ fixed sequences was used to generate substrates with recessed 3′ termini in the random region. These substrates (500 pm in the first round) were incubated with a limiting amount of HIV-RT and bound material was isolated by gel-shift. The recovered material was processed to essentially regenerate the starting material configuration. PCR was then used to amplify the selected material which was cleaved with BbsI and recovered by gel electrophoresis. This recovered material was then subjected to another round of selection for a total of 12 rounds. *, In rounds subsequent to the first enough RT to bind ∼1/20th of the total recovered material was added. See Methods for details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkj426f1"></graphic></fig><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Sequence of the material recovered from rounds 10 and 12. Sequences of the round 10 and 12 material in the 30 nt random region of the primer strand are shown. All sequences are aligned at the 3′ end and the first six bases of the primer strand that would be present after cleavage with BbsI are underlined. Many recovered sequences were truncated by 1 nt and lost bases (∼) are denoted at the 5′ end. Two sequences had a 1 nt addition (shown in bold at the 5′ end) resulting in a 31 base random region. ‘N’ denotes a nucleotide that was not clearly identified during sequencing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkj426f2"></graphic></fig><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(A–C). Substrates measured for binding affinity to HIV-RT. (<bold>A</bold>) Shown are diagrams of 8 different substrates tested for affinity to HIV-RT. The 20 base pair fixed region is denoted by dashes (- - - - -) and was identical for all substrates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Sequences corresponding to the random region from the first clone shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (round 12 #1) are shown in bold in substrate 12-1 (bold letters). Substrates 1-1 (underlined nt) and 1-2 were randomly recovered from the starting material to serve as controls. Other substrates were as shown. When bases derived from 12-1 or 1-1 were used to construct chimeric substrates they are denoted in bold or underlined letters, respectively. The name and <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value for binding to HIV-RT (in parentheses) is shown to the right of each substrate. Values are from an average of at least three experiments ± SD. (<bold>B</bold>) An autoradiogram from a typical experiment using substrates 1-1 and 12-1 is shown. The substrate (1 nM) was 5′ P-32 end-labeled on the primer strand and mixed with various amounts of HIV-RT as described in Methods. Reactions were initiated by the addition of dNTPs and heparin ‘trap’ to sequester RT molecules not bound to the substrate and those that dissociate. This limits extension to a single binding event between the substrate and enzyme. The concentrations of RT used were from left to right: 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 nM. Extended and non-extended primer positions are indicated. The amount of bound enzyme at the various concentrations of RT was determined from the level of extended products using a phosphoimager. Lane A, no enzyme added; lane B, full extension of substrate in the absence of trap with 40 nM RT; lane C, RT (40 nM) was added to a reaction containing trap, dNTPs and substrate and incubated for 3 min (trap control).

A plot of [Bound substrate] versus [HIV-RT] for an experiment with 1-1 and 12-1 is shown. The concentrations of RT used in the assays depended on RT's affinity for the particular substrate and were chosen to span the range of the approximate <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value. For 12-1 RT concentrations were 1.3, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 nM and for 1-1, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 nM were used. The plotted values were fitted to an equation for determining the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value (see Methods).

Off-rate determination for substrates 12-1 and 1-1. (<bold>A</bold>) Substrates 1-1 or 12-1 were preincubated with 100 or 15 nM HIV-RT, respectively. A mixture containing heparin trap was added to the reactions and aliquots were removed at 10 s, 20 s, 40 s, 1 min, 2 min, 4 min, 8 min, 12 min and 16 min, mixed with a solution containing dNTPs and incubated for 3 min. Extended products represent the amount of RT remaining bound to the substrate at the various time points. For time 0 (reactions after lane D for each substrate), a mixture containing dNTPs and heparin trap was mixed with the RT-substrate preincubation solution. Lane A, no enzyme; lanes B–D, RT (100 or 15 nM for 1-1 or 12-1, respectively) was added to a reactions containing heparin trap, dNTPs, and substrate and incubated for 1 (A), 8 (B) or 16 (C) min (trap controls).
