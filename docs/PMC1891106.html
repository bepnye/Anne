No statistically significant differences could be demonstrated between groups by quantitative evaluation. Nevertheless, in the samples from groups C and D, both treated with naloxone, there was evidence of more new bone and less fibrous tissue and parent bone than in the other groups. The lack of significance could be related to the low numbers of animals per group, the high individual variability and/or the relatively long time period between cessation of treatment and sacrifice.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32056" xml_f="32356" txt_i="25231" txt_f="25531">A number of limitations must be noted in this study.

Further studies are needed to establish the effects of frequency and overall length of the treatment. A segmental osteotomy model could also permit the effects of naloxone alone and in association with calcium gluconate to be evaluated in a mechanically unstable environment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33371" xml_f="33390" txt_i="26490" txt_f="26509">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33401" xml_f="33461" txt_i="26510" txt_f="26570">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33483" xml_f="33505" txt_i="26572" txt_f="26594">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33516" xml_f="34296" txt_i="26595" txt_f="27375">LP conceived, supervised and coordinated the study and its design, and drafted the manuscript.
