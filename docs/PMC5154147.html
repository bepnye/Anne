These Wards were selected because they are urban/peri-urban and comprise Lusaka, the main city of Zambia. In order to select households, all 40 wards were subdivided into enumeration areas (EAs) based on household density. The centroid point of each EA was generated using ArcGIS version 10.2 software (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA). Centroid points that are within 150 m of the ward boundary were excluded, to avoid enumerators approaching houses that are not in the selected ward. Five EA centroid points and five back-up points will be randomly selected per ward. Enumerator supervisors visited each GPS point and directed enumerators into a Random Walk from each selected EA centroid point, visiting every other house in each direction.

When the enumerator visits a selected household, he/she records a roster of individuals living in that house. The roster assigns each individual a number, then one individual is randomly selected for participation. If that participant is not eligible, the next randomly selected individual from the roster will be approached. If no one is eligible, then the house will be labeled “no one eligible.” If the participant is home but busy, the interviewer will schedule an appointment for a later time. If no one is home, the interviewer will approach one additional time. If no one is home at the second visit, then a GPS coordinate is recorded and the household labeled “no one available.” If the individual at the household refuses to participate, then the household will be labeled “refused.”</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29620" xml_f="30306" txt_i="20590" txt_f="21276">A structured questionnaire was administered to each eligible and consented individual who met the inclusion criteria.

Ward level population density based on the 2010 census data, ward level poverty, and average distance to the nearest health facility were used to stratify the randomization. Additional balance checks were conducted to ensure randomization was successful. Each ward has been mapped including the IPC sites, and all visited houses enumerated and given an ID. Since randomization, the IPC intervention has been implemented in intervention wards only. Only the IPA statistician and the implementing partner (the SFH) know the allocation of wards. The endline survey is planned for March 2017, and will follow the same protocol as outlined above for the baseline survey. The endline survey will have additional questions regarding exposure to the mass media and IPC intervention, including pictures to prompt recall.

After the baseline survey was conducted, the intervention was rolled out: the WC is now be available throughout Lusaka coupled with the mass media campaign. The IPC intervention is being implemented in the randomly selected intervention wards. Since completion of baseline, IPA and SFH have been carrying out a process evaluation to assess the fidelity of the various components of the WC project as well as penetration of the IPC intervention. This is being done to assess the following: (1) availability and distribution of the WC, (2) tracking of the mass media campaign, (3) penetration and reach of the IPC intervention, and (4) acceptability of the WC.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34486" xml_f="35094" txt_i="24460" txt_f="25068">First, to monitor the availability and distribution of the WC, we will review monitoring data from SFH to track the availability of the WC throughout Lusaka. SFH is keeping track of distributions of the WC to determine how many WC products are purchased throughout the year. To assess availability to potential customers, we are implementing mystery shopper techniques to visit pharmacies and other distribution venues in all wards to determine if the WC is available and in stock. This can be cross-compared with records kept by the SFH of how many WCs have been purchased and distributed throughout Lusaka.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35101" xml_f="35405" txt_i="25069" txt_f="25373">Second, we are working with SFH to ensure that all components of the mass media intervention are consistently rolled out, for example, checking that the website is up to date and the pages are successfully loading.

We are conducting “spot checks” and attending a random selection of IPC activities to determine if the IPC is being implemented and if the IPC agent is adhering to the training curriculum and key components of the intervention. We are also comparing logs with IPC agents regarding how many individuals attend the IPC. IPC agents are collecting ”client forms” during IPC sessions to provide information on the number of participants, date, location, and gender composition of the sessions. We have developed and implemented monitoring tools to collect information at the IPC sessions on participation, quality of delivery, and frequency of IPC sessions in each ward to measure the intervention intensity and penetration. The evaluation team is also monitoring the process of setting up IPC appointments and tracking (on random visits) how many invitations for IPC are sent out to measure take-up of the intervention. This is running parallel to the administrative/monitoring data that SFH is collecting.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36500" xml_f="36980" txt_i="26456" txt_f="26936">Lastly, 30 qualitative focus group discussions are being conducted to understand how the WC product is being received in the communities. SFH may also collect short user surveys or collect qualitative data that can be shared. This will help determine if the product is available and if the mass media is being seen/accessed. It will also help us understand any reactions to the WC, how the messaging is being interpreted, and the acceptability of the new product to the community.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36987" xml_f="37750" txt_i="26937" txt_f="27700">The evaluation team will work closely with the SFH team to ensure all administrative data needed for analysis are collected during the intervention. We will also note if any other major SRH activities are occurring throughout the study period, for example, any other products added to the market, any major stockouts of existing products, or any widespread education campaigns that might impact the IPC intervention. Overall this process evaluation will determine key factors that may impact the outcomes of the IPC intervention (i.e., availability of the WC, the consistency of the media campaign, and the quality of and reach of the IPC intervention). The process evaluation began when the project was rolled out, and is ongoing until the endline survey begins.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title><offsets xml_i="37783" xml_f="37816" txt_i="27702" txt_f="27735">Data management and analysis plan</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37827" xml_f="38513" txt_i="27736" txt_f="28422">The data are collected into an Android phone using SurveyCTO software; the data obtained are cleaned and exported into Stata for analysis.
