The primary objective of the study was to 1) increase the amount of habitual physical activity, 2) reduce the amount of total screen time, and 3) increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables among children enrolled in the intervention. By targeting both physical activity (and inactivity – e.g., screen time) and diet it was hoped that we could create a larger impact on energy balance than could be achieved through efforts to target either component on its own. A secondary objective was to reduce the occurrence of overweight/excessive weight gain during the study period. In addition, the study aimed to increase community awareness about the obesity epidemic and the desired behavior changes. The primary outcome measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention included pedometer-assessed physical activity, self-reported screen time, and self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption. A number of other measures were obtained to answer questions about effects of media violence exposure, changes in parental monitoring of children's media habits, children's aggressive and pro-social behaviors, and school performance.

To receive points children and families engaged in SWITCH activities: making healthy fruit and vegetable recipes, using the activity jar to increase physical activity, and utilizing the screen time box to keep track of time spent in front of screens (television, video games, computer.) The child recorded his or her physical activity (Do), screen time (View), and fruit and vegetable consumption (Chew) on a daily basis.

Supplemental worksheet activities also gave teachers tools to reinforce these concepts during the week.

The individual child is surrounded most immediately by various microsystem environments. These are the immediate environments with which a child interacts, his or her parents, siblings, teachers, peers, etc. The mesosystem is the relationships that exist between the various microsystems, such as the relations that parents have with a child's siblings and teachers that can affect the target child. The exosystem includes environments with which the child doesn't usually directly interact, but that can still affect the child. These include decisions made by school boards, the opportunities present at the parents' workplaces, etc. The macrosystem includes the broad societal settings under which the others function. These include shared culture, history, or customs, the system of laws, and the economic system. The mass media are often placed at the exosystem level, although a case could be made that the mass media belong at every level. For example, when the child is watching TV, it is part of the microsystem. The siblings and parents also watch and are influenced by TV, and these influences can affect the target child (mesosystem). The media production happens at a level not usually accessible by the child, but those decisions can still affect the child (exosystem).

These two community school districts comprising ten elementary schools (6 in Cedar Rapids and 4 in Lakeville) were chosen to participate in the study. Schools were matched within district based on average school enrollment and percent free/reduced-cost lunch, and randomly assigned to either an experimental (3 in Cedar Rapids and 2 in Lakeville) or control (3 in Cedar Rapids and 2 in Lakeville) condition. A total of 1359 children were enrolled in the study out of 2091 possible, a 65% participation rate. Participation rates were similar between experimental and control schools, with 685 out of 1019 children participating in experimental schools (67% participation) and 674 out of 1072 children participating in control schools (63% participation).

The family component is essential in the development of an environment that supports children's efforts to implement changes in their food choices and levels of physical activity and screen time. To accomplish these goals, the family component consisted of monthly packets which included new materials each month for both the child and the parents. Among the materials included were: a printed brochure describing the project and highlighting the timeline; a printed calendar for the month to help motivate and remind parents about their progress on screen time, activity and nutrition goals designed to easily track each goal; a packet of screen time tickets for the child/parent to track screen time; an activity jar with tips for increasing physical activity; a screen time box with tickets to track the amount of screen time; a meal planner which the families could plan meals and make a grocery list; and recipes that primarily focused on increasing fruits and vegetables in creative and enticing ways that interested children were also provided.

Parents were also asked about their children's current media practices, exercise habits, and weight, and about their current behavior regarding their children's media use and exercising. These random surveys were conducted immediately before the SWITCH program implementation, in September 2005, and immediately at the end of the program implementation in June, 2006 (with a new randomly selected sample of 800 parents). The community surveys were conducted by the independent research firm, Anderson, Niebuhr &amp; Associates, Inc.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44845" xml_f="44852" txt_i="34622" txt_f="34629">Summary</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44863" xml_f="45507" txt_i="34630" txt_f="35274">In summary, we have described the background and rationale; study design, measurement procedures, intervention components, and process evaluation procedures. We hope this report will be useful to researchers, public health professionals, and school administrators and health professionals (nurses and physical/health educators) seeking to develop similar prevention programs. It is obvious that more collaborative, inter-disciplinary, multi-level work is needed before a proven, effective intervention package to modify behaviors related to childhood obesity can be generally recommended. It is our hope that SWITCH is a step in that direction.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="45535" xml_f="45554" txt_i="35277" txt_f="35296">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="45565" xml_f="45623" txt_i="35297" txt_f="35355">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="45645" xml_f="45667" txt_i="35357" txt_f="35379">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="45678" xml_f="45995" txt_i="35380" txt_f="35697">JCE, DAG, RC, SS, MW, and DW designed the study, established methods and questionnaires, participated in coordination of the study.
