and financial and time limitations to perform group training programs and also the specifications of CD training such as learning based on learner's interest and needs, cost-effectiveness, self-learning, efficiency, accessibility, possibility of training for several times, flexibility, being learner-oriented, training without any time limitations and tirelessness, wide range of
