One such issue is the correct use of asthma inhaler devices. Up to 80% of people with asthma use their inhaler device incorrectly. The implications of this are poor asthma control and quality of life. Correct inhaler technique can be taught, however these educational instructions need to be repeated if correct technique is to be maintained. It is important to maximise the opportunities to deliver this education in primary care. In light of this, it is important to explore how health care providers, in particular pharmacists and general medical practitioners, can work together in delivering inhaler technique education to patients, over time. Therefore, there is a need to develop and evaluate effective inter-professional education, which will address the need to educate patients in the correct use of their inhalers as well as equip health care professionals with skills to engage in collaborative relationships with each other.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6312" xml_f="6319" txt_i="1059" txt_f="1066">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6330" xml_f="6512" txt_i="1067" txt_f="1249">This mixed methods study involves the development and evaluation of three modules of continuing education, Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3.

Therefore, in clinical practice, it is important to maximise the opportunities to deliver this education across the spectrum of the primary health care setting. In light of this, it is important to explore the way in which pharmacists can work with other HCPs, in particular medical prescribers (general medical practitioners [GPs]) in delivering consistent and repeated inhaler technique education to patients, over time. In addressing this clinical practice problem, there is a need to develop and evaluate effective interprofessional education, which will both i) address the need to educate patients in the correct use of their inhalers as well as ii) equip HCPs with the skills to engage in collaborative relationships with each other. If this can be achieved, issues of medical management, which require long-term and repeated intervention, can be addressed collaboratively.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10311" xml_f="10581" txt_i="4424" txt_f="4694">In considering interprofessional learning (IPL) it is well recognised that just like interprofessional practice, IPL is a complex field of research.

Most significant are the financial costs associated with such a large longitudinal study. The financial burden was not only restricted to the participation of health care professionals over a long period of time, but also to the development of multimedia educational resources e.g. the Model 2 Online learning module and the ”Correct Use of Inhaler Devices” DVD. A large proportion of the budgetary requirement was attributed to the development of the online Patient Log. In addition to the financial expense of the Patient Log, its development was further restricted by its necessity to comply with industry requirements and the research framework. As a data collection tool, the Patient Log was a platform that would be unfamiliar to study participants and potentially confusing. Strategies to reduce the impact of this challenge included group and one on one training on the use of the Patient Log as well as the availability of instant support via a telephone hotline.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42456" xml_f="43018" txt_i="33058" txt_f="33620">Further challenges in the study included mirroring the educational content of the Models in three different learning styles. This was strongly challenged in the development of Model 2, the online learning model.
