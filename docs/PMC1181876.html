Efficacy data were evaluated using a per-protocol analysis, which only included patients with treatment outcomes. Prior to completion of this study we decided that a per-protocol analysis would be more appropriate than an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Our protocol was used to study CQ + SP versus AQ + SP at three additional sites prior to the completion of the studies presented here. During the analysis of these previous studies we decided that a per-protocol analysis provided better estimates of the true risk of treatment outcomes than an ITT analysis, as in an ITT analysis one must assign treatment outcomes to patients who did not complete the study. In addition, there were so few patients enrolled who did not complete the study at all our sites that the comparative results using a per-protocol analysis did not differ from that using an ITT analysis. Primary efficacy outcomes included the 28-d risks for all recurrent infection (ETF, LCF, or LPF), recrudescence (all ETF and any LCF or LPF categorized as recrudescence based on genotyping results), and new infections (any LCF or LPF categorized as new infection based on genotyping results). Risks of recrudescence and new infection were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit formula with censoring for the competing risk (new infections censored when estimating risks of recrudescence and vice versa). Secondary outcomes included the risk of recurrent infection unadjusted by genotyping at day 14, presence of fever on days 1–3, parasitemia on days 2 and 3, change in hemoglobin level between the day of enrollment and the last day of follow-up, presence of gametocytes during any follow-up day, and the incidence of adverse events. Pairwise comparisons of treatment efficacy were made using risk differences with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

It has also been argued that recrudescences are more difficult to treat than new infections. We could not address this issue in this study as patients were not assessed following repeat therapy.

Based on the results of this study and others, Uganda has recently opted to replace CQ + SP with artemether-lumefantrine, joining many other African countries in choosing an ACT as first-line therapy. However, cost and availability of ACTs remain major concerns, and it appears that the sudden increase in demand for artemisinins may exacerbate these problems, at least in the short-term [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0020190-b05" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="45844" xml_f="45845" txt_i="33456" txt_f="33457">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45852" xml_f="46273" txt_i="33457" txt_f="33878">]. The inexpensive and widely available combination AQ + SP may still be appropriate for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in areas where resistance to the drugs is relatively uncommon, in situations where ACT may not be feasible (e.g., such as the treatment of unconfirmed cases of malaria outside of the formal health sector), and, in the short term, while adequate supplies of ACT are not yet available in Africa.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title><offsets xml_i="46337" xml_f="46359" txt_i="33880" txt_f="33902">Supporting Information</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd001"><label><offsets xml_i="46435" xml_f="46446" txt_i="33903" txt_f="33914">Protocol S1</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="46470" xml_f="46487" txt_i="33914" txt_f="33931">CONSORT Checklist</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="46498" xml_f="46510" txt_i="33932" txt_f="33944">(58 KB DOC).</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020190.sd001.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="46579" xml_f="46615" txt_i="33945" txt_f="33981">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd002"><label><offsets xml_i="46730" xml_f="46741" txt_i="33982" txt_f="33993">Protocol S2</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="46765" xml_f="46816" txt_i="33993" txt_f="34044">Combination Therapies for Treatment of Complicated </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="46824" xml_f="46834" txt_i="34044" txt_f="34054">falciparum</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="46843" xml_f="46911" txt_i="34054" txt_f="34122"> Malaria in Uganda: Evaluation of Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="46922" xml_f="46935" txt_i="34123" txt_f="34136">(1.0 MB DOC).</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020190.sd002.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="47004" xml_f="47040" txt_i="34137" txt_f="34173">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><boxed-text id="pmed-0020190-box1" position="float"><sec id="sb1"><title><offsets xml_i="47160" xml_f="47175" txt_i="34174" txt_f="34189">Patient Summary</offsets></title><sec id="sb1a"><title><offsets xml_i="47205" xml_f="47215" txt_i="34190" txt_f="34200">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47226" xml_f="47704" txt_i="34201" txt_f="34679">As resistance to current malarial regimens grows, it is increasingly important to find new combinations of drugs that will not only treat an ongoing infection, but will also prevent recurrence of the malaria (either a new infection or reappearance of the treated infection).
