The power of the follow-up study is likely to be substantially increased beyond that estimation by the availability of women's earlier EPDS and SF-36 scores and the inclusion of these earlier scores as covariates in the analysis of health outcomes.

Trends in the proportions of women depressed over the 12 months will also be assessed because, if the intervention is effective, its effectiveness is likely to be cumulative, so that an appropriate analysis would compare changes over time in the intervention and comparison communities. Analysis of the SF-36 will also take into account clustering and change over time. It is likely that the analysis will require hierarchical modelling. We recognise that there is continuing development and debate about the appropriate methods of analysis for cluster-randomised trials and the research team will continue to monitor these developments for the purposes of refining the proposed data analysis.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="45036" xml_f="45050" txt_i="36995" txt_f="37009">Ethical issues</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="45061" xml_f="45098" txt_i="37010" txt_f="37047">The key ethical issues in randomised </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="45106" xml_f="45115" txt_i="37047" txt_f="37056">clinical </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="45124" xml_f="45135" txt_i="37056" txt_f="37067">trials are:</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45142" xml_f="45289" txt_i="37068" txt_f="37215">• a worthwhile question in terms of the size of the problem addressed and its associated mortality, morbidity, disability or resource implications;</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45296" xml_f="45563" txt_i="37216" txt_f="37483">• informed consent to participation, including consent to randomisation, with the additional proviso that consent may be withdrawn at any time, and that the care provided by the agency/institution and its staff will not be influenced by decisions about participation;</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45570" xml_f="45636" txt_i="37484" txt_f="37550">• genuine uncertainty about the effectiveness of the intervention;</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45643" xml_f="45705" txt_i="37551" txt_f="37613">• an assessment of the intervention as unlikely to be harmful;</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45712" xml_f="45796" txt_i="37614" txt_f="37698">• an adequate sample size to identify the pre-specified effects of the intervention;</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45803" xml_f="45877" txt_i="37699" txt_f="37773">• prior systematic review of any previous trials or similar interventions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45884" xml_f="45923" txt_i="37774" txt_f="37813">The application of these principles to </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="45931" xml_f="45940" txt_i="37813" txt_f="37822">community</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="45949" xml_f="46877" txt_i="37822" txt_f="38750">-based trials is relatively straightforward, and PRISM satisfies all but one of the above criteria. The issue of informed consent is more complex in community-randomised trials. Formal consent to randomisation and to implementation will be sought from local government authorities (LGAs) on behalf of the population they are responsible for, and the staff they employ, within a Memorandum of Understanding between the LGA and La Trobe University. Women will be sent a postal questionnaire six months and two years after the birth, with a covering letter making it clear that they do not have to return it. If they do complete the questionnaire that is taken as consent.

The second was a lower adjusted response fraction to the outcome questionnaire than to earlier population-based surveys of recent mothers in Victoria.
