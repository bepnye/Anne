The study is designed to test the hypotheses that patients receiving CSC will have a better clinical outcome and experience fewer harmful treatment practices from the CAPs than patients receiving CAU at 6 months after study entry. An estimated sample of 296 participants will be recruited from across 51 clusters, with a cluster consisting of a primary care clinic and its neighboring CAP facilities. CSC is a manualized intervention package consisting of regular and scheduled visits of PHCPs to CAP facilities to assist with the management of trial participants. Assistance includes the administration of antipsychotic medications, management of comorbid physical condition, assisting the CAP to avoid harmful treatment practices, and engaging with CAPs, caregivers and participants in planning discharge and rehabilitation. The primary outcome, assessed at 6 months following trial entry, is improvement on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). Secondary outcomes, assessed at 3 and 6 months, consist of levels of disability, experience of harmful treatment practices and of victimization, and levels of perceived stigma and of caregivers’ burden.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9642" xml_f="9652" txt_i="2085" txt_f="2095">Discussion</offsets></title><p id="Par3"><offsets xml_i="9673" xml_f="9966" txt_i="2096" txt_f="2389">Information about whether collaboration between orthodox and complementary health providers is feasible and can lead to improved outcome for patients is important to formulating policies designed to formally engage the services of traditional and faith healers within the public health system.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9988" xml_f="10006" txt_i="2391" txt_f="2409">Trial registration</offsets></title><p id="Par4"><offsets xml_i="10027" xml_f="10086" txt_i="2410" txt_f="2469">National Institutes of Health Clinical Trial registry, ID: </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/"><offsets xml_i="10157" xml_f="10168" txt_i="2469" txt_f="2480">NCT02895269</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="10179" xml_f="10207" txt_i="2480" txt_f="2508">.

That is, a cluster has one PHC and its neighboring CAP facilities, the number of the latter being determined by distance, ease of contact, and administrative considerations. Clusters were composed such that the CAP facilities are readily accessible to the PHCW in order to facilitate clinical engagement and support. All CAP facilities in the two study sites, previously identified and mapped during the formative stage of the project, were allocated to clusters. A total of 51 clusters were composed. Randomization of clusters was carried out before recruitment of trial participants (TPs). Allocation of clusters to each of the study arms was conducted by a statistician at the University of Ibadan (UI) Department of Epidemiology and Statistics with no other involvement in the day-to-day implementation of the study. Allocation to the two arms was balanced by site (Ghana versus Nigeria) and by size of the cluster, using the number of beds in each cluster (small versus large).

CAPs, in the course of delivering care to persons with severe mental health disorders, including psychotic disorders, may use what can be regarded as potentially harmful or abusive approaches. These approaches are largely informed by their understanding of the nature of psychosis by CAPs and by the need to curtail difficult clinical situations. For example, CAPs might believe that patients who are aggressive are possessed of evil spirits and that physically beating such patients might drive out the spirits. Also, in handling patients who are violent and at risk of harm to self or to others, CAPs might feel the need to shackle such patients to restrict their movements and the attendant risk of violence. All of these possible scenarios that might lead to the use of harmful or abusive practices are addressed within COSIMPO through training of the providers, as described in this protocol, and through the implementation of the collaboration with PHCPs who are able to administer medications to calm agitated and potentially violent patients.</offsets></p><p id="Par86"><offsets xml_i="37901" xml_f="38607" txt_i="25911" txt_f="26617">There is need to reduce risks to all the TPs (in both intervention and control arms) as much as possible while getting the scientific and socially valuable information the study has potential to offer.

The study is designed to provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of this approach in responding to the treatment gap for severe mental disorders. The promise of the trial is not only in regard to providing such evidence, but in also determining to what extent a collaborative shared care between traditional and faith healers, on the one hand, and primary health care workers, on the other hand, can lead to a reduction in the use of potentially harmful treatment practices by the former.

The entry point to treatment for patients will be from the traditional healers or faith healers (i.e., CAPs). The CAPs take responsibility for the patient and commence treatment. The contract to care for the patient therefore lies with the CAP. The discretion about when to seek clinical support from or refer to the PHCP also lies with the CAP. The PHCP in turn provides the necessary support and assistance needed. In providing clinical support to the CAP, the PHCP may engage with the CAP, the patient, and caregivers of the patient. Beyond specific referrals and consultations, the PHCP will maintain regular weekly scheduled personal contacts with the CAPs as part of the collaboration, using such contacts to reinforce information on best clinical practice, provide information on patient rehabilitation, and attend to other clinical issues that the CAPs may bring to the attention of the PHCP.</offsets></p><p id="Par125"><offsets xml_i="67123" xml_f="68855" txt_i="51891" txt_f="53623">The results of our formative work with CAPs showed that their treatment modalities can be broadly grouped into (1) harmful, (2) innocuous and (3) possibly helpful. Harmful practices include shackling, beating/physical assaults, scarification, imposed long periods of fasting (starvation) and isolation. PHCPs will discourage these practices and offer to assist in managing patients who are being exposed to such practices, possibly as a result of the severity or challenging nature of their illness. During on-going engagement with the CAPs, PHCPs will always be mindful of the need for sensitivity, respect and avoiding undermining the authority of the CAPs. Innocuous practices are not harmful to the patients and very often reflect deep cultural and religious beliefs shared by both patients/relatives and CAPs. Examples include the use of sacrifices and rituals. PHCPs will be trained and encouraged to remain open-minded about the use of innocuous practices and to leave deeply held belief systems undisturbed provided that they do not have the potential to result in harm. Possibly helpful practices within the CAM system include the use of herbs, animal products and minerals. For the purpose of potential referral/consultations to the PHCP, it is important that PHCPs are aware of the content and side effects of herbs, so as to be able to manage them if the need arises. For this reason, CAPs who use herbs will be encouraged to provide the names of the herbs. Research team will seek to obtain the active ingredients of such herbs from the literature. PHCPs will be provided with this information as well as ways to respond to any adverse events in the patients who are administered such herbs and take appropriate action.</offsets></p><p id="Par126"><offsets xml_i="68874" xml_f="69741" txt_i="53624" txt_f="54491">Cluster randomized controlled trials have peculiar challenges. One of such challenges is that of possible contamination. This was minimized in this study by stratifying eligible and consenting clusters by LGA before allocation to the CSC or the CAU arm using a computer-generated random number sequence, thus avoiding contiguous clusters being in the same arm. Furthermore, the availability of collaboration in the CSC arm was not publicized to other CAPs. The stratification of the clusters also took account of size, thus limiting the potential limitation of differential recruitment into the arms of the study. We have continued to monitor the recruitment of participants into the arms. Subsample selection bias has been avoided in this study by recruiting all eligible and consenting participants from randomized clusters, thus maintaining the power of the study.</offsets></p><sec id="Sec31"><title><offsets xml_i="69768" xml_f="69780" txt_i="54492" txt_f="54504">Trial status</offsets></title><p id="Par127"><offsets xml_i="69803" xml_f="69970" txt_i="54505" txt_f="54672">The protocol version number is 14.0 submitted on the 7th December, 2016.

Patients who meet all of the eligibility criteria, including have a PANSS score of ≥ 60, proceed to the next stage of the enrollment procedure. Following screening and confirmation of eligibility by the RAs, a potential participant is assessed for capacity to consent by an independent social worker who has been trained to conduct such assessment. Potential participants who are deemed to have capacity are approached for consent following the provision of full trial information by the RAs. For eligible patients who are found to lack capacity to consent, a caregiver is approached to provide proxy consent. If the caregiver provides consent on behalf of the patient, the latter is still required to give assent before they are enrolled into the trial. The consenting procedure of any non-literate patient or caregiver has to be the signed confirmation of an independent adult and literate witness before enrollment is deemed to have been completed. Baseline assessments of consented participants are conducted within 3 days of enrollment while outcome assessments are conducted at 3 and 6 months following trial entry.</p><p id="Par133">All Consent Forms are being administered in the local language translations.
