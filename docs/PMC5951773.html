Admittedly, the study evaluated trainee performance in only one patient case, whereas broader experience with several cases presumably would have affected the outcomes in both knowledge retention and participants’ learning experience.

This format could be developed for multiple trainers and possibly for inter-professional learning, since the VP’s interactive contextualization and visualization of the accident history, combined with the application of assessment tools and clinical procedures, might play an important role for learning. However, further work needs to be done to evaluate the use of VP format for inter-professional learning. The study supports the use of VP in medical education as complementing traditional teaching formats. Policy makers in medical education and training might find these conclusions relevant in defining new teaching strategies for improving training efficiency.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="29557" xml_f="29572" txt_i="21536" txt_f="21551">Acknowledgments</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29583" xml_f="29980" txt_i="21552" txt_f="21949">This study was supported by research grants from the Swedish Knowledge Foundation and the Stockholm County Council.
