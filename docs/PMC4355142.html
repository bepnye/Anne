Currently, little research exists on the safety and potential side effects of chronic consumption of PWS, and even less so involving female populations.

The pre-workout formula contained 1 g of carbohydrate, 23 mg of Calcium, and 5,700 mg of a proprietary blend consisting of beta-alanine, choline bitartrate, L-tyrosine, glycine, taurine, L-carnitine, beetroot extract, hawthorn berry powder, agmatine sulfate, caffeine anhydrous, and huperzine A.

While significant group by time interactions (p &lt; 0.05) were observed for absolute monocytes, MCH, creatinine, eGFR, and total cholesterol, all group values remained well within the accepted physiological range and were not clinically significant. While remaining within range, unusual effects were observed between groups. For instance, the CRL group decreased relative to G1 and G2 for absolute monocytes, and for MCH and total cholesterol, G1 increased relative to both CRL and G2. Similar to total cholesterol, although not reaching significance (p &gt; 0.05), both LDL and HDL increased in G1 but decreased in G2 over time. These findings are somewhat discrepant, since intuitively, one would think that if a lower dose increases a given parameter compared to control, then a higher dose should amplify this effect. This, however, was not the case. Such results suggest a natural variation in these clinical markers, and may not necessarily be related to supplementation. Additionally, the control group (n = 16) was larger than either of the experimental groups (G1, n = 10; G2, n = 8), so individual variations within the experimental groups had greater impact on the group mean values.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20375" xml_f="20814" txt_i="14787" txt_f="15226">Variables that were significantly different at the group level were evaluated at the individual level to determine clinical significance.

For creatinine, this occurred in three subjects, one from G1 and two from G2, wherein values decreased pre to post, bringing them within the clinical reference range. For total cholesterol, changes observed in two subjects from G1 and one from G2 exceeded the MD. Specifically, the two subjects from G1 increased over time, moving from within range to out of range, while the subject from G2 decreased pre to post, entering the accepted reference range. Also worth noting is the fact that three individuals from the CRL group experienced changes in total cholesterol values that both exceeded the MD and moved in or out of range. In this case, one subject increased over time to leave the accepted range, one started outside of the range and remained out of range, and one decreased pre to post, entering back into range. All subjects remained within 3 standard deviations of the mean and exceeded the MD. Collectively, individual analysis supports the present hypothesis and also supports the notion of intra-subject diurnal variability. Furthermore, absolute monocytes and total cholesterol were distributed differently pre to post, increasing the probability for a type 1 statistical error [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10"><offsets xml_i="22790" xml_f="22792" txt_i="17074" txt_f="17076">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22799" xml_f="22801" txt_i="17076" txt_f="17078">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22808" xml_f="22931" txt_i="17079" txt_f="17202">These findings generally agree with previous literature.
