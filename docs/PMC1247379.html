The risk of symptoms increased with increasing Cu exposure and decreased with time. The best model by counting-process analysis included Cu concentration and sex. The risk of symptoms remained significantly higher in women than in men during weeks 1–4 for all concentrations tested; at week 1 comparison with the &lt; 0.01-mg/L group showed that differences became significant in women at 4 mg/L [relative risk (RR) = 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–2.05), and in men at 6 mg/L (RR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.02–2.79). At week 2 for men and week 4 in women, the Cu concentration required to obtain significant differences on symptom report was &gt; 6 mg Cu/L.

Daily volume of water ingested was analyzed as “total water,” “mixed water” (infusions, soups, and others), and “plain water” (test water). Dependent variables were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and total gastrointestinal symptoms. All subjects were included in the analyses; when diaries were not completed, the data were labeled as “missing.” Statistical analysis included analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square test, and Fisher’s test. Hazard associated with Cu exposure was calculated by counting-process analysis using S-Plus 6.0 software for Windows (Insightful Corporation, Seattle WA, USA).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20033" xml_f="22468" txt_i="13379" txt_f="15814">Our initial approach was to analyze only those subjects in the randomized groups that followed the protocol instructions, thus generating data under quasi-experimental conditions. However, this omitted an important proportion of the information because many participants’ registered information was incomplete. We sought expert advice, and a post hoc data assessment led us to choose the counting process (S-Plus 6.0). This analysis did not follow the randomized groups but improved the assessment of the dose–response curve after controlled exposure, allowing individuals to remain present every time they recorded data; in the counting process, each subject is treated as an observation of a Poisson process. A censored subject is counted per event, that is, the time of symptom report, even when the rest of the data are incomplete; thus, all participants remained in the analyses and were counted as many times as they were at home, ingested test waters, and filled out their diaries. Proportional hazard models derived by this process allowed predicting hazard ratios for different exposures (Cu concentration measured in water at home) and covariate conditions. Model information used for dependent variable was start–stop for an event; the censoring variable was the report of outcome(s). Because the risk of event decreased after repeated exposure, data were stratified by the variable “time.” Seven-day risk intervals were generated; Cu concentration assigned to each interval and to each occurring event was the value obtained in the weekly measurement in home-prepared waters. Thus, the 1,365 individuals surveyed for 63 days yielded 85,995 person-days of exposure; the number of events detected resulted in a total of 13,354 risk intervals, which were used for the counting-process analysis. Covariates were sex, age, total daily fluid volume, volume ingested as plain water (on the day of event), volume ingested as mixed fluids (on the day of event), and the weekly Cu concentration value obtained from measures of home-prepared water. Multiple models were calculated to assess the potential effect of different covariate sets on the relative risk (RR) estimates for a given Cu concentration. In order to express the risk due to Cu exposure, holding other variables constant, we estimated the RR [95% confidence interval (CI)] due to an increase of Cu exposure and kept the no-exposure groups as the reference risk value.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title><offsets xml_i="22515" xml_f="22522" txt_i="15817" txt_f="15824">Results</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22542" xml_f="22590" txt_i="15825" txt_f="15873">Comparability of enrolled and censused families.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22601" xml_f="22709" txt_i="15874" txt_f="15982">Families and individuals that fulfilled entry criteria were assigned to the intervention groups as shown in </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0112-001068"><offsets xml_i="22754" xml_f="22762" txt_i="15982" txt_f="15990">Figure 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22769" xml_f="22942" txt_i="15990" txt_f="16163">.
