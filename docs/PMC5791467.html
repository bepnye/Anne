The release of prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators in the uterus is thought to be one of the primary causes of dysmenorrhea.

Increasing the level of prostaglandins leads to uterine contraction, uterine ischemia, and increased sensitivity to pain fibers and ultimately causes pelvic pain. Sports activity decreases the level of serum aldosterone by reducing the level of renin and increasing estrogen and progesterone and thus decreases and improves physical symptoms.[</offsets><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8591" xml_f="8592" txt_i="4467" txt_f="4468">7</offsets></xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8632" xml_f="8633" txt_i="4468" txt_f="4469">8</offsets></xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8673" xml_f="8674" txt_i="4469" txt_f="4470">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8681" xml_f="8706" txt_i="4470" txt_f="4495">] The study of Mohammadi </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="8714" xml_f="8719" txt_i="4495" txt_f="4500">et al</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="8728" xml_f="9008" txt_i="4500" txt_f="4780">. aimed at determining the effect of aerobic exercise on some of the menstrual symptoms of nonathlete students showed that with the regular and continuous exercise of aerobic exercise, early menstrual dysmenorrhea and severe menstrual bleeding can be controlled or Preventing it.[</offsets><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9042" xml_f="9044" txt_i="4780" txt_f="4782">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9051" xml_f="9062" txt_i="4782" txt_f="4793">] Shavandi </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="9070" xml_f="9075" txt_i="4793" txt_f="4798">et al</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="9084" xml_f="9548" txt_i="4798" txt_f="5262">. examined the effect of an isometric exercise on primary dysmenorrhea, and concluded that, given the positive effect of isometric exercise exercises on primary dysmenorrhea as an important problem for female student students that led to absenteeism from the classroom and Isometric exercise is a useful method for this age group, and it is possible to spend isometric exercises anywhere without spending money to reduce the complications of primary dysmenorrhea.[</offsets><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9582" xml_f="9584" txt_i="5262" txt_f="5264">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9591" xml_f="9592" txt_i="5264" txt_f="5265">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9599" xml_f="9628" txt_i="5266" txt_f="5295">However, according to Blakey </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="9636" xml_f="9641" txt_i="5295" txt_f="5300">et al</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="9650" xml_f="9893" txt_i="5300" txt_f="5543">.

The results of this study showed that 8 weeks of aerobic exercise significantly improved the severity of pain in the primary dysmenorrhea in the intervention group compared to the control group. Findings from various studies indicate that exercise therapy and physical activity are related to decreasing dysmenorrhea. According to research, sports exercises with increased premenstrual pelvic blood flow, the onset of prostaglandin accumulation in this area delayed the onset of pain; exercise during pain can lead to faster transfer of wastes and prostaglandins (which is the main cause of menstrual pain) from the uterus. On the other hand, regular exercise plays an important role in reducing stress and helps improve blood circulation and increases levels of endorphins and nerve transducers. As a result, dysmenorrhea decreases the blood flow to the uterus. Inhibition of stress is one of the most common causes of the relationship between exercise and menstruation.[</offsets><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="19457" xml_f="19459" txt_i="14455" txt_f="14457">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19466" xml_f="19467" txt_i="14457" txt_f="14458">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19474" xml_f="19483" txt_i="14459" txt_f="14468">Shavandi </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="19491" xml_f="19496" txt_i="14468" txt_f="14473">et al</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="19505" xml_f="19816" txt_i="14473" txt_f="14784">. also examined the effect of 8 weeks of isometric exercises on primary dysmenorrhea in female students, and concluded that performing isometric exercises (including abdominal, pelvic and groin enhancement exercises) in reducing the severity and duration of pain and the rate of use of medication is effective.[</offsets><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="19850" xml_f="19852" txt_i="14784" txt_f="14786">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19859" xml_f="19876" txt_i="14786" txt_f="14803">] Also, Chantler </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="19884" xml_f="19889" txt_i="14803" txt_f="14808">et al</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="19898" xml_f="20061" txt_i="14808" txt_f="14971">. showed that exercising due to the release of endorphins, relaxation, stress relief and improved blood flow can reduce the severity and duration of dysmenorrhea.[</offsets><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="20095" xml_f="20097" txt_i="14971" txt_f="14973">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20104" xml_f="20116" txt_i="14973" txt_f="14985">] Mohammadi </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="20124" xml_f="20129" txt_i="14985" txt_f="14990">et al</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="20138" xml_f="20361" txt_i="14990" txt_f="15213">. also examined the effect of aerobic exercise on some menstrual symptoms of nonathletic students, and concluded that regular and continuous aerobic exercises can control initial dysmenorrhea and severe menstrual bleeding,[</offsets><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="20394" xml_f="20395" txt_i="15213" txt_f="15214">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20402" xml_f="20680" txt_i="15214" txt_f="15492">] Which was consistent with the results of the present study.

Performing favorite things, listening to music, meditating, self-hypnosis, and exercising have been introduced as treatments for stress management. Exercise can reduce stress by reducing the sympathetic nervous activity and increasing the activity of parasympathetic nerves during rest while reducing the symptoms of menstruation. In fact, the degree to which people respond to pain is different. This phenomenon is partly due to the ability of the brain to suppress the input signals of the brain by the pain control system.[</offsets><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="22400" xml_f="22402" txt_i="16910" txt_f="16912">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22409" xml_f="22648" txt_i="16912" txt_f="17151">] Therefore, differences in findings may be due to individual differences in the amount of pain perception.
