This hypotension is readily managed by volume expansion and administration of vasoactive agents.

With xenon, the pressure profile is quite different, with a later and more important rise of blood pressure, requiring in some patients an increase of remifentanil concentration, or administration of nicardipine. This hypertension with xenon was previously described as frequent, and its mechanism needs to be clarified. A sympathetic activation cannot be a definitive explanation because a bradycardia (50 to 60 b/min) was always associated to the operation. Xenon- induced hypertension may confound the clinician’s understanding of the depth of anesthesia and therefore some sort of cerebral function monitoring indicative of the depth of anesthesia should be employed. Another hemodynamic observation was a stable bradycardia observed even in patients not treated with a b-blocking agent. This phenomenon cannot be related to the increase in remifentanil concentrations as it appeared previously. It does not receive a definitive physiopathological explanation at the moment. An activation of the parasympathic system could be hypothesized.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20144" xml_f="20403" txt_i="13698" txt_f="13957">We did not consider as an objective of this study the incidence of postoperative neurological events because they are rare (near 1%) in patients scheduled for carotid surgery.

The main measurement of this study was the variation of SrcO2, a non-invasive but relevant parameter of the cerebral perfusion. Cerebral perfusion monitoring has been shown of interest under general anesthesia during endarterectomy. Amongst all the monitoring systems available, most of them used for several years, none is perfect. They all present limits that could be logistic or concerning their reliability. Transcranial Doppler is unfeasible for anatomical reasons in up to 20% of the patients, EEG and monitoring of the somaesthetic potential can have a poor sensitivity andor a poor specificity, while they are perturbed by agents of anesthesia, measurement of stump pressure is poorly sensitive in indicating the need of a shunt, while furthermore, it is only a punctual measure during a test of clamping, influenced by numerous factors such as arterial pressure, PaCO2 and agents of anesthesia [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><offsets xml_i="21931" xml_f="21933" txt_i="15408" txt_f="15410">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21940" xml_f="22165" txt_i="15410" txt_f="15635">].

Nevertheless, monitoring of SrcO2, can allow improvement of hemodynamic status in patients with high cerebral risk. Under xenon, we noted that, compared with a conventional general anesthesia, decline of SrcO2 at clamping is less important and is observed in fewer patients. This result is in agreement with the hypothesis of a neuroprotection conferred by this molecule. The neuroprotection may be related in part to a better respect of cerebral perfusion andor its regulation. Xenon’s effects on cerebral perfusion and metabolism are quite complex. Its neuroprotective effect is caused by enhanced ischemic tolerance. Moreover, the connection between neuroprotection and increased perfusion is quite hypothetical.

These neuroprotective properties imply complex mechanisms involving: inhibition on the N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, decrease of the glutamate, opening of potassium channels (TREK), comparable to a preconditioning against the ischemic effects.
