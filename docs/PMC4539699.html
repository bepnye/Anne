In modern orthopedic surgery, less invasive, tissue-sparing techniques have been introduced and patients are operated upon using shorter acting anesthetics. Nowadays, surgery duration is shorter and patients are being mobilized early after surgery. These factors possibly contribute to less loss of muscle strength after surgery, resulting in a more stable hip joint immediately postoperative. Postoperative joint stability is further enhanced by the use of larger diameter femoral head components.

During this mobilization patients are instructed how turn in bed and how to prevent more than 90 degrees of hip flexion and 45 degrees of rotation. The only difference in instruction between the two study arms is the sleeping position. When discharged to home or nursing home, patients receive a booklet describing the instructions relevant to the study arm they are assigned to. This booklet serves as an enchiridion for partners, physiotherapists, and other persons involved in the care of the patient. In addition, patients are handed a standardized diary booklet in which they are asked to document their sleeping position, exercise activities, experience of pain and any further comments they may want to convey. Patient will visit the outpatient clinic preoperatively and then at 8 postoperative weeks. Routine physical examination will be performed by the orthopedic surgeon. All scores and measurements will be recorded by the nurse practitioner who will also collect the diary booklet from the patients. Preoperative functional assessment will be done by pain severity (Visual Analogue Scale: range 0–10), hip function (Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) and quality of life (EQ-5D). At 8 weeks follow-up the same functional assessment will be recorded by the nurse practitioner. This visit is combined with the regular postoperative control by the orthopedic surgeon. At 6, 12 and 24 months there will be follow-up questionnaires by Email, paper or telephone depending upon the availability of the patients’ Email addresses. The primary outcome: dislocations within the first 8 weeks, will be recorded in the patient’s file when visiting the emergency department.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title><offsets xml_i="21403" xml_f="21426" txt_i="15393" txt_f="15416">Sample size calculation</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21437" xml_f="21675" txt_i="15417" txt_f="15655">The maximum allowable difference in proportion in which there is still equality in the effect is not known in the literature.
