Eligible and consenting participants (aged 18 years or older) will be randomised in equal numbers to either a BI delivered by 17 community pharmacists or a non-intervention control condition. The intervention will be a brief motivational discussion to support a reduction in alcohol consumption and will take approximately 10 minutes to deliver. Participants randomised to the control arm will be given an alcohol information leaflet with no opportunity for discussion. Study pharmacists will be volunteers who respond to an invitation to participate, sent to all community pharmacists in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. Participating pharmacists will receive 7 hours training on trial procedures and the delivery of BI. Pharmacy support staff will also receive training (4 hours) on how to approach and inform pharmacy customers about the study, with formal trial recruitment undertaken by the pharmacist in a consultation room. At three month follow up, alcohol consumption and related problems will be assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) administered by telephone.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5205" xml_f="5215" txt_i="1438" txt_f="1448">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5226" xml_f="5506" txt_i="1449" txt_f="1729">The UK Department of Health’s stated aim is to involve community pharmacists in the delivery of BI to reduce alcohol harms.

This will be the first RCT study to assess the effectiveness of BI delivered by community pharmacists and given this policy context, it is pragmatic in design. This setting attracts hazardous and harmful drinkers who are accessing community pharmacy services. There are minimal exclusion criteria, for example by not excluding those with co-morbidities, so the study population is similar as possible to those BIs would be delivered to if found to be effective.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29490" xml_f="29965" txt_i="22109" txt_f="22584">The time available for pharmacists’ training (a morning on trial procedures and an afternoon on BI delivery with additional provision for a two hour evening follow-up) was negotiated mindful of time pressures and other commitments. Pharmacists will be reimbursed for their one day of training, and given a modest fee given for each trial participant. Similarly the duration of the BI has been tailored to the time available for interventions delivery in community pharmacies.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29972" xml_f="30462" txt_i="22585" txt_f="23075">One possible consequence of these study design decisions is that a null finding may result because the effect of BI has been diluted by these study characteristics. We do not anticipate that setting-specific factors will interfere with intervention conduct, and the capacity of pharmacists to deliver BIs effectively is what we are studying. Although the primary care evidence-base is well established, there are many important questions about BI effectiveness that remain to be addressed

An evaluation of a stronger intervention or with more extended training and skills development inputs may show greater effectiveness and an efficacy trial may show more promise. We are aware of these possibilities and have made our study design decisions as we judge most appropriate in the policy context described. If the trial produces evidence of effectiveness then it will be appropriate to subsequently undertake a large multi-centre trial evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this BI model to inform decision-making about the delivery of BIs in pharmacies nationally.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="31162" xml_f="31175" txt_i="23677" txt_f="23690">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31186" xml_f="31686" txt_i="23691" txt_f="24191">ANCOVA: Analysis of covariance;AUDIT: Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test;BI: Brief Intervention;CLRN: Comprehensive Local Research Network;NHS: National Health Service;NIHR CSP: National Institute of Health Research Co-ordinated System for obtaining National Health Service Permission;NRES: National Research Ethics Services;REC: Research Ethics Committee;SASQ: Single Alcohol Screening Question;UK: United Kingdom;UKCRN: United Kingdom Central Research Network;W.H.O: World Health Organisation</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="31708" xml_f="31727" txt_i="24193" txt_f="24212">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31738" xml_f="31796" txt_i="24213" txt_f="24271">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="31818" xml_f="31840" txt_i="24273" txt_f="24295">Authors’ contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31851" xml_f="32395" txt_i="24296" txt_f="24840">RD, JM, IJN and CW designed the study.
