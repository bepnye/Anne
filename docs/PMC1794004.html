The eHealth literacy model includes six types of literacy, and thus each skill would require independent measurement, such as rigorous usability tests of standard computer equipment for computer literacy and reading aloud text passages to assess basic prose literacy. For health practitioners and consumers alike, such detailed assessment would be problematic in practice; however, it is worthwhile considering ways to conduct such measures in the future.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33086" xml_f="33097" txt_i="23578" txt_f="23589">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33108" xml_f="33972" txt_i="23590" txt_f="24454">The need for skills in seeking, appraising, and applying lessons learned through use of eHealth resources is common across ages, genders, and cultural groups, and thus the potential applicability of the eHEALS as a standard assessment tool for gauging eHealth literacy in health care is high. Assessing consumers’ comfort in using eHealth allows for the identification of skill gaps and can better assist those with low comfort levels in taking advantage of the potential benefits that eHealth can afford. Doing so may foster development of tools that can meet these needs and aid in creating appropriate strategies for bridging the digital divide in consumer health care quality. Only by increasing the understanding of the disparities between available eHealth tools and consumers’ abilities to use them can the necessary steps towards eliminating them be taken.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Oonagh Maley for her assistance in the planning and delivery of this study.
