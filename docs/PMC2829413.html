To assess the primary efficacy endpoint, lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglyceride levels were measured during the dietary lead-in period, at randomization, and 6 weeks after treatment. Additionally, levels of apolipoprotein A-1 and B, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), insulin, glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were measured at randomization and at 6 weeks after treatment. LDL-C levels were calculated using the Friedewald equation (LDL-C = total cholesterol - (HDL-C + triglyceride/5).
