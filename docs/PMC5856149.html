However, if type 2 diabetes is considered a manifestation of insulin resistance, the evidence is less clear.

However, sex was not included as a coefficient in regression, so these findings are incomplete, and further study is warranted. The present study was designed to examine factors that are associated with changes in insulin resistance in response to a 6-month behavioral weight loss intervention in overweight and obese men and women.

While all participants in the study were given the same guidance on physical activity as a component of the weight loss intervention, it is possible that men focused on different aspects of exercise than women, which may have impacted their HOMA-IR in a different way.

A limitation is that the proportion of men to women in the study was not equal, limiting the statistical power to test interactions. The sample population was free-living, which limits the collection of details on individual diets and exercise patterns and allows for variability in adherence.

This may mean that insulin resistant men require more aggressive intervention than women to prevent progression to metabolic syndrome or diabetes. Future larger diet studies with more balanced male-to-female ratios are needed to better elucidate the underlying explanation for this difference between men and women, and to further investigate if it holds true across age ranges and between races.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><p>The authors thank Drs.
