Midazolam is not only a medication with sedative and anti-anxiety effects that will increase child’s cooperation, but also is a muscle relaxant which can have effects similar to the spasmolytic agents, such as glucagon. On the other hand, it can improve amnesia and restore child’s memory from stressful procedures such as Intussusception reduction. This effect makes it superior to diazepam and proves the necessity of such a study.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title><offsets xml_i="7107" xml_f="7131" txt_i="3397" txt_f="3421">2.

Exclusion criteria included the presence of an underlying pathologic factor (Lead point) for Intussusception, passage of more than 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, the presence of signs of peritonitis or bowel perforation, dehydration, lethargy, history of a known gastrointestinal disease such as celiac disease or cystic fibrosis, history of a chronic hypoxic pulmonary disease, cyanotic heart disease, history of previous intussusception and the history of allergy to benzodiazepines. After obtaining written informed consent from the parents (Clinical Trial Registry Number: IRCT138904264395N1), 32 eligible patients were randomly assigned (every second one) to the study and control groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8042" xml_f="9359" txt_i="4316" txt_f="5633">Five minutes before reduction, 5 mg per mil of intravenous Midazolam, at the concentration of 0.1mg, which was determined based on body weight and was prepared by Elixir Company (up to 3 mg) was infused to the patients of the study group under supervision of an anesthesiologist. Then, reduction with barium under fluoroscopy guidelines was applied to the patients. Before administration of intravenous Midazolam, the vital signs including heart rate, level of consciousness, respiration and blood pressure of patients were monitored and their arterial oxygen saturation were measured and recorded using a pulse oximeter. During the reduction operation by pulse oximeter, cardiac rhythm and arterial oxygen levels of patients were measured and duration of the reduction, the success of reduction, and patient’s cooperation during the process were recorded in a checklist for each patient. Reduction refers to a condition, in which the entry of barium into ileal loops is viewed in the graph. Failure refers to the stoppage of barium column, at least for 15 minutes, in a part of the colon. After performing the required assessments and reaching a stable condition, patients were transferred to the recovery room, and evaluated again by sonography (ultrasound) to check if the symptoms of intussusception are remained.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9366" xml_f="10186" txt_i="5634" txt_f="6454">For an additional precaution, emergency resuscitation equipment, including oxygen ambu bag and intubation devices were provided to the experiment group that received Midazolam; and flumazenil was used as an antagonist of Midazolam as needed. After successful reduction, the patients in the experiment group were observed for one hour in the recovery room. During this period, vital signs were monitored and pulse oximetry was performed as well. After full recovery from anesthesia, and ensuring that there were no complications, they were discharged from the unit of radiology and were transferred to the relevant unit. In case the operation failed (and, in some cases, after observing the patient for about 12 hours), they would be transferred to the operating room with the consent of the surgeon and anesthesiologist.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10193" xml_f="10682" txt_i="6455" txt_f="6944">In the control group, after taking IV line, ampule of sterile water was injected as placebo and the remaining reduction steps were performed in contrast to the experiment group.

DISCUSSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="13233" xml_f="13517" txt_i="9029" txt_f="9313">Intussusception has been always one of the most common causes of acute intestinal obstruction in children. If less invasive treatments such as reduction with enema are performed at the right time, cases leading to surgery and specific complications associated with it can be reduced (</offsets><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="13550" xml_f="13551" txt_i="9313" txt_f="9314">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13558" xml_f="14364" txt_i="9314" txt_f="10120">). In the present study, the role of Midazolam as a sedative medication for more effective reduction in intussusception in children was examined. Also, all patients received Midazolam before intussusception reduction through barium rectal, except for one patient, who had successful reduction. However, in the group that did not receive Midazolam, 5 patients had not successful reduction. Although in our study, the rate of reduction between the two groups was not statistically significant, given the small sample size in our study, the lack of statistical significance can be attributed to this reduction. Previous studies show different rates of the success of enema reduction. In a study in Tehran, Ghavami Adel et al. reported that the success rate of air enema in intussusception reduction is 71.4% (</offsets><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="14397" xml_f="14398" txt_i="10120" txt_f="10121">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14405" xml_f="14520" txt_i="10121" txt_f="10236">).

Given the success rate of about 85 percent in most previous studies, our study showed that the success rate of reduction can be increased through the use of Midazolam before intravenous reduction. However, in the study conducted by Franken et al., it was shown that glucagon did not influence the success rate significantly, but Midazolam which was first examined in our study, was associated with the success rate increased to 93.8% in the group receiving Midazolam.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15401" xml_f="15800" txt_i="10948" txt_f="11347">In the present study, the average reduction time in the group receiving Midazolam was 34.8±11.35 minutes and in the group receiving distilled water was 32.37±19.2 minute. Therefore, the reduction times did not significantly differ. In the study conducted by Franken et al., the use of intravenous glucagon as a relaxant for smooth muscles of the intestinal wall had no effect on the reduction time (</offsets><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="15833" xml_f="15834" txt_i="11347" txt_f="11348">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15841" xml_f="16541" txt_i="11348" txt_f="12048">). In the present study, the mean duration of the procedure in the group receiving distilled water was slightly less than the group receiving Midazolam which perhaps reflects the carelessness in recording the exact duration of procedure. However, it seems that the use of Midazolam did not influence the duration of the procedure. Of course, ignoring other variables involved in the study, such as the skills of all the care team responsible for the reduction and characteristics of the patients can also be partly add to the total procedure time. Further studies with adequate sample sizes for the study of the effect of sedative medications on duration of intussusception reduction are recommended.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16548" xml_f="17361" txt_i="12049" txt_f="12862">Patient’s cooperation in the intussusception reduction process is very important to get the best outcome. Due to their young age and fear of therapeutic interventions and the nature of the disease that causes restlessness, children do not have good cooperation during reduction. Therefore, the use of sedative medications can be effective in increasing children’s involvement in the treatment process. In the present study, the opportunity to carry out two maneuvers of tapping and manipulation was used to examine the effectiveness of sedative medications. Tapping and manipulation were possible to be performed on 75% of patients who received Midazolam before reduction, whereas tapping and manipulation were possible to be performed only on 31.33% and 18.8% of the cases in the group receiving distilled water.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title><offsets xml_i="17395" xml_f="17408" txt_i="12864" txt_f="12877">5. CONCLUSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17419" xml_f="17962" txt_i="12878" txt_f="13421">The results of this study showed that the use of Midazolam significantly increases the cooperation and sedation levels in patients compared with the control group. It also showed that the use of Midazolam as a benzodiazepine with the known sedative and muscle relaxant effects can increase the success rate of enema reduction in intussusception in children. However, the use of Midazolam had no effect on the duration reduction.
