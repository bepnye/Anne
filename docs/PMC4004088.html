One example is the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), for which treatment can halt or partially improve vision loss if not delayed. Vision loss from new onset, neovascular disease occurs rapidly and unexpectedly, but is often undetected and has a worse prognosis if not treated immediately [</offsets><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7022" xml_f="7023" txt_i="2498" txt_f="2499">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7030" xml_f="7031" txt_i="2499" txt_f="2500">,</offsets><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7062" xml_f="7063" txt_i="2500" txt_f="2501">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7070" xml_f="7623" txt_i="2501" txt_f="3054">]. Thus AMD continues to be the leading cause of vision loss in those over age 60, primarily because many patients wait until they have suffered significant vision loss before making a decision to seek help. In order to optimize clinical outcomes, patients must take the initiative to routinely self-monitor their vision and present promptly upon new symptoms of vision loss. Seeking timely evaluation and treatment would help reduce the risk of damage to the fovea from neovascularization, which expands across the retina at 25 microns/day on average [</offsets><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7654" xml_f="7655" txt_i="3054" txt_f="3055">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7662" xml_f="7664" txt_i="3055" txt_f="3057">].</offsets></p><p id="P6"><offsets xml_i="7679" xml_f="8300" txt_i="3058" txt_f="3679">Delays in presentation to an eye care provider following the onset of neovascular AMD are attributable to a variety of factors, including lack of adherence with vision self-monitoring regimens, lack of confidence in recognizing symptoms of vision loss, and attributing vision loss to non-urgent or non-treatable causes due to the lack of awareness about AMD types, stages, risks and proper self-management strategies.

Thus, the suboptimal performance of the Amsler grid for detecting new-onset neovascularization may be related to multiple factors, such as perceptual completion phenomena, inconsistent fixation and/or poor compliance with regular monitoring by patients. More importantly, even when symptoms are observed when using the Amsler grid, a significant number of patients fail to self-refer, highlighting the need for a more holistic approach in the design of home monitoring solutions that address a broader scope of reasons for delay. Despite its drawbacks, the wide distribution of the Amsler grid is noteworthy since it demonstrates the feasibility of distributing low-tech, low-cost tools to very broad, large scale patient populations.</offsets></p><p id="P8"><offsets xml_i="10294" xml_f="11104" txt_i="5370" txt_f="6180">AMD patients may experience various initial symptoms after developing a neovascular lesion, including blurry vision, wavy lines, and/or colored or blank spots. These symptoms can be influenced by filling-in phenomena and can be intermittent, further adding to the patient’s lack of confidence regarding whether a true change in vision has occurred and requires immediate evaluation. Even after patients perceive a symptom as a visual change, they may incorrectly attribute it to non-urgent causes such as cataracts, a need for new glasses or non-neovascular AMD progression, creating another impediment to appropriate self-referral. A recent study showed that awareness of a diagnosis of AMD did not lead to better outcome in terms of visual acuity or lesion size among patients who developed neovascular AMD [</offsets><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="11135" xml_f="11136" txt_i="6180" txt_f="6181">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11143" xml_f="11597" txt_i="6181" txt_f="6635">]. Therefore, awareness of the diagnosis alone appears to be inadequate and broader interventions are needed to further educate patients about regular vision self-monitoring and appropriate self-referral when changes in vision are detected. One possible solution to address patients’ lack of knowledge of AMD symptoms and the disease process is to reinforce and supplement the eye care provider’s verbal instructions with a take-home educational journal.</offsets></p><p id="P9"><offsets xml_i="11612" xml_f="12166" txt_i="6636" txt_f="7190">The Vision and Memory Stimulating (VMS) journal was created as a low cost tool with the potential for broad distribution and possible successor of the Amsler grid. It was designed specifically to address three of the top reasons for patient delay in self-referral for treatment following newly developed loss of vision due to neovascular AMD. They are: (1) lack of adherence with self-monitoring regimens; (2) lack of confidence in self-monitoring symptoms of vision loss; and (3) lack of awareness of the disease, its risks and proper self care methods.</offsets></p><p id="P10"><offsets xml_i="12182" xml_f="13652" txt_i="7191" txt_f="8661">The VMS journal was designed through extensive AMD patient engagement, direct observation and feedback from AMD patients. It is intended to be used once each week to augment daily observations. The journal is presented in a large font, journal format with two new pages to complete every week and stickers to track completion. To overcome lack of adherence, the system incorporates a reminder-based journal approach to boost engagement and offers game-based visual acuity testing, as a vehicle to drive patient engagement. The VMS journal also provides weekly inspirational sayings and a pleasant graphical design, based upon preferences identified during AMD patient focus group interviews. To overcome lack of confidence in judging whether new visual symptoms have developed, the system includes multiple vision tests, each with clear instructions, simulated views of possible symptoms and a method for comparing vision against a baseline observation, with the aim that several vision tests would simultaneously confirm and reinforce patients’ observations. To improve lack of awareness of symptoms, understanding of risks, and proper self-care strategies, the system incorporates repetitive, consistent educational messages delivered at a level appropriate for easy cognitive understanding. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, to promote routine eye exams, the system has a feature to remind patients of follow-up appointment dates with their eye care professional.</offsets></p><p id="P11"><offsets xml_i="13668" xml_f="14196" txt_i="8662" txt_f="9190">A typical educational pamphlet would likely be read once or twice, then discarded and possibly forgotten, while the intent of the VMS journal is to deliver and reinforce consistent, educational messages repeatedly over time (i.e. the need to see a doctor after any perceived change in vision, facts about AMD disease progression, symptoms of vision loss, lifestyle changes to reduce risk of vision loss due to AMD).

Currently, the number of participants in our RCT who developed neovascular AMD or &gt;3 lines of VA loss is insufficient (i.e. ≤5 subjects) to form conclusions about the efficacy of the VMS to prevent vision loss.

To meet our large recruitment goal, it was also not feasible to perform informed consent, randomize and distribute the VMS journal in the eye care providers offices at the same time when usual care (Amsler grid) was provided.

Our ongoing research aims to demonstrate that this fundamental behavior change of increased vision self-monitoring frequency and confidence, coupled with the VMS journal’s clear, repetitive and consistent educational messages, will serve as a catalyst to overcome reasons for patient delay and reduce presentation time to the eye care provider after the development of vision changes due to neovascularization in AMD.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack id="S12"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p id="P36">
