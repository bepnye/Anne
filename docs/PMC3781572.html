In brief, it was a multinational randomized trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design that tested two pairs of interventions. Titrated basal insulin glargine was compared with standard stepwise oral therapy, and an omega-3 fatty acid supplement with placebo. Participants were required to have a prior cardiovascular (CV) event or other evidence of high CV risk together with documented dysglycemia, defined as either impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance (or the two together), or newly detected or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Participants with diabetes could be treated with lifestyle alone or accompanied by no more than a single oral glucose-lowering agent. The present analysis concerns the glycemic intervention, with use of omega-3 fatty acids included only as a covariate.

Investigators were advised not to prescribe insulin for standard participants unless they were on full doses of two or more oral agents, and if insulin was added, glargine was not to be used. Participants assigned to basal insulin glargine who were taking a thiazolidinedione prior to randomization stopped this medication but continued to take other glucose-lowering agents. Insulin glargine (Lantus; Sanofi) was added to their regimen starting at 2–6 units daily, based on fasting glucose levels. Participants were advised to inject the glargine in the evening and to self-titrate the dosage using a simple algorithm supported by the site investigators. Self-measured, plasma-referenced fasting capillary blood glucose tests were done at least twice-weekly to guide titration, with the goal of achieving and maintaining fasting glucose at ≤5.3 mmol/L (≤95 mg/dL). Other oral agents could be continued, reduced, or discontinued as judged appropriate during treatment with insulin glargine. The only oral agent that could be added (if not previously used) was metformin, which the site investigator initiated for individual participants if judged necessary to limit the risk of hypoglycemia. The importance of lifestyle management was periodically reinforced in both treatment groups.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s4"><title><offsets xml_i="9104" xml_f="9116" txt_i="5686" txt_f="5698">Measurements</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9127" xml_f="9915" txt_i="5699" txt_f="6487">In addition to self-measured glucose tests, venous blood for measurement of FPG and A1C at local laboratories was collected at intervals during treatment.

The present analysis expands this demonstration by examining the subpopulations with and without diabetes at baseline separately. In the subgroup without diabetes at baseline, there was a small increase of median A1C from 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) initially to 6.0% (42 mmol/mol) with standard care and to 5.8% (40 mmol/mol) with glargine after 5 years of follow-up. In those with diabetes at entry, median A1C decreased slightly from the 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) baseline after initiation of either glargine or standard care, and then it slowly increased with both treatments. After 5 years, the median A1C was 6.6% (49 mmol/mol) with standard care and 6.3% (45 mmol/mol) with glargine. Relative stability of A1C levels over time was not unexpected for the subpopulation without diabetes, but the finding that both treatment regimens had sustained success in people with overt diabetes at entry is reassuring.

The dosage of glargine was systematically adjusted, seeking FPG levels ≤5.3 mmol/L, and metformin could be added to mitigate the risk of hypoglycemia. Similarly, during standard therapy, oral medications were added and their dosage increased, with the aim of keeping A1C below either 6.5 or 7.0%, depending on locally accepted guidelines.

However, compared with the population in ORIGIN, participants in these studies had a longer duration of diabetes and in many cases established therapy with multiple glucose-lowering agents prior to enrollment. The A1C levels attained in ADVANCE (6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) and ACCORD (6.4% [46 mmol/mol]) were close to those at baseline in ORIGIN (6.5%), whereas those in VADT were slightly higher (6.9% [52 mmol/mol]). In all three studies, these values were achieved by strenuous efforts to improve control from higher A1C levels at baseline. Hence, maintenance of A1C at or below near-normal entry levels in ORIGIN contrasts with the other trials’ efforts to restore previously inadequate glycemic control.

Moreover, this effect was observed in subgroups representing characteristics that were associated with success in maintaining A1C &lt;6.5% for 5 years. This observation is not surprising given that an ambitious glycemic target for glargine titration, fasting glucose &lt;5.3 mmol/L, was systematically sought. Experience in ORIGIN showed that early use of this basal insulin was able to both attain and maintain this level of control of FPG, and thereby keep A1C from rising above baseline levels (median 6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) for a majority of people with overt diabetes at baseline for up to 5 years (5-year median 6.3% [45 mmol/mol], 60% of participants &lt;6.5%). However, the short- and long-term risks versus benefits of this method of treatment relative to standard care in ORIGIN are not yet well-defined.

Although maintenance of nearly normal glycemic control for 5 years may be predicted to delay the development of complications of diabetes, the present analysis lacks information about the predictors and consequences of hypoglycemia and other unwanted effects of insulin glargine relative to standard care.

Maintaining the mean of yearly A1C measurements at &lt;6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was more often accomplished when the initial A1C was lower and with titrated basal insulin glargine than with standard care.
