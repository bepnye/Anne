We pilot-tested with members of consumer organisation (Maternity Alliance) and in a convenience sample of pregnant and recently pregnant women.

And finally we formally pilot tested the decision aid with women who had a breech presentation in late pregnancy and were at the point of decision making. Pilot-testing results included: 95% of participants found the decision aid clear and easy to understand and 80% thought there was enough information for them to make a decision.

To allow for 10% loss to follow-up the sample size calculated above (84) is inflated by 10% to give the effective sample size of 92 women per arm and a total sample of 184 for the trial.

Involvement in decision making is a strong predictor of satisfaction with care in pregnancy and childbirth, yet there are only a few published decision aids for maternity care. A decision aid for the management of breech presentation is both timely and practical as there is new evidence supporting planned CS, dramatically altering the management options. Further, the randomised trial will provide high quality evidence about the effectiveness of the decision aid in supporting shared clinical decision making during pregnancy. If successful, the results of this project could be applied to improve consumer information and participation in clinical decisions across a wide spectrum of pregnancy care. Finally, if the decision aid increases the utilisation of ECV, in addition to reducing breech presentation and CS for breech presentation (and the associated increased hospitalisation and potential morbidities), some women may have more choice of where they give birth as breech presentation precludes birth in birth centres and small rural hospitals.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="40783" xml_f="40802" txt_i="32745" txt_f="32764">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40813" xml_f="40873" txt_i="32765" txt_f="32825">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="40895" xml_f="40917" txt_i="32827" txt_f="32849">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40928" xml_f="41222" txt_i="32850" txt_f="33144">CR, AB, CRG, BP, DHS were involved in the conception and design of the study.
