A major contributing factor is physical inactivity which is closely linked to bone health, cardiovascular disease risk, fitness and psychological factors. The school seems to provide an excellent setting to enhance levels of physical activity (PA). However, there is insufficient data from previous school-based intervention trials on how to enhance overall PA. It is also unknown whether an intervention aimed at increasing PA is effective in improving the children's health. The purpose of this paper is to outline the design of a school-based randomized, controlled trial (RCT) aiming to increase overall PA and to improve fitness and health in 6- to 13-year-old children.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5562" xml_f="5576" txt_i="805" txt_f="819">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5587" xml_f="5735" txt_i="820" txt_f="968">15 schools were randomized to the intervention (n = 9) or the control (n = 6) group, stratified by geographic region (urban vs. rural) and by age (1</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="5740" xml_f="5743" txt_i="968" txt_f="971">st </offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="5749" xml_f="5754" txt_i="971" txt_f="976">and 5</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="5759" xml_f="5762" txt_i="976" txt_f="979">th </offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="5768" xml_f="7179" txt_i="979" txt_f="2390">grade). Participation was given for all children in the intervention group since in this group the intervention was part of the normal school curriculum. The intervention during one academic year consisted of: 1. two additional physical education classes per week given by trained physical education teachers adding up to a total of five PA classes per week, 2. short PA breaks (2–5 min each) during academic lessons, 3. PA home work, and 4. adaptation of recreational areas around the school. All children underwent anthropometric measurements, blood pressure assessment, fitness testing, measurement of PA and they filled out questionnaires. At least 70% of all children agreed to blood sampling and measurements of body composition and bone mineral measurements by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. The primary endpoints of the study after one year were an increase in total PA by accelerometry, an increase in aerobic fitness measured by the 20 m shuttle run, a decrease in percent body fat derived from skinfold measurements and an increase in quality of life as assessed by the child health questionnaire in the intervention group compared to the control group. Secondary outcomes were overall fitness, differences in body composition including body fat distribution, cardiovascular risk factors, psychosocial health, bone mineral content and density of femur, lumbar spine and total body and food intake.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7201" xml_f="7211" txt_i="2392" txt_f="2402">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7222" xml_f="7754" txt_i="2403" txt_f="2935">Our preliminary data suggest that the children were representative of Swiss children with respect to sex, socio-demographic status, and body mass index.

Publishing the design and rational of a RCT before the results are available has important benefits. The study can be critically evaluated for its methodological quality, irrespective of the results. If a design paper has been written, the results will most probably be published, even if the results are negative. A design paper includes a more detailed description of the study population, the intervention and all outcome measures than what can be reported in the method section of a regular publication focusing only on part of the study results. This paper will help researchers in the same field to compare the methods and the methodological qualities of future RCT and it provides detailed information for health professionals or educators to apply the intervention if the results show improvements in the outcome measures.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9766" xml_f="9778" txt_i="4777" txt_f="4789">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9789" xml_f="10028" txt_i="4790" txt_f="5029">The increase in sedentary behavior, i.e. physical inactivity, over the last decades is thought to be one of the main risk factors for the development of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and psychosocial constraints [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="10059" xml_f="10060" txt_i="5029" txt_f="5030">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10067" xml_f="10318" txt_i="5030" txt_f="5281">].

Furthermore, the school environment gives the opportunity to work on various areas before, during and after school to increase overall and/or total PA.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="16151" xml_f="16165" txt_i="9982" txt_f="9996">Methods/Design</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="16185" xml_f="16201" txt_i="9997" txt_f="10013">Study objectives</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16212" xml_f="16492" txt_i="10014" txt_f="10294">The aim of the proposed project was to evaluate in a RCT a school-based program if implementation of an extended PA program throughout the day during one school-year improved overall PA, physical fitness, physical health, and psychosocial well-being in 6- to 13-year-old children.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="16514" xml_f="16527" txt_i="10296" txt_f="10309">Main outcomes</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16538" xml_f="16596" txt_i="10310" txt_f="10368">Primary outcomes of the intervention study were defined as</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16603" xml_f="16657" txt_i="10369" txt_f="10423">1. an increase in total PA measured by accelerometers,</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16664" xml_f="16736" txt_i="10424" txt_f="10496">2. an increase in aerobic fitness measured by the 20 m shuttle run test,</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16743" xml_f="16799" txt_i="10497" txt_f="10553">3. a reduction of percent body fat measured by skinfolds</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16806" xml_f="16882" txt_i="10554" txt_f="10630">4. an increase in quality of life measured by the child health questionnaire</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16889" xml_f="16945" txt_i="10631" txt_f="10687">in the intervention group compared to the control group.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16952" xml_f="17554" txt_i="10688" txt_f="11290">Secondary outcomes of the intervention study were overall fitness (i.e. strength, speed, endurance, flexibility and coordination), body composition (including body fat distribution), cardiovascular risk factors (including blood pressure, blood lipids, glucose metabolism, C-reactive protein, adiponectin), bone health (including bone mineral content and density of femur, lumbar spine and total body as well as bone metabolism), psychosocial health (including social and stress coping, social anxiety, self esteem, drug abuse), and food intake.

A public school-based PA intervention offers a good opportunity to work with a large group of average children irrespective of their parents' behaviour and attitudes towards PA and health, and irrespective of their socioeconomic background.

The focus on PA alone with a negligible advice regarding television viewing and nutrition, which was also given to the control group, helps us to assess the impact of changes in PA by itself in these age groups on outcome measures like childhood obesity. In contrast to interventions focusing on nutrition or media use, changing PA is less directly linked to prohibition of activities and may thus be perceived as positive rather than negative.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47690" xml_f="49099" txt_i="38594" txt_f="40003">Our trial has some limitations. First, despite the randomization of intervention and control schools, the children, parents and classroom teachers knew the group allocation prior to baseline testing which could bias test results. This was unavoidable, as the time schedule and organization of the school year in the intervention groups had to be adapted several months before the school year started. Second, some of the investigators were not blinded to group assignment of the children because of the extensive need of manpower for testing and the financial restraints to recruit additional, blinded personnel. To assess some of the variables, we did not exclusively use validated measures. For example, we modified some of the questionnaires regarding PA or food intake to better adapt to our local situation and to broaden some of the information. Regarding PA, we will validate the questionnaires against the accelerometer measurements both before and after the intervention. Regarding the food questionnaire, we think that it is more informative to adapt them to the local use, especially as the gold standard, i.e. a 3–7 dietary recall protocol by itself has many shortcomings. PA has various effects on multiple determinants of health. We therefore defined several primary outcomes to be able to measure all important aspects related to an increased PA which we intended to induce by our intervention.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49106" xml_f="49530" txt_i="40004" txt_f="40428">We hypothesize that our intervention will lead to an increase in PA, fitness and overall health.
