The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is 70–80% and a significant proportion of people affected develop chronic low back pain (CLBP). Besides a severe negative impact on people’s health and health-related quality of life, CLBP is associated with substantial costs for society. Medical costs for the management of CLBP and costs for production losses due to absenteeism from work are sizeable. Pharmaceuticals, physical activity, manipulation, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions are examples of widely used treatments for CLBP. However, the scientific basis to recommend the use of one treatment over another is limited and more research is needed to study the effects, costs and cost-effectiveness of treatments for CLBP in clinical practice.</offsets></p><p id="Par2"><offsets xml_i="6854" xml_f="7255" txt_i="886" txt_f="1287">The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness (back pain-related functional limitation, back pain intensity, general health, health-related quality of life, and working status), costs (medical costs and costs for production losses) and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic care and physiotherapy when added to information and advice in the treatment of patients with non-specific CLBP in Sweden.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7277" xml_f="7291" txt_i="1289" txt_f="1303">Methods/design</offsets></title><p id="Par3"><offsets xml_i="7312" xml_f="8236" txt_i="1304" txt_f="2228">This is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, where participants are recruited through six primary care rehabilitation units (PCRUs) in Stockholm County Council, Sweden. Individuals with non-specific CLBP are individually randomised to one of four treatment groups: ‘information and advice’; ‘physiotherapy, and information and advice’; ‘chiropractic care, and information and advice’; or ‘chiropractic care, physiotherapy, and information and advice’. A sample size of 600 participants will be recruited during a period of 33 months. A computer-based questionnaire is used to collect data on back pain-related functional limitation (Oswestry Disability Index), pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale), general health (self-rated health), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), and working status (measured as percentage of full-time work). Data will be collected at baseline, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after baseline.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8258" xml_f="8268" txt_i="2230" txt_f="2240">Discussion</offsets></title><p id="Par4"><offsets xml_i="8289" xml_f="8444" txt_i="2241" txt_f="2396">The results from our study should be considered when producing evidence-based guidelines and recommendations on which treatment strategies to use for CLBP.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8466" xml_f="8484" txt_i="2398" txt_f="2416">Trial registration</offsets></title><p id="Par5"><offsets xml_i="8505" xml_f="8526" txt_i="2417" txt_f="2438">ISRCTN registry, ID: </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN15830360"><offsets xml_i="8608" xml_f="8622" txt_i="2438" txt_f="2452">ISRCTN15830360</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="8633" xml_f="8679" txt_i="2452" txt_f="2498">.

An expectation bias may work in both directions depending on whether patient expectations and beliefs are positive (placebo effect) or negative (nocebo effect). We have not included any questions to measure patient expectations and beliefs before the treatment starts, which implies that we cannot estimate the potential expectation bias. On the other hand, which is a strength of the study, the results from our pragmatic RCT will reflect real effects for patients with CLBP in a primary care setting. Some patients do not always feel that they will get the treatment they would prefer, which may also affect the outcome of the treatment in clinical practice. Another limitation is the follow-up period in the trial, which is 1 year. Ideally, we would like to have a 2-year follow-up to be able to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic care and physiotherapy in the long run.</offsets></p><p id="Par63"><offsets xml_i="55181" xml_f="55789" txt_i="42091" txt_f="42699">CLBP is a severe public health problem associated with substantial costs for society.
