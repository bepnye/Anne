Measures included daily parental ATS reports (optionally by SMS) and child ATS reports, as well as accelerometry (ActiGraph GT3X+). At baseline, all children were asked to wear the accelerometer for the same week; in the post-randomisation phase, small subsamples were monitored each week. In the 2 weeks when a child wore the accelerometer, parents also reported the start and finish times of the journey to school. The intervention consisted of a lottery-based incentive scheme; every ATS day reported by the parent, whether by paper or SMS, corresponded to one ticket entered into a weekly £5 voucher draw. Before each draw session, the researcher prepared the tickets and placed them into an opaque bag, from which one was randomly picked by the teacher at the draw session.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5861" xml_f="5868" txt_i="1267" txt_f="1274">Results</offsets></title><p id="Par3"><offsets xml_i="5889" xml_f="5928" txt_i="1275" txt_f="1314">Four schools replied positively (3.3%, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5936" xml_f="5937" txt_i="1314" txt_f="1315">N</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5946" xml_f="6025" txt_i="1315" txt_f="1394"> = 123) and 29 participants were recruited in the two schools selected (33.0%, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="6033" xml_f="6034" txt_i="1394" txt_f="1395">N</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="6043" xml_f="6351" txt_i="1395" txt_f="1703"> = 88).

Interrater agreement between parental and child reports was assessed, as well as the validity of parental and child report compared to accelerometry on the premise that trips reported as being active (ATS trips) would show higher MVPA than trips reported as non-active (non-ATS trips). If shown to be valid, the sole use of ATS reports could be an option for an evaluation trial considering the high costs of accelerometers, or even the preference for child reports over those by their parents who may be less available to participate in research. The paper parental ATS report form was collected weekly during the pilot trial and had five questions, each with the same format, one for each school day of the week: “On day X, did your child walk or cycle to school, all or part of the journey?”; parents were requested to tick a box (YES or NO) for each question, each day as the week went by. Once completed, the parental ATS report was returned to the classroom by the child on the designated day when the researcher visited the school (same day each week). Optionally, parents could report ATS in real time by SMS, in which case they received a text message each morning with the same question as above and were asked to reply ‘YES’ or ‘NO’.</offsets></p><p id="Par15"><offsets xml_i="15742" xml_f="16220" txt_i="8998" txt_f="9476">The questions and format of the child ATS report were similar to that of the parental report.

The same rule applied to parental SMS reports. When there was a mix of YES and NO’s reported within the same week, missing responses were treated as true missing data. The baseline week was the only week where we did not apply the implied response rule, meaning that any blank days on the ATS forms were always treated as true missing data irrespective of what had been reported on the other days that week. This was felt to be an appropriate decision because of an issue with the paper report response format at baseline, which requested participants to circle ‘YES’ or ‘NO’, with ‘YES/NO’ being placed after each of the report questions. This seemed to have contributed to an unusually large number of blank forms, as in the next weeks, the circling format was replaced by a ‘tick the box’ format in which two boxes (one for ‘yes’ and one for ‘no’) were placed below each of the report questions and no more blank forms were returned. On child ATS reports, the response format was also changed after the baseline week in the interests of consistency and clarity although no blank reports had been returned at baseline, probably because the researcher clarified that each question needed responding, when children completed it in the classroom.</offsets></p><p id="Par38"><offsets xml_i="39160" xml_f="39525" txt_i="28599" txt_f="28964">In total, across both schools, parental ATS reports provided valid data relating to 979 days (of which 2.8% were implied); there were 261 days with missing data (21.0%), mainly from the control school (183/261).

On average (median, IQR) and equally in both schools, the trip to school lasted 10 min (LQ 6–UQ 15), the duration of accelerometer wear during the times specified by the parents was 10 min (LQ 7–UQ 15) and the percentage of time that the child wore the accelerometer during these times was 100% (LQ 100–UQ 100).

The fact that data collection happened during morning play time in the control school, and not during classroom hours as in the intervention school, could also have had a negative impact as control children could have been less eager to spend part of their break in the classroom.

The MVPA difference found between ATS and non-ATS trips during timeframe (1.6 to 1.7 min) was small considering the average duration (10 min) and distance (0.5 miles) of the commute to school in our study (in other words, a child walking all the way to school would be expected to exhibit considerably higher levels of MVPA in a 10-min walk). This could be due to a misreport of the actual times of the journey which would have resulted in physical activity being assessed at the wrong times, as well as to a misreport of travel mode (i.e. non-ATS trips reported as ATS or vice-versa, or part-ATS trips being reported as non-ATS). Still, when using a wider and fixed timeframe—the hour before school—we found a 2.4-min MVPA difference between ATS and non-ATS trips in our study which is below that usually reported in studies with similar measurement procedures, e.g. 5.6 min [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36"><offsets xml_i="55796" xml_f="55798" txt_i="42714" txt_f="42716">36</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="55805" xml_f="56174" txt_i="42716" txt_f="43085">]. A possible explanation for this discrepancy, besides the misreport of travel mode, is the encouragement of ‘park and stride’ trips in the intervention school, from which most accelerometer data was obtained. These partway active trips were allowed entry into the weekly draws, possibly resulting in large spreads of MVPA values for trips of identical duration (Fig. </offsets><xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig"><offsets xml_i="56206" xml_f="56207" txt_i="43085" txt_f="43086">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="56214" xml_f="56216" txt_i="43086" txt_f="43088">).</offsets></p><p id="Par54"><offsets xml_i="56234" xml_f="56753" txt_i="43089" txt_f="43608">Based on the above findings, we recommend using a wider and fixed timeframe to detect MVPA differences between ATS and non-ATS trips, as opposed to reported journey times. Although problems exist with both timeframes, the difference between ATS and non-ATS trips found in the hour before school (2.4 min) is likely to be nearer to what would be expected of a 10-min walk than the MVPA difference observed here in the parent-reported times of the journey (1.6–1.7 min). This is supported by a study conducted in the UK (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="56761" xml_f="56762" txt_i="43608" txt_f="43609">n</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="56771" xml_f="56926" txt_i="43609" txt_f="43764"> = 141, age 11–12) which combined a Global Positioning System (GPS) with accelerometry and found that approximately half of the journey was spent on MVPA [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37"><offsets xml_i="56959" xml_f="56961" txt_i="43764" txt_f="43766">37</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="56968" xml_f="57201" txt_i="43766" txt_f="43999">]. More precisely, the average duration of the trip to school in that study was 20.3 min and children who walked to school accumulated on average 10.5 of MVPA during the journey to school, which was also true for the afternoon trip [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37"><offsets xml_i="57234" xml_f="57236" txt_i="43999" txt_f="44001">37</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="57243" xml_f="57711" txt_i="44001" txt_f="44469">]. In the same study, children who walked to school also accumulated on average 14.5 min of MVPA in the hour before classes. By the same token, we would expect to obtain 5 min of MVPA during ATS trips because the average trip duration in our study was 10 min and some extra MVPA time in the hour before the classes, which was not the case. Unlike Sowthward et al., we assessed trips and their duration by report and are unable to distinguish uni- and multi-mode trips.</offsets></p><p id="Par55"><offsets xml_i="57729" xml_f="58528" txt_i="44470" txt_f="45269">At the request of the editor of this journal, we conducted a post hoc analysis of the estimated effect size of the intervention on four possible outcomes: minutes of MVPA during the hour before school, percentage of MVPA during the hour before school, number of ATS days reported by the parent out of the 40 post-baseline days and number of ATS days reported by the child out of the 40 post-baseline days. None of the four regression models yielded statistically significant results but, to our surprise, three of them suggested a decrease of the outcome in the intervention. Only one of the models—the one where the outcome was the number of ATS days reported by the parent—suggested an increase in the intervention school, and this was the model with the smallest number of participants included (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="58536" xml_f="58537" txt_i="45269" txt_f="45270">n</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="58546" xml_f="58801" txt_i="45270" txt_f="45525"> = 17). It is difficult to interpret these results. We believe that a larger sample size is needed to assess the effects of the intervention on any of the four outcomes and recommend caution in the interpretation of our intervention effect size estimates.</offsets></p><p id="Par56"><offsets xml_i="58819" xml_f="59631" txt_i="45526" txt_f="46338">Our study had a number of limitations. The sample size was small and, in keeping with the pilot nature, meant that it was not adequately powered for an analysis of effectiveness. Study participants were predominantly White British, from a relatively deprived area (both schools were in the fourth IMD quintile), making it difficult to generalise findings to other populations. However, we were able to successfully engage with participants in these areas, which is often challenging. Although an objective measure of physical activity, accelerometry does not provide the contextual information necessary for an exclusive focus on ATS behaviour and the resort to reported measures is needed. Due to limited resources, only one researcher (PhD student) was involved in the delivery of procedures and data analysis.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title><offsets xml_i="59664" xml_f="59674" txt_i="46340" txt_f="46350">Conclusion</offsets></title><p id="Par57"><offsets xml_i="59696" xml_f="61095" txt_i="46351" txt_f="47750">In conclusion, an ATS incentive scheme with an approximate duration of 3 months seems feasible for those participants who took part. However, a different recruitment strategy, especially at the school level, is necessary and should be further investigated. Most materials were returned by participants, but parental ATS reports by SMS, rather than on paper, may be a better option. Selecting a wider and fixed timeframe for analysis of the journey to school (e.g. hour before the classes) may allow a more accurate detection of MVPA differences between ATS and non-ATS trips. Both parent and child ATS reports appear to be valid against accelerometry, but further validation work must be undertaken if the aim is to identify clearer differences between active and non-active trips to school. The high levels of ATS reported by parents and children suggest that an evaluation trial may benefit from targeting schools and children where the scope for ATS promotion is greater, based on updated and accurate data. Family circumstances, local environment and infrastructure and school policies may act as confounding factors, mediators and moderators, and data need to be collected in a consistent manner on these variables. How family background, receipt of an intervention and school involvement affect feasibility outcomes should be further explored; for this purpose, a ‘realist trial’ perspective [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38"><offsets xml_i="61128" xml_f="61130" txt_i="47750" txt_f="47752">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="61137" xml_f="61158" txt_i="47752" txt_f="47773">] may be appropriate.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="61214" xml_f="61230" txt_i="47775" txt_f="47791">Additional files</offsets></title><sec id="Sec20"><p><offsets xml_i="61257" xml_f="61258" txt_i="47792" txt_f="47793">
