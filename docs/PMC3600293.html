Yoga is specifically characterized to achieve mental, emotional, and physical effects. Medical yoga has been designed to suit people who are severely ill but who can practise yoga without the risk of worsening their condition. A yoga class consists of a number of positions, movements, breathing techniques, mantras, and meditation. The starting position can be sitting, lying, or standing, and the movements are generally slower than in traditional forms of yoga.

It is also possible that the patients in the control group, as they were aware of being studied, became more observant on their symptoms and well-being and thereby viewed their pain in a new light. The overall extent of individual training was not registered in this study. The patients were not specifically asked to practice the exercises at home between the training occasions and this may be another reason for the lack of significant differences regarding pain between the groups in the present study.

However, generalization of the result could be difficult because of the patients' wide range of overlapping symptoms. There was an uneven distribution between men and women in this study, which could be regarded as a limitation for the external validity of the findings. Unfortunately, no stratified randomization for gender was performed. The skewed distribution is nevertheless similar to the distribution of patients seeking medical care for stress-related symptoms in primary health care. On the other hand, Strömberg et al. have shown that the psychosocial stressors, such as feeling very stressed, perceiving poor health, and being dissatisfied with the family situation, are equally associated with depression in men and women [</offsets><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="33097" xml_f="33099" txt_i="25868" txt_f="25870">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33106" xml_f="33109" txt_i="25870" txt_f="25873">]. </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33116" xml_f="34596" txt_i="25874" txt_f="27354">The physiotherapist who carried out the assessments was not blind to the participant's group allocation, but since the patients filled in the questionnaire themselves, this was considered acceptable. Furthermore, she was not involved in the yoga intervention. The use of self-rated questionnaires and the fact that the patients were nonblinded to the intervention could be regarded as limitations in this study design. In order to reduce the so-called “Hawthorne effect” (improvement or modification of an aspect simply in response to the fact that the patients know they are being studied), we calculated and compared the mean change from baseline to the end of the study between the groups. However, it is still possible that there is a placebo effect in the yoga group, depending on positive expectations from the patients. An intervention such as the one described is not possible to exactly find out what part of the intervention that had an effect: the yoga, the scheduled activity, or the belonging to a group with others suffering from the same condition. Methodologically, it would have been most appealing to evaluate medical yoga compared to an entirely untreated control group. Due to ethical reasons, the participants in both groups maintained their usual care during the study period. Although, this can be regarded as a study limitation, it would not be ethically acceptable to withdrawthe usual care in order todecrease possible confounders for the study results. </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34603" xml_f="35406" txt_i="27355" txt_f="28158">The outcome measures in the present study were primarily Swedish versions of well-known questionnaires for the measurement of stress-related symptoms such as general stress, burnout, and sleeping disturbances.
