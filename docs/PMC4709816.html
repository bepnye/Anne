It appears that the level of education and knowledge is so much higher than the general population. It is recommended that in future studies samples should be chosen from various groups of people such as rural ones to obtain more generalizable results.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title><offsets xml_i="44190" xml_f="44191" txt_i="29186" txt_f="29187">C</offsets><sc><offsets xml_i="44195" xml_f="44204" txt_i="29187" txt_f="29196">ONCLUSION</offsets></sc></title><p><offsets xml_i="44220" xml_f="44848" txt_i="29197" txt_f="29825">Our findings showed that the health education programs designed based on HBM could positively affect the prostate cancer preventive behaviors of our retired participants by improving their knowledge level and HBM components. Hence, we could confirm the efficacy of HBM in adopting the prostate cancer screening behaviors by the participants. Since this type of cancer is treatable in early stages, more attention should be paid to the educational design and planning based on educational theories and models so that we could increase the required knowledge about prostate cancer for early diagnosis and treatment of the disease.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGEMENT</sc></title><p>The present article was extracted from the thesis written by Ms. Maryam Zare and financially supported by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Grants no 6721).
