The Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) is a licensed intensive home-visiting intervention developed in the USA and introduced into practice in England that involves up to 64 structured home visits from early pregnancy until the child's second birthday by specially recruited and trained family nurses. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of giving the programme to teenage first-time mothers on infant and maternal outcomes up to 24 months after birth.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8074" xml_f="8081" txt_i="641" txt_f="648">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8092" xml_f="8690" txt_i="649" txt_f="1244">We did a pragmatic, non-blinded, randomised controlled, parallel-group trial in community midwifery settings at 18 partnerships between local authorities and primary and secondary care organisations in England.

Because intellectual property is owned by the University of Colorado, all previous trials were restricted to the three US evaluations (in Elmira [NY], Memphis [TN], and Denver [CO]). As is commonly found in home-visiting evaluations, each trial in the USA identified multiple outcomes and was not formally adjusted for multiple significance testing. The trials reported positive effects in prenatal health behaviours, birth outcomes, sensitive child care, child and adolescent functioning, and maternal lifecourse. Two outcomes with prior replicated positive effects by 24 months post-partum are changes in smoking and second pregnancy. In Elmira, the intervention reduced cigarettes smoked by four, and in Denver a reduction in cotinine was reported in mothers who received the intervention.

Rather, our trial provides data for the intervention as adapted for implementation in a UK setting and delivered in a substantially different publicly funded and configured health-care system. We show that adding the Family Nurse Partnership programme to usual care provided no additional short-term benefit for our selected primary outcomes (smoking in pregnancy, birthweight, emergency hospital attendance and admission for the child, and subsequent pregnancy). The study findings are the most directly applicable to practice and setting in the UK, where the programme is now provided in England under the operating framework for the NHS to about 16 000 concurrent women in parallel and subsequent to the trial period. The lack of benefit evidenced for changes in smoking during pregnancy and second pregnancies therefore limits the degree to which programme benefits shown elsewhere can be assumed in different health-care settings and to different service populations, even when objective programme fidelity from US trials was maintained.</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="14833" xml_f="14875" txt_i="6689" txt_f="6731">Implications of all the available evidence</offsets></bold></p><p><offsets xml_i="14889" xml_f="15630" txt_i="6732" txt_f="7473">Continued provision of the Family Nurse Partnership programme cannot be supported on the basis of the trial evidence found for its effectiveness in the UK setting. Subsequent changes to the intervention itself, to usually provided care, or to the population targeted would justify re-examination. Similarly, any positive benefits observed through longer-term follow-up of the current trial cohort might shift the evidentiary balance in favour of the intervention and warrants continued evaluation of the trial cohort.

Obstetric antenatal care, child surveillance, and access to emergency medicine were provided for usual care group participants in the US trials of NFP; however, in this UK-based trial, the extent of care provision accessible to the usual care group might have diluted any effect of FNP. Although our data do not quantify duration of health-care contact episodes, the overall rate of reported community midwifery contact was similar between groups. Women assigned to usual care saw health visitors eight more times than did those in the FNP group, but women assigned to FNP had had an average of 39 specialist nurse visits, each lasting on average longer than 1 h. Therefore, it is not likely that an equivalent level of health care was provided to women in the usual care group and that can itself explain a reduction in level of intervention effect.

Other primary outcomes, including birthweight, were also recommended by the meeting of an advisory committee to the funders as part of the development of the commissioning brief and included input from the representatives of the programme. Therefore, we included birthweight as a policy-relevant and readily measurable outcome that was applicable to all trial participants. It is identified as an outcome addressed by the programme (eg, on the current FNP website), although we would recognise that only the Elmira efficacy study has shown differences for the subgroup of younger women (as summarised in the logic model). We selected all emergency episodes as a primary outcome because we were confident that it could be reliably ascertained (ie, episodes of care more likely to be recorded than not, whereas reason for visit less accurately recorded), although episodes for injuries and ingestions were included as key secondary outcomes. An episode rate for all attendances can include both addressable and non-addressable reasons, hence the importance of the outcomes that focus on injury and ingestions alone. Events specific to injuries and ingestions therefore represent outcomes of most relevance to FNP, and clearer markers of programme impact. Focusing on injury and ingestion episodes alone in primary care, attendance of accident and emergency department, and hospital admission still did not show any group difference. Although length of stay has also been taken as an indicator of maltreatment, differences might exist between health-care settings in the UK and the USA that affects its interpretation. Length of stay is dependent not only on injury severity but also time and day of attendance, management required, and the availability of appropriate senior staff including anaesthetists to do relevant investigations. These considerations might distance length of stay from factors such as amounts of supervision, causative factors, or intent to injure. Although this was not recommended at commissioning, nor included as a trial outcome, it can be further explored in secondary analyses. Transparent reporting in this paper of all a-priori outcomes allows for further assessment of the relative benefits of the programme by policy makers and service commissioners.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46681" xml_f="47071" txt_i="35231" txt_f="35621">In conclusion, we show substantial additional cost, no benefit for policy relevant main outcomes, and some advantage for a few secondary outcomes for mother and child when adding FNP to existing health service provision in England.
