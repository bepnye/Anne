Random allocation is a technique that chooses individuals for treatment groups and control groups entirely by chance with no regard to the will of researchers or patients' condition and preference. This allows researchers to control all known and unknown factors that may affect results in treatment groups and control groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="3850" xml_f="4246" txt_i="716" txt_f="1112">Allocation concealment is a technique used to prevent selection bias by concealing the allocation sequence from those assigning participants to intervention groups, until the moment of assignment. Allocation concealment prevents researchers from influencing which participants are assigned to a given intervention group. This process must be included in the experiment for the success of any RCT.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="4253" xml_f="4623" txt_i="1113" txt_f="1483">Blinding refers to keeping trial participants, health care providers, assessors or data collectors unaware of the assigned intervention, so that they will not be influenced by that knowledge. This process is conducted to minimize possible bias in implementation, dropouts, measurements, etc. Blinding is not always feasible for RCT but should be implemented if possible.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="4630" xml_f="4745" txt_i="1484" txt_f="1599">Randomization, allocation concealment and blinding should be well implemented and should be described in the paper.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="4752" xml_f="5156" txt_i="1600" txt_f="2004">On the other hand, many researchers are still unfamiliar with how to do randomization, and it has been shown that there are problems in many studies with the accurate performance of the randomization and that some studies are reporting incorrect results. So, we will introduce the recommended way of using statistical methods for a randomized controlled study and show how to report the results properly.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5172" xml_f="5199" txt_i="2005" txt_f="2032">CATEGORIES OF RANDOMIZATION</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5219" xml_f="5239" txt_i="2033" txt_f="2053">Simple Randomization</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5250" xml_f="5650" txt_i="2054" txt_f="2454">The easiest method is simple randomization. If you assign subjects into two groups A and B, you assign subjects to each group purely randomly for every assignment. Even though this is the most basic way, if the total number of samples is small, sample numbers are likely to be assigned unequally. For this reason, we recommend you to use this method when the total number of samples is more than 100.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5672" xml_f="5691" txt_i="2456" txt_f="2475">Block Randomization</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5702" xml_f="5792" txt_i="2476" txt_f="2566">We can create a block to assign sample numbers equally to each group and assign the block.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5799" xml_f="6124" txt_i="2567" txt_f="2892">If we specify two in one block (the so-called block size is two), we can make two possible sequences of AB and BA. When we randomize them, the same sample numbers can be assigned to each group. If the block size is four, we can make six possible sequences; these are AABB, ABAB, ABBA, BAAB, BABA, BBAA, and we randomize them.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6131" xml_f="6590" txt_i="2893" txt_f="3352">However, there is a disadvantage in that the executer can predict the next assignment. We can easily know the fact that B comes after A if the block size is two and if the block size is four; we can predict what every 4th sample is. This is discordant with the principle of randomization. To solve this problem, the allocator must hide the block size from the executer and use randomly mixed block sizes. For example, the block size can be two, four, and six.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6612" xml_f="6636" txt_i="3354" txt_f="3378">Stratified Randomization</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6647" xml_f="7059" txt_i="3379" txt_f="3791">Randomization is important because it is almost the only way to assign all the other variables equally except for the factor (A and B) in which we are interested. However, some very important confounding variables can often be assigned unequally to the two groups. This possibility increases when the number of samples is smaller, and we can stratify the variables and assign the two groups equally in this case.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7066" xml_f="7490" txt_i="3792" txt_f="4216">For example, if the smoking status is very important, what will you do? First, we have two methods of randomization that we learned previously. There are two randomly assigned separate sequences for smokers and non-smokers. Smokers are assigned to the smoker's sequences, and non-smokers are assigned to the non-smoker's sequences. Therefore, both smokers and non-smokers groups will be placed equally with the same numbers.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7497" xml_f="7806" txt_i="4217" txt_f="4526">So we can use 'simple randomization with/without stratification' or 'block randomization with/without stratification.' However, if there are multiple stratified variables, it is difficult to place samples in both groups equally with the same numbers. Usually two or fewer stratified variables are recommended.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7834" xml_f="7859" txt_i="4529" txt_f="4554">EXAMPLES OF RANDOMIZATION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7870" xml_f="7992" txt_i="4555" txt_f="4677">Although there are websites or common programs for randomization, let us use an Excel file.

The trial adhered to established procedures to maintain separation between staff that take outcome measurements and staff that deliver the intervention.
