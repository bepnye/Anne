Each study site obtained permission from their Human Studies Committee (or equivalent) prior to beginning the project.

Participating sites randomly reviewed 10% of their applicant pool or a minimum of 50 applications. Randomization was achieved by assigning each site a single-digit number. The site then reviewed all ERAS applications whose unique application identifiers ended with that number. If the number of applications at a given site did not meet the minimum of 50 applications, applications with unique identifiers ending with the next higher digit were reviewed. Additionally, each site had the opportunity to review other applications at their discretion without regard to randomization as long as they completed a minimum of 50 randomized reviews.
