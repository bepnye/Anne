Most of them appeared to be reluctant presumably because (i) many of them simply did not believe in homeopathy; (ii) many had taboo against giving blood which, they believed, would cause them further harm; and (iii) some researchers had earlier taken blood, urine, nail and hair samples from them promising them to give effective remedies, but never came back again with either the results or the promised remedy! after great perseverance, however, some villagers agreed to undertake a blind placebo-controlled study only for 1 month, but most others maintained that they would agree to sign the ‘informed consent’ form and give us their blood samples only if they were assured that they would be given the actual drug for a long time and not any ‘placebo’.
