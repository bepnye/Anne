Translating funding into better health requires many actions by a large number of people. The actions span from community to the national level. While different forms of PBIs are being implemented in a number of countries to improve health outcomes, there has not been a systematic review of the evidence of their impact on the health of mothers and newborns. This paper analyzes and synthesizes the available evidence from published studies on the impact of supply-side PBIs on the quantity and quality of health services for mothers and newborns. This paper reviews evidence from published and grey literature that spans PBI for public-sector facilities, PBI in social insurance reforms, and PBI in NGO contracting. Some initiatives focus on safe deliveries, and others reward a broader package of results that include deliveries. The Evidence Review Team that focused on supply-side incentives for the US Government Evidence Summit on Enhancing Provision and Use of Maternal Health Services through Financial Incentives, reviewed published research reports and papers and added studies from additional grey literature that were deemed relevant. After collecting and reviewing 17 documents, nine studies were included in this review, three of which used before-after designs; four included comparison or control groups; one applied econometric methods to a five-year time series; and one reported results from a large-scale impact evaluation with randomly-assigned intervention and control facilities. The available evidence suggests that incentives that reward providers for institutional deliveries result in an increase in the number of institutional deliveries. There is some evidence that the content of antenatal care can improve with PBI. We found no direct evidence on the impact of PBI on neonatal health services or on mortality of mothers and newborns, although intention of the study was not to document impact on mortality. A number of studies describe approaches to rewarding quality as well as increases in the quantities of services provided, although how quality is defined and monitored is not always clear. Because incentives exist in all health systems, considering how to align the incentives of the many health workers and their supervisors so that they focus efforts on achieving health goals for mothers and newborns is critical if the health system is to perform more effectively and efficiently. A wide range of PBI models is being developed and tested, and there is still much to learn about what works best. Future studies should include a larger focus on rewarding quality and measuring its impact. Finally, more qualitative research to better understand PBI implementation and how various incentive models function in different settings is needed to help practitioners refine and improve their programmes.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>Health systems strengthening</kwd><kwd>Pay for performance (P4P)</kwd><kwd>Performance-based financing (PBF)</kwd><kwd>Provider payment mechanisms</kwd><kwd>Results-based financing (RBF)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="sec1_1"><title><offsets xml_i="6625" xml_f="6637" txt_i="3089" txt_f="3101">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6648" xml_f="7072" txt_i="3102" txt_f="3526">Health financing strategies that incorporate performance-based incentives (PBIs) are being applied in many developing countries, often with improvements in the health of mothers and newborns as the central goal.

This paper focuses on the impact of PBI initiatives that pay providers (individuals and facilities) and their supervisors (at subnational levels of government) if they achieve predetermined performance measures of the health of mothers and newborns. It is based, in part, on lessons that emerged from the US Government Evidence Summit on Enhancing Provision and Use of Maternal Health Services through Financial Incentives, which took place in Washington, DC in April 2012. While evidence of the impact of PBI is not fully clear, this paper will argue that lack of evidence may be due to a dearth of quality studies rather than weak programmes or inadequate impact of PBI schemes. We present the available evidence and suggest options for enhancing the global evidence base.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8135" xml_f="8838" txt_i="4545" txt_f="5248">The imperative to reduce maternal mortality in the developing world has increased political and financial commitments and spurred momentum around Millennium Development Goal 5 (MDG 5), which calls for reduction by three-fourths the maternal mortality ratio and achieving universal access to reproductive health services between 1990 and 2015. In total, 287,000 women die each year from complications of childbirth, the vast majority of whom live in developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, women have a lifetime risk of maternal death of 1 in every 39 compared to 1 in every 3,800 in developed regions of the world—the largest difference between poor and the rich countries of any health indicator (</offsets><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8869" xml_f="8870" txt_i="5248" txt_f="5249">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8877" xml_f="9215" txt_i="5249" txt_f="5587">). Much good has been done but experience has shown that health systems continue to underprovide proven cost-effective interventions and fail to reach the poorest populations. PBI is a promising intervention that, by changing incentives for many people who together comprise a health system, may contribute to reducing maternal mortality.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9222" xml_f="10366" txt_i="5588" txt_f="6732">Ensuring maternal wellbeing and survival requires knowledge of and demand for services by women and multiple interactions with a functioning health system capable of delivering quality reproductive and specifically maternal health services. Individuals must know when to seek care and demand services; health workers must be motivated to deliver care of sufficient quality; and the institutions they work for must be encouraged and enabled to make the systemic changes required to achieve the health goals for mothers and newborns. While maternal mortality is partly caused by insufficient inputs, such as equipment, supplies, facilities, trained health workers, and a coordinated referral system, it is also driven by disincentives in the health system that can hinder delivery of interventions that improve the health of women and their babies. The choices providers and their supervisors make depend on what they have (that is, on inputs), what they know, and, critically, on what influences and motivates them. PBI initiatives aim to counteract dysfunctional incentives and drive changes that strengthen health systems and improve outcomes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10373" xml_f="11712" txt_i="6733" txt_f="8072">Translating funding into health outputs or outcomes requires many actions by a large number of people that span from the national to the community level, from officials in the national ministry of health to people who work on the supply chain for lifesaving commodities and to health workers and their supervisors at the district level and in communities. Each of these people encounters internal drivers and extrinsic incentives that are both financial and non-financial, and these incentives interact to induce behaviours that contribute to either good or bad health outcomes. In many challenging contexts, existing incentive environments do not sufficiently inspire and reward the amount and/or type of actions needed to achieve the desired results. At the service-delivery level, for example, salary structures that provide relatively low, fixed salaries that do not vary with performance may not spur providers to take the steps necessary to attract patients or proactively solve bottlenecks. This may also lead to low productivity, absenteeism, poor quality, or lack of innovation. District health supervisors may provide minimal support partly due to their low salaries and weak accountability structures, which may not motivate them to do all they can to assure that the population in their district has access to quality services.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11719" xml_f="12467" txt_i="8073" txt_f="8821">PBI aims to counteract weak incentives in health systems of many developing countries by providing rewards directly linked to actions that contribute to health outcomes. Supply-side incentives can be given to healthcare providers when they achieve performance targets (such as providing the final course of malaria prophylaxis to a specified percentage of pregnant women in a given region) or a unit fee for providing each unit of a prioritized service. In addition, performance-based incentives are sometimes provided to health managers at the district, provincial, and national levels, conditional on such things as uninterrupted supplies of lifesaving commodities and the quality of services delivered at the facilities they are responsible for.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12474" xml_f="13683" txt_i="8822" txt_f="10031">PBI is not only a financing strategy. It can also have a significant impact on health systems. For example, because PBI schemes pay for results, the success of schemes rests fundamentally on the ability to monitor and verify those results accurately. Monitoring and verification require the development of robust health information and management systems; so, incorporating the PBI concept, even into the programmes aimed at specific diseases, can reinforce efforts to improve the timeliness, credibility, and accuracy of national reporting and monitoring. PBI can enhance the effectiveness of human resources for health by stimulating innovation, enhancing motivation and team work, incentivizing service in remote locations, and improving retention. Arrangements in governance can be strengthened by holding facilities, district teams, and health committees accountable for results. By rewarding increases in the quality of services as well as incentivizing increases in quantities of priority services, PBI can strengthen service delivery. Some schemes provide examples of innovative solutions to the persistent challenge of assuring reliable supplies of lifesaving medicines at the service-delivery level.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13690" xml_f="13947" txt_i="10032" txt_f="10289">Supply-side PBI programmes have been introduced allover the world, supported by governments and their donor partners.

Poor quality and an associated low score could result in a considerable reduction in the fees a facility could earn while good quality could ensure that a facility earned close to all fees for the quantity. In comparison, control facilities received a quarterly budget transfer equivalent to the average amount the intervention facilities earned as performance bonuses. This model allowed the researchers to address the question of whether improved performance was due to additional funds or to the performance-based financing system that conditioned payment on results. Compared to controls, women living in the catchment areas served by intervention facilities had a significant 23% higher probability of delivering in a health facility than women living in the regions served by control facilities.

The majority of studies are of short duration, making it hard to conclude whether the positive impact on the number of institutional deliveries will be sustained over time. It is also possible that other services that depend more on patients’ actions, such as decisions to present for ANC or family planning counselling, take longer time to show results and that studies of longer duration might show impact on these services (</offsets><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="38031" xml_f="38032" txt_i="29035" txt_f="29036">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38039" xml_f="38041" txt_i="29036" txt_f="29038">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38048" xml_f="39308" txt_i="29039" txt_f="30299">However, while few studies of the impact of supply-side PBI on healthcare utilization or outcomes are structured as randomized controlled trials, we question whether this standard should be applied to the evaluation of a system changing initiatives, such as PBI. When PBI is implemented on the supply side, a number of systemic changes are introduced, along with the opportunity for providers and subnational levels of government managers, individually or in teams, to earn payments linked to performance in addition to their salary. These changes may include: clearly-defined expectations of strong performance, sometimes with targets for reaching some proportion of the population with priority services; clearly-defined reporting relationships from facilities to district teams; incentives at multiple levels that complement and strengthen the system; strengthened information systems; and stronger accountability at various levels. Implementing PBI is a package of system-wide interventions, and it is usually not possible to separate the impact, for example, of the additional money being received by the providers from the clarity and accountability for performance that comes from establishing metrics and holding people accountable for achieving these.</offsets></p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="39356" xml_f="39364" txt_i="30300" txt_f="30308">Table 2.</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="39384" xml_f="39440" txt_i="30308" txt_f="30364">Snapshot of delivery, ANC and quality metrics and impact</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="39559" xml_f="39566" txt_i="30365" txt_f="30372">Country</offsets></td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="39628" xml_f="39638" txt_i="30373" txt_f="30383">Deliveries</offsets></td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="39700" xml_f="39703" txt_i="30384" txt_f="30387">ANC</offsets></td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="39765" xml_f="39772" txt_i="30388" txt_f="30395">Quality</offsets></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="39855" xml_f="39870" txt_i="30396" txt_f="30411">Afghanistan (9)</offsets></td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="39929" xml_f="39930" txt_i="30412" txt_f="30413">

Process documentation is a complement to reporting on quantitative evaluations since impact evaluations published in peer-reviewed journals typically do not provide insight into the ‘how’ and ‘why's of the observed changes because of the word-limits imposed by such journals (</offsets><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="50539" xml_f="50540" txt_i="36525" txt_f="36526">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="50547" xml_f="51042" txt_i="36526" txt_f="37021">). The studies reviewed here include only limited information on how incentivized performance measures are generated, including specific data sources and support to improve data-collection processes.

For PBI to support quality measures effectively, there is a need for metrics of quality that can be routinely measured, reported and verified by a third party. In most settings, these potential measures are not included in country-specific health management information systems. For example, the use of a uterotonic in the third stage of labour and the use of magnesium sulphate to address pre-eclampsia/eclampsia are measureable indicators that are not often tracked. In addition to content of care indicators, there is an opportunity to learn from experiences in developed countries that are holding providers accountable by reducing or refusing reimbursement for avoidable hospital re-admissions.</offsets></p><sec id="sec1_4_1"><title><offsets xml_i="53157" xml_f="53168" txt_i="38861" txt_f="38872">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="53179" xml_f="53889" txt_i="38873" txt_f="39583">A limitation of this paper and the presented evidence is that it draws narrowly from published literature that focuses on supply-side PBI for maternal and neonatal health and neglects the wider literature on supply-side PBI applied to other health services. In addition, this paper neglects the extensive literature on the effects of payment mechanisms on providers’ behaviour that is also directly relevant to understanding whether PBI can contribute to improving maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The paper on insurance in this series discusses the impact of paying providers a fee for each service on the caesarean section rate, especially when fees are considerably higher than for normal deliveries (</offsets><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="53921" xml_f="53923" txt_i="39583" txt_f="39585">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="53930" xml_f="53932" txt_i="39585" txt_f="39587">).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec1_4_2"><title><offsets xml_i="53968" xml_f="53979" txt_i="39589" txt_f="39600">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="53990" xml_f="54904" txt_i="39601" txt_f="40515">Supply-side performance-based incentives—incentives to healthcare providers and managers at all levels—are being tried in many different ways in developing countries allover the globe. They are being incorporated into national public health delivery systems; social insurance schemes; contracts with service-delivery NGOs in fragile states; and the way providers are reimbursed in schemes that target safe deliveries. The majority of studies show that supply-side performance-based incentives are associated with increased numbers of institutional deliveries. However, their impact on other maternal and neonatal health services is inconclusive, although there is some evidence of impact on the content of ANC care. Moreover, while the numbers of institutional deliveries may have increased in PBI programmes, the impact on health outcomes is not clear, particularly on maternal and infant morbidity and mortality.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="54911" xml_f="55735" txt_i="40516" txt_f="41340">Because incentives exist in all health systems, considering how to align the incentives of the many health workers and their supervisors so that they focus efforts on achieving maternal and neonatal health goals makes intuitive sense. There are a wide range of models being developed and tested and still much remains to be learnt about what works best. More research is needed to help governments, donors, implementers, and others assess the cost-benefit of PBI's impact on maternal and child health relative to other approaches aimed at improving maternal and child health; more robust and rigorous quantitative studies are needed before firm conclusions about PBI's effectiveness can be drawn. Finally, more qualitative work on programme implementation is needed to help practitioners refine and improve their programmes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="55742" xml_f="56614" txt_i="41341" txt_f="42213">In addition to understanding the impact of PBIs on health outcomes, there is a need to consider the impact of PBI on the functioning of health systems. For example, does the implementation of a programme that rewards for verified measures of performance enhance the quality and the use of information for decision-making, resulting in a stronger health information system? Does implementation of PBIs increase the productivity and effectiveness of human resources for health? Does the focus on rewarding results enable citizens to hold their health systems accountable? Does the opportunity to earn performance-based payments for enhanced use of health services provide the motivation and the funds needed to address shortages of essential medicines? Does the enhanced accountability for results strengthen supervision and arrangements in governance in the health systems?</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="56621" xml_f="56771" txt_i="42214" txt_f="42364">Understanding how PBI initiatives introduce systemic changes into health systems is a potentially valuable addition to the agenda for future research.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Musgrove</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><source>Financial and other rewards for good performance or results: a guided tour of concepts and terms and a short glossary</source><year>2011</year><publisher-loc>Washington, DC</publisher-loc><publisher-name>World Bank</publisher-name><fpage>12</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Beith</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Eichler</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><source>Performance-based incentives for maternal health: taking stock of current programs and future potentials</source><year>2011</year><publisher-loc>Bethesda, MD</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Health Systems 20/20, Abt Associates Inc.</publisher-name><fpage>51</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Witter</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fretheim</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kessy</surname><given-names>FL</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindahl</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Paying for performance to improve the delivery of health interventions in low- and middle-income countries</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source><year>2012</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>CD007899</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22336833</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Higgs</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name><name><surname>Stammer</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Balster</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evidence acquisition and evaluation for evidence summit on enhancing provision and use of maternal health services through financial incentives</article-title><source>J Health Popul Nutr</source><year>2013</year><volume>31</volume><issue>Suppl 2</issue><fpage>23</fpage><lpage>35</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rahman</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Rob</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Mahmud</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Alim</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hena</surname><given-names>IA</given-names></name><name><surname>Talukder</surname><given-names>MN</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group>
