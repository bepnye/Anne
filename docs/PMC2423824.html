We aimed to assess the aforementioned issues analyzing prospectively our experience from 1976 through Dec.92.</offsets></p><offsets xml_i="2906" xml_f="2907" txt_i="398" txt_f="399">

Duct stones were the indication in 94, Sphincter of oddi (SO) dysfunction in 23 and obstructive pancreatitis nodule in 8. Peroperative liver biopsies were obtained in 44 patients. The “follow-up” schedule (&gt; 2.5 years in 110) included clinical interview and LFT's on an yearly basis. Ultra sound (USG) was obtained every one or two years. ERC was done in 10 symptomatic patients and in 25 others for protocul purposes. Liver
biopsies were taken four to nine years post surgery in 11 patients-five at relaparotomy for non-biliary causes and six percutaneously by fine needle. Ductal mucosa biopsy could safely be performed in one patient 10 years after surgery.

A widely patent anastomosis of approximately 20 mms without mucosal inflammatory changes was documented in every patient assessed via ERC. food “debris” was detected within the distal duct of four patients yet it was easily flushed through the stoma. Normal tissue patterns were observed in all long-term liver biopsies.
