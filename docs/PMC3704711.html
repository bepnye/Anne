The hospital has a locally-developed electronic prescribing system known as PICS (Prescribing, Information and Communication System), which is used across all (approximately 1200) inpatient beds. The system covers all general and specialist medical and surgical wards. There are no inpatient beds for obstetrics, paediatrics, or mental health. PICS has a comprehensive audit database of administrative, prescribing and drug administration transactions within the system, including messages displayed to users and actions taken in response. Within PICS, the prescription warnings generated are hierarchically classified according to a decreasing level of seriousness: (1) disallow warning (this is a ‘hard stop’ warning with the associated on-screen text ‘prohibited action – unable to proceed’); (2) password warning (this is an interruptive warning with on-screen advice requiring the user to provide their password in order to proceed with the action); (3) tick box warning (this in a non-interruptive warning requiring acknowledgement by clicking onto a tick box); and (4) warning to consider additional safety information (this warning provides information with the associated on-screen text ‘no further action required’).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11992" xml_f="13504" txt_i="7277" txt_f="8789">The system also alerts prescribers to the presence of abnormal laboratory values. When abnormal laboratory values are received into the system, pop-up alerts are generated which are visible to junior doctors logged into the system in the relevant specialty. In case of seriously abnormal laboratory results, interruptive alarms are generated. When responding to alerts or alarms, doctors can either click a button on the electronic system to “accept” the message (and thus show explicitly that they have acknowledged the clinical implications of the decision to proceed), or click a button to “ignore” the message. Junior doctors are explicitly told that unless there are good reasons all warnings should be considered carefully and acknowledged where action needs to be taken. We are using acceptance rates as a surrogate for responsible action. However, it is possible that junior doctors would ignore warnings on the system, yet still take appropriate clinical action. This cannot be controlled for within this type of research. While it is possible that junior doctors will ‘accept’ a warning to move past it, rather than click the ‘ignore’ button, this is less likely to happen because all individual actions are logged on the system and stored, and thus capable of being traced back to an individual. Accepting an alert without considering the clinical implication constitutes a violation against good medical practice which carries serious sanctions which in turn is likely to deter doctors from doing so.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13511" xml_f="14257" txt_i="8790" txt_f="9536">Junior doctors below the specialty trainee level 3 (within about four years of graduation and equivalent to junior residents) who had used PICS for four months preceding the trial, and who would be using the system during the trial period were eligible for inclusion. We excluded doctors who had issued fewer than 10 prescriptions in the previous four months, and those who had only recently joined the hospital and for whom no baseline data were available. Given that we were randomising a specific cohort of junior doctors, the maximum sample size and trial duration were fixed. For this reason, a sample size calculation was not carried out initially.

One hundred and thirty nine doctors were excluded as it later transpired that their employment records had not been updated and they were above level 3 training. Data from junior doctors in their first year after graduation Foundation Year 1 (FY1) were analysed separately, because we hypothesized a priori that due to their limited clinical experience they would behave differently to those doctors with greater clinical experience and therefore show greater effects.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="15167" xml_f="15197" txt_i="10420" txt_f="10450">Ethics and research governance</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="15208" xml_f="15553" txt_i="10451" txt_f="10796">A favourable ethical opinion was given by the NHS East Midlands Nottingham 1 research ethics committee.

The semi-structured individual interviews [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="21685" xml_f="21687" txt_i="16352" txt_f="16354">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21694" xml_f="22143" txt_i="16354" txt_f="16803">] were organised around a set of open-ended questions about their experience with the dashboard and/or PICS. The aim of group interviews was to facilitate interactions between participants as a way of collecting rich data. Participants respond not only to the researcher, but also to each other, producing new ideas, questions and priorities. As such, both critical comments and solutions to problems were likely to be generated during discussions [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="22175" xml_f="22177" txt_i="16803" txt_f="16805">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22184" xml_f="22535" txt_i="16805" txt_f="17156">].

Perceptions on clinical decision support encompassed a wide range of views on the clinical useful and relevance of PICS to the work of junior doctors. While the electronic prescribing functions were positively evaluated in enhancing patient safety and reducing the amount of time spent on checking safety information, junior doctors were discriminating in the way they responded to other alerts and warnings given that from their perspective these were not always immediately clinically relevant or within the scope of their responsibility. With regard to feedback on their performance, junior doctors found the dashboard helpful in stimulating reflection on their clinical behaviours and responsibilities. However, they expressed reservations about the sort of performance data that were collected and given as feedback via the JDD. Junior doctors are learners in the clinical environment and the data indicate that the constraints placed on their clinical independence means that they often carry out actions that have been ordered by senior doctors. Thus junior doctors perceived the feedback provided via the dashboard to be an inaccurate account of their own clinical practice given that actions that generate alarms, alerts and warnings in PICS against their log-on IDs had not necessarily been initiated by them, but ordered by senior doctors. Furthermore, doctors’ priorities change in emergencies, and they are less likely to sign off alerts. In other instances there are limitations due to systemic constraints which do not allow for flexibility in prescribing practices in specific clinical contexts where deviation from recommended doses may be clinically indicated.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label><offsets xml_i="32086" xml_f="32093" txt_i="23356" txt_f="23363">Table 2</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="32113" xml_f="32140" txt_i="23363" txt_f="23390">Table of interview excerpts</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="32318" xml_f="32323" txt_i="23391" txt_f="23396">Theme</offsets></bold></th><th align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="32358" xml_f="32376" txt_i="23396" txt_f="23414">Interview excerpts</offsets></bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td rowspan="5" align="left" valign="top"><offsets xml_i="32467" xml_f="32507" txt_i="23414" txt_f="23454">Perceptions of clinical decision support</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic><offsets xml_i="32562" xml_f="32922" txt_i="23455" txt_f="23815">“The alerts and warnings although frustrating at times are very useful in the flagging of things that you may not have seen or thought of and yeah, just the in-built prescribing for certain drugs for particular dosages, which it suggests, obviously that’s great it makes our life a lot easier, we’re not always looking in the BNF (British National Formulary).”</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="32931" xml_f="32956" txt_i="23815" txt_f="23840"> (Individual Interview 9)</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic><offsets xml_i="33020" xml_f="33342" txt_i="23841" txt_f="24163">“The way I use PICS (Patient Information and Communication System) is quite safe and okay there were some alerts which or the warnings that I ignored but there, I wouldn’t ignore say a red SEWS (Standardised Early Warning Score) score box but I would ignore the thrombosis assessment because the patient is on Enoxaparin.”</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="33351" xml_f="33376" txt_i="24163" txt_f="24188"> (Individual interview 3)</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic><offsets xml_i="33440" xml_f="33960" txt_i="24189" txt_f="24709">“I find that it’s quite overwhelming to log on to the system and suddenly see alert after alert (…) but I’ve had a couple of occasions where I’ve been on call and I’ve had a flash-up of an alert on a patient’s observation and it hasn’t been communicated to me in any way by any of the nursing staff and I’ve been able to go and see that patient and find that actually PICS is alerting me to this patient and actually they are quite unwell and probably should have been seen so once or twice I’ve found it very useful.” (</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="33969" xml_f="33992" txt_i="24709" txt_f="24732">Individual Interview 4)</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic><offsets xml_i="34056" xml_f="34245" txt_i="24733" txt_f="24922">“Sometimes you can ignore and sometimes you can accept because sometimes I can’t remember what I was supposed to click (…) because you’re reflecting on what you have to do for the patient.”</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="34254" xml_f="34270" txt_i="24922" txt_f="24938"> (Focus group 2)</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic><offsets xml_i="34334" xml_f="34470" txt_i="24939" txt_f="25075">“Lab alerts and alarms I don’t think are of any relevance whatsoever in my prescribing practice, it doesn’t change the way that I work.”</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="34479" xml_f="34495" txt_i="25075" txt_f="25091"> (Focus group 2)</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" align="left" valign="top"><offsets xml_i="34560" xml_f="34583" txt_i="25092" txt_f="25115">Feedback on performance</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic><offsets xml_i="34638" xml_f="35086" txt_i="25116" txt_f="25564">“I think that’s the only thing that to be honest I kind of took away which was that I was more conscientious about my prescribing.

This was partly because recipients judged the metrics used to feed back performance data not to be a fair reflection of their own clinical competence. Qualitative findings from interviews with junior doctors underlined the fact that in order for a dashboard to be effective, the metrics used need to be concrete rather than abstract and must reflect actual work processes which may be different in different clinical contexts (e.g. working on a day or night shift, or in a surgical or medical speciality). Feedback on metrics over which junior doctors have no behavioural control is likely to lead to disengagement with the process. If junior doctors feel that they cannot be held directly accountable for the feedback that is generated for them, the feedback will lack the ‘moral authority’ to lead to changes in behaviour. Interventions to improve feedback for JDDs will require further development to ensure they are sufficiently tailored to the recipients’ level of clinical responsibility and specifically adapted to the clinical context in which they work.

However, the findings need to be interpreted in the context of certain limitations. First, the sample may have been biased towards volunteers who were already motivated and safety conscious. Second, information on the junior doctors’ demographics was not taken into account in the analysis which may therefore have contained hidden confounding factors. Third, it was not possible to conduct a blinded randomisation due to the nature of the intervention. Fourth, the trial was dependent on junior doctors accessing the JDD to initiate change in behaviour. However, we did not set out to monitor individual participants’ adherence to accessing the dashboard. Finally, caution must be exercised in any attempt to generalise the findings, given the sample size and the specific attributes of the PICS system. The decision support rules that work in the system relating to critical laboratory results and prescription warnings are locally developed with the clinical teams, and whilst care is taken to ensure that these are sensitive and specific to potential harms, the system set-up and user interface may not be optimal for testing junior doctor behaviour.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="47724" xml_f="47734" txt_i="36600" txt_f="36610">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47745" xml_f="48961" txt_i="36611" txt_f="37827">Computerized health care environments— and CDSSs in particular— make it possible to monitor individuals’ responses to warnings generated by their own prescribing activities, and to alerts activated by abnormal laboratory results. We have only been able to provide weak evidence that a clinical dashboard providing individualized feedback data has the potential to improve safety behaviour and only in one of several domains. However, a number of issues have to be taken into consideration when transforming routine monitoring data into an effective educational intervention to improve junior doctors’ safety behaviour. The construction of metrics used in clinical dashboards needs to take account of actual work processes which may be different in different clinical contexts. Feedback on performance must also be credible and reflect actual clinical behaviour to ensure individuals are accountable for the data they generate in the system. Furthermore, it must be within the gift of those receiving feedback to change their behaviour. With appropriate technology, design and metrics in place the JDD can be incorporated into routine practice and assist doctors in developing safe clinical and prescribing practices.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="48983" xml_f="49002" txt_i="37829" txt_f="37848">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49013" xml_f="49071" txt_i="37849" txt_f="37907">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49093" xml_f="49115" txt_i="37909" txt_f="37931">Authors’ contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49126" xml_f="49698" txt_i="37932" txt_f="38500">JJC was the principal investigator and developed the idea for the study.
