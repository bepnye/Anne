Moreover, the symptom burden in patients with sarcoma remains high compared with other malignant diseases. It is, therefore, crucial to assess treatment effectiveness not only in terms of disease-related outcomes (eg, overall survival) but also from an individual and patient-centred perspective using the assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). By focusing on PROs as a primary study endpoint, we aim to address key issues for patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) undergoing palliative treatment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5431" xml_f="5451" txt_i="729" txt_f="749">Methods and analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5462" xml_f="6370" txt_i="750" txt_f="1658">The protocol of the YonLife study describes a multicentre, cluster-randomised, controlled, open-label proof-of-concept study conducted in patients with advanced or metastatic STS treated with trabectedin in seven German hospitals. The primary objective of the study is to exploratively compare overall quality of life between the patients receiving a multidimensional intervention based on individual PROs and those receiving usual supportive treatment. This complex intervention consists of the (1) electronic assessment of PRO, (2) creation of a case vignette based on PRO and clinical data and (3) treatment suggestions based on the discussion of these vignettes in a regularly meeting expert panel. Additionally, the YonLife trial assesses the applicability of a tablet-based assessment of PROs.

Current treatment options for patients with STS are frequently guided by safety considerations and convenience. Therefore, it is important to assess the treatment effectiveness both in terms of objective outcomes (eg, progression-free survival or overall survival) and in terms of subjective patient-reported outcomes (PROs). A widely used definition describes PROs as ‘any report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else’.</offsets><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10059" xml_f="10060" txt_i="4419" txt_f="4420">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10067" xml_f="10068" txt_i="4420" txt_f="4421">

These independently formulated recommendations and consensus were derived in weekly meetings. Consensus was sent to the coordinator in the respective centre. Significantly less patients in the intervention group (56%) than in the control group (71%; p&lt;0.05) experienced impairment of any one of their QoL dimensions 6 months after surgical treatment. This marks a 21% relative risk reduction of experiencing QoL impairments. Patients seem to especially differ in their global quality of life, emotional functioning and fatigue. Unfortunately, such an intervention has not yet been designed or tested for patients with STS. Therefore, the proof of concept for such a complex intervention remains to be investigated. Furthermore, no effect size of such a complex intervention is available in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. This would be required to calculate sample size whenever aiming to conduct randomised controlled trials for proving effects of such a complex intervention. With this in mind, a clinical trial assessing the value and efficacy of such a tailored, patient-directed intervention regarding QoL and exploring effect sizes on various different PRO was designed. This trial entitled ‘Patient Directed Intervention to Improve the Quality of Life for Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma’ (YonLife) includes a complex intervention schedule that uses electronically assessed PROs and expert panel derived treatment recommendations to improve the QoL of patients with STS.

Treatment proposals that are provided to the centres are obtained as described in the following: experts receive case vignettes prior to the meeting. Each expert can suggest treatment proposals and send them to the trial coordinator in case he/she cannot participate in the meeting. Patient’s impaired dimensions are then presented at the meeting and further treatment proposals might be discussed. The multiprofessional team consents on a proposal for supportive intervention.

The primary study endpoint will be analysed by one-sided t-test for independent samples with adjustment for the design effect (inflation factor of the cluster design) comparing total scores of FACT-G of both groups at the end of the intervention phase (visit 4) and assuming a benefit for the multidimensional treatment group. Additionally, results on the primary endpoint will be assured by a mixed-model regression with the cluster included as a nested random effect, the group effect and data of baseline (visit 1) and end of the interventional phase (visit 4). The same statistical approach will be used to analyse the metric secondary study endpoints (HADS, FAACT, BPI, MDASI, IN-PATSAT32). One-sided t-tests for independent samples with adjustment for the design effect favouring the multidimensional treatment group at the end of treatment (visit 4) followed by mixed-model regressions or generalised linear mixed models with appropriate link functions will be applied. Adequate covariates (ie, age, gender, ECOG status) may be included prior to the start of statistical analysis to ensure that the modelling is hypothesis led. Analyses of long-term effects will include data from time points visit 1 as well as visit 4 to visit 7 and will be analysed by mixed-model regressions or generalised linear mixed models with appropriate link functions taking account of possible missing data entries without the need for imputation of data. Time-to-event data (progression-free survival, overall survival) will be evaluated as time-to-event outcomes by Kaplan-Meier estimators and log-rank tests in case of proportional hazards.

The YonLife trial aims to gain knowledge about PROs and to pilot test an interventional pathway to support clinicians in the multidimensional treatment of patients with sarcoma. The present protocol employs a real-time electronic assessment application that uses tablet PCs for obtaining data, calculating scores and automatically transfers the information to a secured database. The effect of such an electronic measurement of PROs between patients receiving standard medical care (PRO assessment without feedback to treatment team) and the intervention group (PRO assessment with feedback to treatment team) will be investigated in this multicentre, cluster-randomised, controlled trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42181" xml_f="43067" txt_i="33435" txt_f="34321">Additionally, the system provides the possibility of comparing calculated scores from obtained PROs with each other and pre-set norm data or reference values directly on the tablet PC. In fact, the YonLife trial uses this functionality to present QoL dimensions that are below reference values as well as the five symptoms of the MDASI answered as most disturbing by the patients. As a result, patients are asked to rank these items according to their individual perceived need of intervention. By applying this approach, an objective measure of patients’ symptom burden and impaired QoL dimensions as compared with the subjectively most relevant individually perceived symptom interference with daily life are obtained. All of these steps function without any additional data transfer or calculation by, for example, a study nurse or documentarian, thus saving both time and resources.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43074" xml_f="44518" txt_i="34322" txt_f="35766">To our knowledge, this will be the first randomised trial to incorporate this kind of priority list into supportive cancer care. Moreover, in the framework of this trial, it will be field tested whether recommendations by a multiprofessional palliative expert team will be able to support the physician and further improve QoL when receiving palliative chemotherapy. Challenges remain when defining an appropriate set of questionnaires to assess PRO in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. To our knowledge, there is no PRO measure available that is specific, disjunctive and exhaustive for symptoms experienced by patients suffering from advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Therefore, several questionnaires addressing different aspects of PROs are used together with clinical variables to give a broad perspective on the patient’s disease and personal status in order to develop individually tailored, patient-directed treatment recommendations. To keep the balance between gaining information and a justifiable number of questions, some questionnaires were kept out of this trial, but may prove beneficial for further research. Another challenging question will be to evaluate whether an expert panel comprising several professions will be able to contribute with additional and valuable information to foster the treating physician. It will be of great interest to determine the compliance and agreement of doctors and patients to such a programme.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44525" xml_f="45337" txt_i="35767" txt_f="36579">Although the complex intervention applied in the YonLife trial was designed with care, areas of uncertainties nevertheless remain. It is still a matter of investigation which clinical data to include in the expert panel’s discussion to overcome the obstacle of not encountering the patients in person. Yet, we conducted non-structured interviews with expert panel members about which information might be useful to them to be included for their respective area of expertise, and a Delphi consensus should be conducted to agree on a common set of necessary information. Additionally, the lack of clinical impression of the patient is challenging as well as the modalities of the presentation of the assessed PROs. There is starting awareness on the unresolved question of how to present obtained PROs graphically,</offsets><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="45369" xml_f="45374" txt_i="36579" txt_f="36584">49 50</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45381" xml_f="45516" txt_i="36584" txt_f="36719"> which is a quite important topic for future research.

The implementation of the priority list represents an innovative and unique way of measuring patients’ subjectively perceived needs for intervention based on a dynamic list of their most impaired symptoms without the need for intermediate scoring. Additionally, the feasibility and potential benefit of a complex intervention based on the individual PROs and recommendations from an expert panel are explored. Ultimately, the YonLife trial will add knowledge about the feasibility and the challenges of electronic assessment of PROs in the setting of a multicentre, randomised trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="47063" xml_f="47085" txt_i="38156" txt_f="38178">Supplementary Material</offsets></title><supplementary-material id="d35e176" content-type="local-data"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="47172" xml_f="47189" txt_i="38179" txt_f="38196">Reviewer comments</offsets></title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-014614.reviewer_comments.pdf"></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e177" content-type="local-data"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="47423" xml_f="47442" txt_i="38197" txt_f="38216">Author's manuscript</offsets></title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-014614.draft_revisions.pdf"></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>The trial is coordinated by GWT-TUD, Dresden, Germany.
