Apart from direct provision of interventions, research has shown that interventions that involve community mobilization and counseling sessions for mothers on topics related to birth and newborn care preparedness for bringing behavior change can reduce total neonatal deaths by 21% and early neonatal deaths by 24% (18). On the other hand, improvement of womenâs access to antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care with training cadre of community workers, and traditional birth attendant can reduce maternal morbidities by 25% and further improve total neonatal mortalities by 23% (18).
