Economic evaluations are necessary to judge whether such interventions are worth the effort. We have evaluated the economic effects of a tailored intervention to support the implementation of guidelines for the use of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs. The tailored intervention was evaluated in a randomized trial, and was shown to significantly increase the use of thiazides for patients started on antihypertensive medication, but had little or no impact on other outcomes. The increased use of thiazides was not expected to have an impact on health outcomes.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st2"><title><offsets xml_i="5620" xml_f="5640" txt_i="724" txt_f="744">Methods and Findings</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5651" xml_f="7080" txt_i="745" txt_f="2174">We performed cost-minimization and cost-effectiveness analyses on data from a randomized trial involving 146 general practices from two geographical areas in Norway. Each practice was randomized to either the tailored intervention (70 practices; 257 physicians) or control group (69 practices; 244 physicians). Only patients that were being started on antihypertensive medication were included in the analyses. A multifaceted intervention was tailored to address identified barriers to change. Key components were an educational outreach visit with audit and feedback, and computerized reminders. Pharmacists conducted the visits. A cost-minimization framework was adopted, where the costs of intervention were set against the reduced treatment costs (principally due to increased use of thiazides rather than more expensive medication). The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was estimated as the cost per additional patient being started on thiazides. The net annual cost (cost minimization) in our study population was US$53,395, corresponding to US$763 per practice. The cost per additional patient started on thiazides (cost-effectiveness) was US$454. The net annual savings in a national program was modeled to be US$761,998, or US$540 per practice after 2 y. In this scenario the savings exceeded the costs in all but two of the sensitivity analyses we conducted, and the cost-effectiveness was estimated to be US$183.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st3"><title><offsets xml_i="7111" xml_f="7122" txt_i="2176" txt_f="2187">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7133" xml_f="7489" txt_i="2188" txt_f="2544">We found a significant shift in prescribing of antihypertensive drugs towards the use of thiazides in our trial.

In our economic analysis of the trial data we found that reduced drug expenditures due to increased use of thiazides did not outweigh the costs of the intervention.

There are two good reasons to believe that this will be the case. Firstly, it is reasonable to believe that most patients who start using thiazides will continue to use these drugs rather than the more expensive alternatives, although many patients will be started on additional drugs regardless of the first drug given. This may translate into savings in subsequent years. Secondly, it is likely that the intervention will continue to influence physicians' choice of antihypertensive medication for new patients beyond the first year after the outreach visit took place. In the trial, the rate of thiazide prescribing to new patients was stable throughout the study period in the intervention group, with the effect showing no sign of waning over time.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28645" xml_f="29054" txt_i="19645" txt_f="20054">Whether it is reasonable to assume that the intervention effect will be sustained beyond 2 y is less certain.

Whether a cost of US$454 for changing a prescribing decision is a good or bad result is unclear.

Thus, for these behaviors the intervention would be more costly but no more effective, i.e., it would represent an inefficient use of resources.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29522" xml_f="30271" txt_i="20510" txt_f="21259">In light of these results, policy-makers need to consider alternative strategies if they wish to influence prescribing more cost-effectively. Recently, authorities in Norway made thiazides mandatory as first-choice medication if patients were to have drug costs reimbursed through the national health insurance system. The effectiveness of this strategy is under evaluation. Another alternative is establishing a maximum level of reimbursement for a group of drugs assumed to be therapeutically equivalent (reference pricing). This strategy has been thoroughly evaluated in British Columbia, Canada, for one class of antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), and was found to lead to substantial savings on health budgets [

Despite savings due to increased use of less expensive drugs, the intervention resulted in a net cost within the 1 y that the trial lasted. However, it is likely that the intervention would lead to modest savings over a 2-y period.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32822" xml_f="33187" txt_i="23480" txt_f="23845">Publicly funded educational outreach programs should perhaps be targeted primarily at improving quality of care rather than costs of health care, given the cost of outreach visits, competition from drug companies, and the availability of alternative strategies for controlling costs (such as reference pricing, pre-authorization, and restrictions on reimbursement).</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title><offsets xml_i="33257" xml_f="33279" txt_i="23848" txt_f="23870">Supporting Information</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd001"><label><offsets xml_i="33355" xml_f="33366" txt_i="23871" txt_f="23882">Protocol S1</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="33390" xml_f="33404" txt_i="23882" txt_f="23896">Study Protocol</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33415" xml_f="33427" txt_i="23897" txt_f="23909">(112 KB PDF)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0030216.sd001.pdf"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="33496" xml_f="33532" txt_i="23910" txt_f="23946">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd002"><label><offsets xml_i="33647" xml_f="33658" txt_i="23947" txt_f="23958">Protocol S2</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="33682" xml_f="33709" txt_i="23958" txt_f="23985">Cost-Minimization Equations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33720" xml_f="33731" txt_i="23986" txt_f="23997">(82 KB DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0030216.sd002.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="33800" xml_f="33836" txt_i="23998" txt_f="24034">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd003"><label><offsets xml_i="33951" xml_f="33962" txt_i="24035" txt_f="24046">Protocol S3</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="33986" xml_f="34014" txt_i="24046" txt_f="24074">Cost-Effectiveness Equations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34025" xml_f="34036" txt_i="24075" txt_f="24086">(24 KB DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0030216.sd003.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="34105" xml_f="34141" txt_i="24087" txt_f="24123">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Luke Vale for helpful comments on the study protocol and for giving critical remarks to a draft of this report.
