General practitioners without previous exposure to post-graduate psychiatric training and those who had not worked in a psychiatric clinic were included. One hundred ninety-one (191) PHC physicians were randomly selected. They were divided randomly into two groups (study and control). The study group was composed of 45 PHC physicians, who were tested in psychiatry pre and post exposure to the intervention training program.
