They slowly exhaled the diaphragmatic-abdominal respiration through the mouth while repeating the word âoneâ. At the same time, they contracted and relaxed each muscle group for 6 and 12 seconds, respectively. They focused their attention on their respiration and on the rising and falling of their abdomen.

We suggest relaxation to improve the psychological status of patients with breast cancer. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer periods (e.g. 3, 6, 9, or 12 months) are recommended to investigate the effects of physical and emotional feelings of cancer patients. This technique can be used as a simple and applicable complementary method in all health centers and even at homes of patients who suffer from depression, anxiety and
