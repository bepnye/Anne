We were informed by the participating pharmacists that patients returned to receiving usual care after the study was completed. Until recently, there was no remuneration system for pharmacists in Alberta, Canada, which was considered as a barrier to follow-up. Disease progression and the lack of optimal insulin dose titration/stopping insulin may have also contributed to this increase. Indeed, it has been reported that patients with type 2 diabetes experience an average loss of 5% of insulin production capacity, per year, after diagnosis.</offsets><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="16777" xml_f="16778" txt_i="9619" txt_f="9620">8</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="16792" xml_f="17525" txt_i="9621" txt_f="10348">The findings of this study highlight the impact of structured pharmacist intervention on glycaemic control in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.

It is also important to note that the gains from the intervention were not completely lost 12 months after completing the study as the baseline HbA1c was 9.1% and 88% of the patients were still taking insulin.
