The guidewire was then removed, and the length and position of the obstruction were determined by the injection of contrast material prior to stent placement. A 0.038-inch-diameter stiff guide wire (Amplatz Superstiff; Meditech/Boston Scientific, Watertown, Mass., U.S.A.) was then introduced. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the whole introductory assembly (a sheath, a compressed stent, and a pusher catheter) was passed over the guidewire into the rectum and advanced until the distal tip of the stent reached approximately 2 cm beyond its stricture. The pusher catheter was held in place with one hand while the sheath was slowly withdrawn in a continuous motion with the other.

Type-C stents caused pain in one case and minor bleeding in three, and in one other there was incomplete expansion. Patient #1 underwent emergency colostomy seven months after stent migration. The type-B stent placed in patient #11 migrated nine days after placement, and was replaced with a type-A stent; relief from bowel obstruction lasted 27 days. In patients #21, in whom a type-A stent was inserted, obstruction recurred due to tumor ingrowth and was confirmed by endoscopy.

In our study, tumor ingrowth was confirmed by fluoroscopy in one patient. We inserted an additional covered stent inside the one which was non-covered, and the patient was subsequently able to defecate well until her death. Minor bleeding developed in five patients in the covered stent group: because a larger introductory system is required, the placement of such stents may be more traumatic. Severe pain developed in one patient in the non-covered stent group, and could not controlled by medication. We believe that in this case the stent should have been removed, but once a non-covered stent is in position, this is not easy. Because of continuous stress on a tumor, that can give rise to stretching pain, the use of stents of a larger diameter did tend to cause pain. In our study, the incidence of this was highest when type-A stents were used, though among different stent types the differences in this regard were not statistically significant.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23452" xml_f="24588" txt_i="17090" txt_f="18226">The HD50 of type-A, -B, and -C stents was 530, 690, and 280 grams of force, respectively. In patient 24, who underwent type-C stent insertion, conventional follow-up radiography revealed incomplete stent expansion, and during the eight-day follow-up period, at the end of which a T-loop colostomy was performed, the patient produced only a small amount of feces. In this case, the type-C stent should have been removed, prior to the insertion of one which was more powerful, such as the type B. In 24 instances of clinically successful stent placement, conventional radiography or fluoroscopic examination demonstrated that in each case, stent expansion was almost complete. All three types of colorectal stents showed good longitudinal flexibility and incorporated anti-migration features such as flaring or shouldering. In our study, the type-C stent had a lower migration rate than the type-B, and according to our results, shouldering might be more effective than flaring. In addition, a stent body constructed in such a way that gaps between segments are small effectively minimizes migration and improves longitudinal flexibility.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24595" xml_f="25099" txt_i="18227" txt_f="18731">The selection of stent type depended on tumor location and size.
