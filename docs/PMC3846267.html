To reach that purpose several factors contributes such as the type of the operation, the scope of the disease and the patient's general condition before surgery.

Despite these efforts there are still patients who have recurrent purulent discharge from the ear that in majority of them the cause is Granulation tissue. Hence the primary aim of ear surgery is delayed. Granulation tissue is the main source of otorrhea and the best way to dry the ear is treating the granulation tissue by topical antibiotic, chemical cutter using acetic acid and so by removing the tissue. However in most patients creating the dry cavity usually takes a long time. “Wet cavity” is common in open approach than close and persistent or temporary otorrhea is about 12-60% (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="6473" xml_f="6474" txt_i="2676" txt_f="2677">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6481" xml_f="6556" txt_i="2677" txt_f="2752">).
