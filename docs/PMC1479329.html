The key finding from the GP focus groups was the difficulty GPs experienced in making screening test information appropriate, relevant and understandable to the individual women. In particular, explaining epidemiological concepts was identified as challenging. GPs experienced significant time pressures in the first consultation in pregnancy and strongly supported the development of a tailored resource. The women's focus groups revealed low level of prenatal screening knowledge and diversity in the amount of information women wanted. To accommodate this a flexible paper-based format was drafted, incorporating the use of summary tables and dot points, as well as more detailed information and a resource list. Consistently women identified difficulty with statistical and numeric expressions and this influenced the use of graphs and diagrams throughout the decision aid. Draft formats of the decision aid were piloted with women who were attending a tertiary prenatal clinic in early pregnancy.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11959" xml_f="12658" txt_i="6300" txt_f="6999">The resultant decision aid is a 24-page information booklet and a risk report.

Linear regression will be used for the other primary outcome, decisional conflict, to evaluate the difference in mean scores between the two arms of the trial. Adjustment will be made for the stratification variable, geographical location (metropolitan/rural), and the following major potential confounding factors: maternal age, education level, gravidity, socioeconomic status and country of birth. Confidence intervals and P values will be adjusted for the effect of clustering and loss to follow-up within clusters will be reported.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33612" xml_f="33700" txt_i="25591" txt_f="25679">Secondary outcomes will use appropriate regression techniques and covariate adjustments.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33722" xml_f="33741" txt_i="25681" txt_f="25700">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33752" xml_f="33808" txt_i="25701" txt_f="25757">The author(s) declare they have no completing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33830" xml_f="33852" txt_i="25759" txt_f="25781">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33863" xml_f="34262" txt_i="25782" txt_f="26169">JH generated the original research question and together with JG, RB, SM, BM &amp; JC developed the project and obtained funding.
