However, effective use of such devices remains limited by conventional (direct) control methods, which rely on electromyographic signals produced from a limited set of muscles. Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR) is a nerve transfer procedure that creates additional recording sites for myoelectric prosthesis control. The effects of TMR may be enhanced when paired with pattern recognition technology. We sought to compare pattern recognition and direct control in eight transhumeral amputees who had TMR in a balanced randomized cross-over study. Subjects performed a 6–8 week home trial using direct and pattern recognition control with a custom prostheses made from commercially available parts. Subjects showed statistically better performance in the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (p = 0.04) and the Clothespin relocation task (p = 0.02). Notably, these tests required movements along 3 degrees of freedom. Seven of 8 subjects preferred pattern recognition control over direct control. This study was the first home trial large enough to establish clinical and statistical significance in comparing pattern recognition with direct control. Results demonstrate that pattern recognition is a viable option and has functional advantages over direct control.</offsets></p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title><offsets xml_i="6143" xml_f="6155" txt_i="1417" txt_f="1429">Introduction</offsets></title><p id="Par2"><offsets xml_i="6176" xml_f="6295" txt_i="1430" txt_f="1549">Amputation of the arm at or above the elbow constitutes a significant disability that can adversely affect life quality</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1"><offsets xml_i="6332" xml_f="6333" txt_i="1549" txt_f="1550">1</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="6346" xml_f="7609" txt_i="1550" txt_f="2813">. People use their arms and hands for a diverse range of activities, from touching and manipulating objects in their environment to interacting with each other through gestures and non-verbal communication. Current prosthetic limbs, whether they are body-powered or myoelectric, remain poor substitutes for a natural arm. Body-powered devices require harnesses to capture mechanical movements from the users and can only restore limited joint movements or degrees-of-freedom (DOFs). Myoelectric control systems allow the user to operate a prosthetic limb by measuring and decoding electromyographic (EMG) signals, which are generated by residual limb muscle contractions. Historically, upper limb amputees use the difference in the EMG signals from a single pair of antagonistic muscles to control a single DOF at a time; this is often referred to as direct control. For transhumeral amputees, electrodes are placed over the biceps and triceps to control a prosthetic elbow. Controlling a hand requires the amputee to use a slow and inconvenient switching mechanism. Controlling a third DOF, such as a wrist, requires yet another switch and becomes quite cumbersome. Recently commercialized powered devices offer great potential in further restoring lost function</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2"><offsets xml_i="7646" xml_f="7647" txt_i="2813" txt_f="2814">2</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="7660" xml_f="7728" txt_i="2814" txt_f="2882">, but remain sorely limited by these conventional recording methods.</offsets></p><p id="Par3"><offsets xml_i="7745" xml_f="7867" txt_i="2883" txt_f="3005">We developed a novel surgical procedure called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) to provide improved myoelectric control</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3"><offsets xml_i="7904" xml_f="7905" txt_i="3005" txt_f="3006">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7912" xml_f="7913" txt_i="3006" txt_f="3007">–</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5"><offsets xml_i="7945" xml_f="7946" txt_i="3007" txt_f="3008">5</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="7959" xml_f="8969" txt_i="3008" txt_f="4018">. In this surgical procedure, severed nerves from an amputated limb are transferred onto residual limb target muscles that no longer have biomechanical function because of the amputation. Target muscles are first denervated so that they can be reinnervated by transferred residual arm motor nerves that previously controlled arm and hand function. Reinnervated target muscles serve as biological amplifiers of the motor nerve commands intended for the missing arm and thus provide physiologically appropriate EMG control signals related to arm/hand function, making prosthesis control more intuitive. For example, after reinnervation of a segment of biceps muscle by the transferred median nerve, contraction of that muscle—as the user attempts to close his or her missing hand—generates EMG signals that provide control input to the prosthesis to close the motorized hand; and conversely, reinnervation of a segment of triceps by the transferred distal radial nerve generates EMG signals that control opening.</offsets></p><p id="Par4"><offsets xml_i="8986" xml_f="9206" txt_i="4019" txt_f="4239">TMR has been a very successful procedure with 23 out of 26 of the first TMR recipients of surgeries performed at Northwestern University and San Antonio Military Medical successfully operating a TMR-controlled prosthesis</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6"><offsets xml_i="9243" xml_f="9244" txt_i="4239" txt_f="4240">6</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="9257" xml_f="9401" txt_i="4240" txt_f="4384">.

The reinnervated muscles contain rich neural information that corresponds to the amputated limb function, including information for the intrinsic muscles of the hand.

Pattern recognition measures EMG signals from a set of residual limb muscles and uses machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from physiologically appropriate muscle contractions. Consequently, there is no need for a switching mechanism, resulting in seamless sequential control of multiple degrees-of-freedom. Pattern recognition myoelectric control systems have now been successfully commercialized by Coapt, LLC (Drs. Hargrove and Kuiken have a financial interest in Coapt, LLC, a company that sells pattern recognition myoelectric control systems. No Coapt products or materials were used in this study). Here, our objective was to present a comprehensive laboratory and home trial to evaluate functional improvements provided by TMR and pattern recognition for individuals with transhumeral amputation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the effects of direct and pattern recognition control in subjects who received the TMR procedure.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title><offsets xml_i="10987" xml_f="10994" txt_i="5743" txt_f="5750">Results</offsets></title><sec id="Sec3"><title><offsets xml_i="11024" xml_f="11043" txt_i="5751" txt_f="5770">Subject Recruitment</offsets></title><p id="Par5"><offsets xml_i="11064" xml_f="11284" txt_i="5771" txt_f="5991">Nine males with transhumeral amputations who had undergone the TMR procedure provided informed consent and were recruited for the study; however one subject withdrew due to back pain unrelated to the study methods (Fig. </offsets><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"><offsets xml_i="11316" xml_f="11317" txt_i="5991" txt_f="5992">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11324" xml_f="11332" txt_i="5992" txt_f="6000">, Table </offsets><xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table"><offsets xml_i="11366" xml_f="11367" txt_i="6000" txt_f="6001">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11374" xml_f="11872" txt_i="6001" txt_f="6499">).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first home trial to compare pattern recognition and direct control methods in subjects who have had TMR, and to demonstrate statistical significance.

It is likely that users performed better on these timed tests using pattern recognition because it allows for seamless sequential control without mode switching. Another contributing factor could have been the nature of the proportional control available to the user. Pattern recognition controls the velocity of movement by considering EMG signals from all of the electrodes rather than just from a single antagonistic muscle pair. As a result, more information is available to control slow and precise movements. There were no significant differences between the control strategies when considering the Box and Blocks Test. Successfully moving blocks only requires flexion and extension of the elbow and opening and closing of the terminal device. Consequently no mode switching was necessary. We believe that this is the primary reason that there were no significant differences between control types for this outcomes measure. In fact, we would not have been surprised if direct control would have performed better, because users had the opportunity to simultaneously operate the elbow and terminal device, which could have resulted in faster movements. We found no significant differences between control types when evaluating the ACMC scores, though six of the eight subjects did perform better using pattern recognition. The ACMC is not a timed test and thus it is possible that this could have had an impact across control comparisons.

The subcutaneous fat was dissected from distal to proximal and saved as a fat flap. The plane between the long and short head of the biceps was identified, widened, and explored to find the musculocutaneous and median nerves.

Many of the terminal devices also incorporated passive wrist flexion and extension. Each subject was fit with two custom fabricated silicone gel liners (Alps Inc.).

Therefore, during the two phases of the study, the device, socket, and subject interface was unchanged, with the exception of the liner where the electrodes locations were moved. All other changes were done electronically. The decoded commands were then sent to the prosthesis and were logged in memory so that home-usage statistics could be determined at the end of the home trial. The amplifier gains were set on a subject specific basis with a typical value of 2000, and data were digitally filtered between 70–450 Hz.
