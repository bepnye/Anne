In total, 101 elderly people, 46 in the intervention group and 55 in the control group, completed the study. The inclusion criteria for the elderly people were permanent residence in nursing homes, cooperation during oral examinations, short stay (less than three months) in the nursing homes, and having no oro-dental and medical interventions within the last three months and during the study. People who had serious changes in their physical health status, received any medical and dental interventions during the study, or started new medications during the study were to be excluded the study. Five people from the intervention group and three people from the control group were excluded because they expired, they were sent to hospital for an acute physical problem, or they returned to their homes. The demographic questionnaire was administered to the elderly people and caregivers. Also, the caregivers were asked to complete the knowledge questionnaire. Ten experts in oro-dental health provided comments that were used to determine the validity of the questionnaires. The internal consistency reliability of the knowledge questionnaire was in acceptable range (Cronbach’s alpha= 0.852). The validity of the oral health assessment tool (OHAT) for the elderly people was confirmed through consultations with dentist supervisors and advisors. Its reliability was evaluated according to data collection by equivalent forms; the Spearman correlation was calculated to be 0.92 between the data from the interobserver reliability (researcher and the colleague), which was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001), indicating very reasonable reliability. Demographic information and knowledge questionnaires were completed by the caregivers in both centers to provide baseline measurements (pre-test). Caregivers at the intervention center were invited to participate in a training program, which consisted of four 90 minutes sessions, twice a week, for 2 weeks.
