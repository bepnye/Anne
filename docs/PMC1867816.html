Only one participant discontinued stretching due to an adverse event. Four events were due to increased pain while stretching, another four were due to calf pain and two due to a new pain in the lower limb. Participants noticed that the use of the wooden wedge placed increased pressure under the heel as the position of the foot on the wedge during the stretching procedure redistributed force away from the forefoot to the plantar heel region. This could have led to the four participants reporting increased pain while stretching. Caution should therefore be used in instructing participants to stretch their calf muscles by raising their forefoot from the ground (e.g. on a book or wedge similar to the one used in this trial). While we chose this form of stretching because it standardised the stretching technique across participants, alternative stretching methods that do not place increased pressure on the plantar heel (e.g. lowering the heel while the forefoot is on a step) may avoid such an adverse event.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23812" xml_f="24661" txt_i="18442" txt_f="19291">The findings of this trial need to be viewed in light of some limitations. Firstly, the evidence from this trial is for one particular technique of stretching the calf muscle. Although participants reported being able to feel a stretch, no increase in ankle range of motion was found. Other stretching techniques such as lunges (dynamic stretching), proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, or using splints (e.g. night stretching splints) may yield other results. The stretching technique we utilised – using a wooden wedge – ensured a suitable stretch was applied in a relatively controlled manner. Secondly, the trial specifically examined the effect of stretching over a two-week period as a short-term treatment for plantar heel pain; generally the period a patient waits for the fabrication of a longer-term treatment such as foot orthoses [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"><offsets xml_i="24693" xml_f="24695" txt_i="19291" txt_f="19293">29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24702" xml_f="25051" txt_i="19293" txt_f="19642">]. It would be of interest to evaluate the effectiveness of regular stretching over a longer period to investigate whether the intervention has a long-term effect.
