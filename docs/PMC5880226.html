Within the differential diagnosis, research into medical factors such as anemia, cardiac failure, thyroid problems, apnea, dyspnoea, renal failure, and the like has priority. In the event that such factors can be found, a medical intervention will be started initially. If there are no indications for any of these factors, a multimodal approach is recommended that focuses on mental processes (reduction of stress, anxiety, and depression), physical activity (better energy balance) and sleep. Psycho-education, both for patients and their social environment, should be part of the interventions.

This gives the users the much needed context to start and the motivation to continue with the program.

Every two weeks the users will also fill in their own Vase of Energy (see </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1"><offsets xml_i="9742" xml_f="9750" txt_i="5326" txt_f="5334">Figure 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9757" xml_f="9866" txt_i="5334" txt_f="5443">).

After the basics the user gets access to the Daily Program, the backbone of this all-embracing app. The Daily Program consists of four components: (1) My physical activity, (2) My themes, (3) My exercises and (4) Tip of the day (see </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3"><offsets xml_i="10187" xml_f="10195" txt_i="5687" txt_f="5695">Figure 3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10202" xml_f="10304" txt_i="5695" txt_f="5797">).

Each and every day, users can chose for themselves in which order they go through the Daily Program. For example ‘My physical activity’ can be the first daily component of the app. It motivates users to become sufficiently physically active. In the first place users learn to spread their energy better throughout the day and the week. Thereafter they get simple and concrete guidelines to gain more physical strength and condition (f.e. take the stairs instead of the elevator). The aim is to be daily active in a moderate way during at least 30 minutes. In addition, it encourages the user to create a better understanding of how activities gain or cost energy, and to spend energy more consciously. Secondly, ‘My themes’ is the gateway to an extensive program that incorporates the recommendations from NCCN seamlessly: fatigue, boundaries, worry, anxiety, physical activity, sleep, self-care and nutrition. Each theme contains psycho-education (orally and in writing), animations, tips and considerations. Users can pick the theme they are interested in and can interchange easily. They are free to do it at their own pace and in the order that suits them best. Some in-depth texts are placed in the library, for those who are interested in reading more about a certain theme. The third component, ‘My exercises’, contains a variety of stress-reduction exercises (e.g. breathing, body scan, meditation, mindfulness, yoga exercises) and activities that will help the users to identify, manage and release stress every day. Finally, in the ‘Tip of the day’, a focus point, incentive thought, or advice is presented each day. The tips are meant to initiate a good mood and stem especially from positive psychology. On the home page, components that have been accomplished in the Daily Program are highlighted, to motivate the user to engage in the app in all four manners.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12280" xml_f="12651" txt_i="7761" txt_f="8132">Besides the Daily Program, the app provides the means to incorporate a social environment for the user in three ways: (1) a feature to share results of the quick scan with caregivers, (2) the possibility to involve one or more ‘buddies’ (for example partner, friends, colleagues, etc.), and (3) a social platform to allow users to share their experiences with each other.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12658" xml_f="12832" txt_i="8133" txt_f="8307">At this moment ’Untire’ is the first and only app worldwide that offers a concrete, comprehensive and easy-to-use self-management program to cope with cancer-related fatigue.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="12854" xml_f="12860" txt_i="8309" txt_f="8315">Future</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12871" xml_f="13479" txt_i="8316" txt_f="8924">An English language version of the app was launched in March 2018.
