exercise program composed to induce interests and assertive participation of adults with
cerebral palsy on the self-efficacy and activities of daily living, as well as to provide
basic clinical data that are effective and trustworthy in enhancing the physical and
emotional interaction in the future. [Subjects and Methods] Those among the 23 adult with
cerebral palsy who are the subjects of research and able to participate only in the
evaluation of measurement tools prior to and after the experiment were allocated to the
control group while only those who can participate in the group exercise program
implemented over 12 sessions were allocated to the experimental group. For the control
group, a range of motion of joint exercise and stretching exercise were executed on the
arms, legs and trunk, while for the experimental group, group exercise that is implemented
with participation of several subjects simultaneously was executed 2 times a week with 40
minutes for each session over a period of 6 weeks for the total of 12 sessions. [Results]
In both the experimental group and the control group, there were statistically significant
changes in the average scores of self-efficacy and activities of daily living after the
exercise in comparison to that prior to the exercise. Moreover, there were statistically
significant differences in self-efficacy and activities of daily living in terms of
quantity of change prior to and after the exercise between the two groups. [Conclusion]
Therefore, group exercise program composed to induce physical and emotional interaction,
and active participation of adults with cerebral palsy can be considered as an effective
intervention method in improving their self-efficacy and activities of daily living.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Group exercise</kwd><kwd>Self-efficacy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="5295" xml_f="5307" txt_i="1861" txt_f="1873">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5318" xml_f="5508" txt_i="1874" txt_f="2064">Adult with cerebral palsy is accompanied by chronic pain as the secondary problem arising

In fact, disabled persons are prone to
having distorted cognition of one’s body or activities due to loss of parts of the body,
functional impairment and emotional disability, and may display difficulties in social
adaptation including interpersonal relationship or group life because of low self-efficacy
and sociability. In addition, since loss of such abilities further reduces the movement and
interaction ability of the bodily parts in accordance with the environmental change for the
efficient performance of exercise, the activities of daily living of adult with cerebral
palsy including self-care, transfer and locomotion, communication and social cognition, etc.

Those
with cerebral palsy has the passive tendency of not doing things oneself, and weakening of
motivation for repetitively taking up challenges due to the lack of confidence arising from
having experienced having repetitive failures on the attempt for movements and behaviors as
one grows because of disability in posture and exercise. Accordingly, cerebral palsy lowers
the self-efficacy of a person as one becomes adult, thereby increasing actual fear towards
activity performance and failure to maximally demonstrate one’s potentials. As such, it is
important to induce the patients to put in even greater efforts with attention necessary for
the task situation by improving the self-efficacy. In this study, the quantity of changes in
self-efficacy of the adult with cerebral palsy in the experimental group who performed 6
weeks of group exercise program significantly increased more than that of the subjects in
the control group. This is believed to be the result of the improvement in confidence of
research subjects in the experimental group on their own capabilities by studying a diverse

of changes in the activities of daily living in the experimental group in comparison to the
control group when group exercise program was executed on adults with cerebral palsy for 6
weeks. This is determined to be the results of experiencing of automatic and natural
movements by performing the group exercise activities by adults with cerebral palsy and
advancement of the integrated ability of adults with cerebral palsy to execute cognitive,
social and behavioral functions to appropriately coping with the environmental demands such
as other persons and new tasks. Although many physiotherapists have the concern that group
exercise program, when compared to individual customized therapy as a method of one-on-one
therapy, could result in substantially reduced attention, group exercise can be seen as a
highly beneficial intervention method for adults with cerebral palsy since it can provide
increase in health and mobility as well as a diverse range of benefits that can lead to
improvement of participation in daily life and quality of life additionally on the basis of
the results of this study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30063" xml_f="30186" txt_i="21058" txt_f="21181">The group therapy program executed by interacting with peer constituent members is more

the same goal of winning the game as members of the same team in this study also since
boccia exercise, a sports for disabled persons with cerebral palsy, is executed as a group
formatted competition activity. That is, adult with cerebral palsy could not only learn new
tasks and concepts by performing group exercise program but also acquire social skills
though responding interaction on the basis of the actions of colleagues by paying attention
to the actions of other participants, thereby improving the participation in daily life and
quality of life.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="31246" xml_f="32181" txt_i="22135" txt_f="23070">Accordingly, group exercise program executed on adult with cerebral palsy can improve

the participants, and improve the activities of daily living through physical activities
that enable them to learn functional and cognitive things. Moreover, the program enables the
patents to perform interesting and challenging therapy along with the experience of comfort
of engaging in the program with other disabled persons with cerebral palsy. The finding of
this study showed to be the results of self-efficacy promotion by performing the group
exercise program of adults with cerebral palsy. That is, self-efficacy will be responsive to
environmental change, which facilitates success and increases long-term motivation and will
improve their efforts toward change when they were in unresponsive environment. High level
