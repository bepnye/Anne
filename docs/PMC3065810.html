In this two-condition randomized clinical trial, the intervention condition included: (1) a computer-based tracking system designed to facilitate follow-up of patients who were initially seen for a CHD clinical event at UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMMMC); (2) an initial inpatient contact and a series of coordinated patient-centered pharmacist-delivered telephone counseling contacts to improve adherence to prescribed medications. The tracking system was developed based on a communication system using Lotus Notes from IBM (Lotus Notes R5.0.11). Eligibility data, demographic information, and contact and proxy contact information were entered into the system. The system was shared by the study team. We used it to track eligible and ineligible patients, and facilitate timely scheduling of assessments and intervention sessions.

A patient was eligible for the study if he/she was between the ages of 30 and 85 years and had CHD defined as the presence of at least one coronary lesion ≥50% at the time of coronary angiography. Patients could have a history of prior CHD, or this could have been their first such diagnosis. Patients were excluded if they were unable or unwilling to give informed consent in English, had a history of intolerance to two or more statin drugs, planned to move out of the area within one year of recruitment, had a poor prognosis such that life expectancy was estimated to be &lt;5 years, had a major psychiatric illness, or had no telephone. </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10803" xml_f="12616" txt_i="6247" txt_f="8060">Patients were randomly assigned to the UC condition or to the PI condition. The UC condition consisted of normal clinical care as determined by the patient's provider. Patients in the PI condition were seen by one of the study pharmacists prior to discharge. This allowed the pharmacist to establish a relationship with the patient, explain the pharmacist's role in the study, provide education about all discharge medications including a medication card which listed all medications and their manner of use, and set the framework for the follow-up telephone calls. The pharmacist-delivered telephone counseling calls took place at two weeks, and at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months following discharge. The goal was to assist patients to remain adherent to prescribed statins and other medications, and also promote adherence to AHA guidelines for LDL-C. During these calls, pharmacists utilized a patient-centered counseling algorithm (address general issues, assess, advise, assist, arrange follow-up; see the appendices for details) to help patients develop a medication adherence plan. In addition, the pharmacist facilitated scheduling of repeat blood draws for lipid measurement and provided information, guidelines; and prompts to the patient and to the patient's physician or nurse practitioner with regard to LDL-C management. Specifically, the provider received an emailed summary of the discussion after each pharmacist contact with the patient. The email included three categories (i.e., adherence, CAD, and hyperlipidemia) along with recommendations for each. At the in-patient visit, patients in the PI condition were also provided an educational packet, a dietary goal booklet, and a pillbox.

An additional one-hour role-playing session was completed within 2 weeks of the first training session, and provided further opportunities for role-playing potential patient scenarios. During the individual session the pharmacists were provided with immediate feedback regarding their counseling skills, and had an opportunity to correct problems. For quality control, one of the investigators (Dr. Milagros C. Rosal) listened to telephone call recordings monthly for the first 2 months and then bimonthly through year 2. Two booster sessions were conducted within the 2 years of the study intervention, providing the pharmacists with feedback on their counseling skills and eliciting discussion of challenges encountered with patients.

Fourth, our intervention focused on patients' medication adherence; although pharmacists made recommendations about putting patients on statins to patients' primary care physicians via telephone, e-mail, and letters, this part of intervention was not a primary focus of the study.
