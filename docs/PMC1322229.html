The aim of the present study, therefore, was to assess the reliability, validity and responsiveness of the RLSQoL in a larger sample size, over a longer period of time (12 weeks) and with treatment intervention. Thus, this study is based on the patient populations of two recently completed, matching, phase-III, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies assessing the efficacy and tolerability of ropinirole, a dopamine agonist, for the treatment of patients with RLS (Therapy with Ropinirole: Efficacy And Tolerability in RLS [TREAT RLS] 1 and 2).

The sample sizes in the 'mild' groups were very small, and the results for these groups should, therefore, be interpreted with caution. However, RLSQoL overall life impact scores for the 'moderate' CGI-S groups were statistically significantly different from those for the 'severe' CGI-S groups in both studies. Of note, although these studies did not assess 'mild' RLS patients, the original validation did assess this group (in addition to patients with moderate and severe RLS). The combination of these results indicates the clinical validity of the RLSQoL in mild, moderate and severe groups [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="36196" xml_f="36198" txt_i="29837" txt_f="29839">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36205" xml_f="36207" txt_i="29839" txt_f="29841">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36214" xml_f="37364" txt_i="29842" txt_f="30992">The responsiveness of the RLSQoL to change over time was confirmed by comparing change scores from baseline to week 12 with clinicians' perceived changes (CGI-I). Correlation of changes in RLSQoL overall life impact score with CGI-I scores was moderate and statistically significant in both studies. RLSQoL overall life impact change scores were able to distinguish between CGI-I subgroups at a statistically significant level in both studies. RLSQoL scores were improved in patients rated by their clinicians as 'improved', as well as in those patients rated by their clinicians as 'unchanged'. However, effect sizes indicated the improvements were consistently 'large' in those patients rated as 'improved' but only small or moderate in those rated as 'unchanged'. Sample sizes for the worsened groups were small and results for these groups should be interpreted with caution. Improvements in the 'no change' CGI group suggest the potential presence of the 'Hawthorne effect'; that is, a response shift most probably due to positive psychosocial effects of participating in a clinical trial, regardless of the specific nature of any intervention [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"><offsets xml_i="37396" xml_f="37398" txt_i="30992" txt_f="30994">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37405" xml_f="37407" txt_i="30994" txt_f="30996">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37414" xml_f="38179" txt_i="30997" txt_f="31762">The sensitivity of the RLSQoL to worsening RLS severity could not be fully evaluated in this study owing to the small sample size of worsening patients, and should be investigated further in a larger sample of worsening patients at the first opportunity. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the RLSQoL is responsive to worsening until further research is conducted. Furthermore, due to the inclusion criteria for the trials, there were very few patients who were rated by their clinician as being 'normal, not at all ill', 'borderline ill' or 'mildly ill' at baseline (1.27%, 1.27% and 8.18%, respectively, from the CGI-S at baseline).
