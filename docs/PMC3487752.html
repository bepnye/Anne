Over 6 months, participants in Motivational Interviewing and Health Education receive 4 individual counseling sessions and participants in Brief Advice receive one brief in-person individual session at baseline. Rigorous monitoring and independent verification of fidelity will assure the counseling approaches are distinct and delivered as planned. Participants complete surveys at baseline, week 12 and 6-month follow-up to assess demographics, smoking characteristics, and smoking outcomes. Participants who decide to quit are provided with a self-help guide to quitting, help with a quit plan, and free pharmacotherapy. The primary outcome is self-report of one or more quit attempts lasting at least 24 hours between randomization and 6-month follow-up. The secondary outcome is biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence cessation at 6-month follow-up. Hypothesized mediators of the presumed treatment effect on quit attempts are greater perceived autonomy support and autonomous motivation.

Principles of MI include using a collaborative style, eliciting individuals’ reasons for change rather than persuading, and supporting autonomy so that individuals do not feel pressured to change and can feel autonomously or “internally” motivated. These principles are manifested in communication methods (e.g., open-ended questions, affirming, and reflective listening) that are used to strategically elicit and enhance the individual’s elaboration of “change talk” (statements in the direction of making a change) and increase their awareness of the discrepancy between their current behavior and their perception of what would be ideal behavior.

Counselors point out the link between participants’ current symptoms and their smoking. In the absence of symptoms counselors underscore that the best thing that participants can do for their health is to quit smoking. Second, counselors describe major long-term (e.g., heart-disease) and short-term (e.g., slower wound healing) risks of smoking (4–5 at each session) and provide education on one of a variety of smoking related topics (i.e., content of cigarettes, costs of smoking, the addictive nature of tobacco, luring of smokers by tobacco companies, and the dangers of second-hand smoke). Third, counselors discuss the potential rewards of quitting including short and long-term health benefits. Fourth, counselors ask about participants’ roadblocks to quitting and provide suggestions or counterarguments for each. Finally, counselors provide personalized advice underscoring the importance of cessation and ask participants if they are interested in making a plan to quit.

For the same reason, the study focuses on building motivation and generating quit attempts and is not powered for the secondary aim of determining group differences in 7-day point prevalence abstinence. The trial aims to obtain effect-size estimates for the MI intervention relative to HE and BA on cessation that will inform future studies. Based on the 2:2:1 allocation ratio the target sample is therefore 255 (102 MI, 102 HE, and 51 BA).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="35277" xml_f="35290" txt_i="26778" txt_f="26791">Data analyses</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="35301" xml_f="36178" txt_i="26792" txt_f="27669">All analyses will be conducted in an intent-to-treat manner. Our primary analyses will utilize a planned comparisons approach to compare the proportion of those making at least one quit attempt for HE and MI, and for BA and MI, using logistic regression. If preliminary analyses comparing groups on baseline variables suggest potential confounding effects by any covariate, these will be included in the logistic regression models. For the secondary hypotheses we will also use logistic regression to compare the effectiveness of HE and MI, and MI and BA, on 7-day point prevalence abstinence at follow-up. To evaluate autonomy support and autonomous regulation as mediators of the presumed effect of MI on quit attempts, and weeks of pharmacotherapy use as a mediator of the presumed effect of MI on cessation, we will follow the procedural steps outlined by Baron and Kenny [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"><offsets xml_i="36210" xml_f="36212" txt_i="27669" txt_f="27671">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36219" xml_f="36267" txt_i="27671" txt_f="27719">] using logistic regression and the Sobel test [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"><offsets xml_i="36299" xml_f="36301" txt_i="27719" txt_f="27721">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36308" xml_f="36309" txt_i="27721" txt_f="27722">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40"><offsets xml_i="36341" xml_f="36343" txt_i="27722" txt_f="27724">40</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36350" xml_f="36352" txt_i="27724" txt_f="27726">].</offsets></p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title><offsets xml_i="36408" xml_f="36418" txt_i="27730" txt_f="27740">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36429" xml_f="37628" txt_i="27741" txt_f="28940">Although MI is a promising tool for healthcare providers who regularly encounter low motivated smokers, stronger evidence for its efficacy is needed to justify the additional training and maintenance of skills needed for this approach. This study is designed to provide the most rigorous evaluation of MI to date, focusing specifically on smokers not motivated to quit and examining quit attempts as the primary outcome. Examination of quit attempts rather than cessation conserves resources but will provide a strong preliminary indication of the potential efficacy of MI for tobacco treatment in this population. A much larger sample size would be necessary to power a trial in which cessation is the primary outcome. However, the secondary outcome of smoking cessation at 6-month follow-up in this study will provide an effect size estimate that can inform the design of future MI trials focused on cessation. On the other hand, should MI fail to prove more efficacious than brief advice or health education, it would encourage reconsideration of the current Clinical Practice Guideline and prompt further research to develop more powerful intervention methods to motivate smokers to try to quit.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37650" xml_f="37663" txt_i="28942" txt_f="28955">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37674" xml_f="37744" txt_i="28956" txt_f="29026">MI: Motivational interviewing; HE: Health education; BA: Brief advice.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37766" xml_f="37785" txt_i="29028" txt_f="29047">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37796" xml_f="38086" txt_i="29048" txt_f="29338">Varenicline (Chantix ®) was provided by Pfizer through Investigator Initiated Research Support (No. WS759405).
