The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of Newfactan® with that of Surfacten® in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Newfactan® or Surfacten® was randomly allocated to 492 newborn infants who were diagnosed as RDS and required surfactant instillation in four participating hospitals. The comparisons were made individually in two subsets of infants by birth weight (&lt;1,500 g group [n=253] and ≥1,500 g group [n=239]). Short-term responses to surfactant and acute complications, such as the total doses of surfactant instilled, response type, extubation rate, ventilator settings, changes in respiratory parameters, air leak, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage, and mortality during the 96 hr after surfactant instillation were measured. Long-term outcome and complications, such as total duration of intubation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and periventricular leukomalacia, and ultimate mortality were measured. There were no significant differences in demographic and perinatal variables, short-term responses to surfactant and acute complications, and long-term outcome and complications between Newfactan® and Surfacten® in both birth weight groups. We concluded that Newfactan® was comparable to Surfacten® in the clinical efficacy in the treatment of RDS in both birth weight groups.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Newfactan®</kwd><kwd>Surfacten®</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary Surfactants</kwd><kwd>Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title><offsets xml_i="6848" xml_f="6860" txt_i="1476" txt_f="1488">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6871" xml_f="7113" txt_i="1489" txt_f="1731">Pulmonary surfactant is the cornerstone of the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the newborn infants.

In Korea, Surfacten® and Exosurf® came into the market in 1990, and Curosurf® in 1996. Surfacten® and Curosurf® are modified natural surfactants derived from bovine and porcine lung, respectively. While on the other, Exosurf® is a purely synthetic surfactant. However, Exosurf® has dropped out of the market before long, and Surfacten® imported from Japan has been the most commonly prescribed pulmonary surfactant for the treatment of RDS in the newborn infants in Korea since the first clinical report by Namgung et al.

However, because of the high cost of Surfacten®, the need for less expensive domestic pulmonary surfactant agent has emerged. Thereupon, Newfactan®, a semi-synthetic pulmonary surfactant derived from bovine lung, was co-developed by a domestic pharmaceutical company and a medical college. Both in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the efficacy of Newfactan® (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="8256" xml_f="8257" txt_i="2691" txt_f="2692">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8264" xml_f="8266" txt_i="2692" txt_f="2694">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="8297" xml_f="8298" txt_i="2694" txt_f="2695">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8305" xml_f="8376" txt_i="2695" txt_f="2766">).

In that study, a total of 60 newborn infants were enrolled with 30 infants in each surfactant group. There were no differences in the efficacy in the treatment of RDS, the incidence of complications, and mortality between Surfacten® and Newfactan® groups. However, this study has some limitations as the authors mentioned in the discussion. Firstly, the number of the newborn infants enrolled was small because only two centers participated in the study. Secondly, the study lacks the data on the extremely low birth weight infants, especially the infants with birth weight of less than 800 g, whose survival rate has improved dramatically recently. Therefore, further comparative studies with the larger number of newborn infants, especially the extremely low birth weight infants whose birth weight was less than 1,000 g are required to verify the comparability of Newfactan® to Surfacten® in clinical efficacy in the treatment of RDS. Therefore, we did a multi-center clinical comparative study enrolled a fairly large number of the newborn infants, especially the extremely low birth weight infants. A total of 112 extremely low birth weight infants were included in our subjects.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="10050" xml_f="10071" txt_i="4249" txt_f="4270">MATERIALS AND METHODS</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="10091" xml_f="10099" txt_i="4271" txt_f="4279">Subjects</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10110" xml_f="10691" txt_i="4280" txt_f="4861">A total of 492 newborn infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care units in four hospitals: Samsung Seoul Hospital; Samsung Cheil Hospital; Kangnam Cha Hospital; and Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital and diagnosed as RDS, and judged to require pulmonary surfactant instillation therapy between May 2002 and July 2004 were enrolled.

The results of the first clinical comparative study were already published in 2000 (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="21730" xml_f="21731" txt_i="14736" txt_f="14737">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21738" xml_f="22494" txt_i="14737" txt_f="15490">). However, because it had a relatively small sample size and lacks the population of extremely low birth infants whose birth weight was less than 800 g, further large-scale clinical study has been required. Our study has a clinical significance in that it is a multi-center study enrolled as many as 492 newborn infants, especially 112 extremely low birth weight infants whose birth weight was less than 1,000 g. Although the data were not shown, like in &lt;1,500 g group and ≥1,500 g group, there were also no statistically significant difference in the short-term responses and acute complications and long-term outcome and complications between Newfactan® group and Surfacten® group in the subgroup of infants whose birth weight was less than 1,000 g.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22501" xml_f="23894" txt_i="15491" txt_f="16875">The two surfactants were alternatively allocated with stratified block randomization, which is &lt;1,500 g and ≥1,500 g block. However, at a part of participating hospitals where the infants with a birth weight of less than 1,500 g were in the minority, the allocation was done without stratification. This seems to be the origin of the size discrepancy between the two surfactant groups in &lt;1,500 g group. Due to the vague reliance on Surfacten® over Newfactan®, the attending physicians seem to have prescribed Surfacten® instead of Newfactan® in Newfactan's turn of the original allocation order at those hospitals when the birth weight of newly enrolled infant was less than 1,500 g, resulting in the disruption of the original allocation order. This problem of disordered randomization may be a major drawback of our study. Nevertheless, the results of our study are not thought to be nullified. We also compared the outcome by stratifying the subject infants by birth weight. After the stratification, there were no statistically significant differences in demographic and perinatal variables between the two surfactant groups in both &lt;1,500 g group and ≥1,500 g group. This implicates that the two surfactant groups in each stratum are similar in baseline conditions and therefore comparable to each other. Therefore, the results of our study are considered to remain to be valid.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23901" xml_f="24560" txt_i="16876" txt_f="17532">The reason why we stratified the subject infants by birth weight is that the etiology and clinical course of RDS in each subgroup were considered to be different. The etiology of RDS in &lt;1,500 g group may be primarily attributable to absolute deficiency of pulmonary surfactant pool and its course may be complicated due to a number of problems arising from the prematurity itself. On the other hand, the etiology of RDS in ≥1,500 g group may be more complex. Besides the absolute deficiency of surfactant pool, conditions that lead to secondary surfactant inactivation such as asphyxia, infection and aspiration of meconium or blood might be responsible (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="24591" xml_f="24592" txt_i="17532" txt_f="17533">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24599" xml_f="24601" txt_i="17533" txt_f="17535">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><offsets xml_i="24633" xml_f="24635" txt_i="17535" txt_f="17537">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24642" xml_f="25558" txt_i="17537" txt_f="18450">). However, the clinical course of RDS in ≥1,500 g group may be, if not all, uncomplicated. Once the RDS has resolved, the majority of infants in this group seem to go uneventful until the discharge. This rationale for the stratification seems to be partially validated by our data. The extubation rate, the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hemorrhage, and high-grade intraventricular hemorrhage, and short-term mortality during the 96 hr after surfactant instillation, total duration of intubation, and the ultimate mortality were significantly different between &lt;1,500 g group and ≥1,500 g group. However, contrary to our expectation, the total doses of surfactant instillation and the response to surfactant instillation therapy were not different between the two birth weight groups.
