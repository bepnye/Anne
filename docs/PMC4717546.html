However, the standard of care in such homes is always criticized.

An independent t-test will be adopted to compare the knowledge and skills of care staff between the two groups. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) will be used to compare the two groups in terms of their performance in the knowledge and skills tests, as well as in PU status over time, and to examine the groups by the time interaction effect, adjusting for the cluster effect and possible confounders.

According to the researcher’s experience from previous studies on preventing pressure ulcers, there are several potential challenges to the implementation of this protocol. First, insufficient PU prevention materials in for-profit private nursing homes, including pressure-relieving mattresses, seating cushions, and heel protectors, will be a barrier to the implementation of the protocol [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26"><offsets xml_i="31818" xml_f="31820" txt_i="23948" txt_f="23950">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31827" xml_f="32253" txt_i="23950" txt_f="24376">]. Second, the inadequate manpower and high workload of care staff in for-profit private nursing homes will likely affect staff compliance with the protocol. Finally, there is the high turnover rate of nursing home care staff, which will affect the quality of the care that is delivered, including the quality of the PU prevention care. The new care staff will need to be trained in the knowledge and skills in PU prevention c</offsets></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>GEE</term><def><p>Generalized estimating equation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HWs</term><def><p>Health workers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBS</term><def><p>Modified braden scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCWs</term><def><p>Personal care workers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p>Principal investigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PU</term><def><p>Pressure ulcer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RA</term><def><p>Research assistant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCHs</term><def><p>Residential care homes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NH</term><def><p>Nursing home</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors’ contributions</bold></p><p>EWYK: She is the first author and the Principle Investigator (PI) of this study.
