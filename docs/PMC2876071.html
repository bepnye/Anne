The primary outcome measure is the difference in the birth weight post intervention versus control women, adjusted for birth weight of the first child, i.e. the difference between intervention and control groups in the change in gender and gestational age adjusted birth weight achieved. The sample size required depends on a significance level set at conventional level of 5% and power set at conventional level of 90%. To detect a 0.25 SD difference in birth weight- this is equivalent to a 102 g difference in the birth weights achieved in control and intervention groups one would need 360 women in each group. A sample size of 360 women in each group will have 90% power to detect a difference of at least 100 g in birth weight between control and intervention groups. Thus 720 women will be randomised to 'no intervention' or to 'low glycaemic index diet.
