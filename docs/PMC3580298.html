We excluded patients with the following: prostate cancer, with or without medical or surgical treatment; administration of 5α-reductase inhibitors or sex hormone agents; severely impaired BPH requiring surgical treatment; other urological diseases affecting urinary tract symptoms; and life-threatening conditions.

The CGIC requires the patient to complete the sentence, "Compared with before starting treatment, would you describe your problem as…," with "much worse," "worse," "slightly worse," "no change," "slightly better," "better," or "much better" as responses. When patients answered "better" or "much better," they were grouped as nonescalators; the others were chosen as escalators.

The increase in the IIEF-5 score was two-fold higher in escalators (3.3) than in nonescalators (1.5). This comparative result may indicate that α1-AR antagonists contribute to the improvement of EF through a mechanism that may directly cause relaxation of the adrenergic tone of the corpus cavernosum in a dose-dependent fashion. However, this trial involved open-label and non-placebo controls, which can affect subjective outcome.

These findings indicate that α1-AR antagonists may contribute to the improvement of EF through a mechanism that may indirectly cause improvement in LUTS and QoL as well as directly cause relaxation of the corpus cavernosum in a dose-dependent fashion.
