Proactive outreach includes mailed invitation materials followed by an outreach call that encourages smokers to seek treatment with choice of services. Proactive care participants who choose telephone care receive VA telephone counseling and access to pharmacotherapy. Proactive care participants who choose face-to-face care are referred to their VA facility's smoking cessation clinic. Usual care participants have access to standard smoking cessation services from their VA facility (e.g., pharmacotherapy, smoking cessation clinic) and from their state telephone quitline. Baseline data is collected from VA administrative databases and participant surveys. Outcomes from both groups are collected 12 months post-randomization from participant surveys and from VA administrative databases. The primary outcome is self-reported smoking abstinence, which is assessed at the population-level (i.e., among those who utilize and those who do not utilize tobacco treatment).

Currently, tobacco cessation treatment relies on reactive treatment approaches that require smokers to either initiate treatment or to have a clinical encounter in which the provider has the time, initiative, and capacity to offer and deliver smoking cessation care.

For example, a smoking cessation program may result in a 50% increase in quit rates among those utilizing the program but if only 2% of smokers utilize the program, the population impact would be 1%.

Proactive treatment approaches have great potential to integrate individual and population-based perspectives and increase the population impact of tobacco cessation treatment by increasing the utilization of treatment with higher effectiveness. Despite their great potential to increase reach of more effective treatment, to date, there has been limited use of proactive treatment approaches for tobacco cessation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9731" xml_f="10933" txt_i="4735" txt_f="5937">In this paper, we describe the study design and methods of a prospective randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of a theory-driven intervention combining 1) proactive outreach with 2) choice of telephone care or face-to-face care for treatment of tobacco dependence (proactive care) compared to reactive care (usual care).

Medication costs in the VA are subsidized and may be free or a nominal co-pay of $9 per prescription is charged to Veteran depending upon their eligibility status. Participants may also be referred to a smoking cessation clinic from which they receive intensive counseling, which consists of behavioral and cognitive strategies to quit smoking. Behavioral counseling usually occurs in a group setting and participants are encouraged to attend at least 4 sessions, lasting 30-60 minutes, which are held once or twice per week.

MI is an appropriate intervention for smokers at all levels of readiness to quit and entails asking the participant to talk about the pros and cons of the behavior and how the behavior fits in with his/her values and plans for the future. Important features of MI are an emphasis on collaboration with the participant, respect for his/her autonomy, and a goal of understanding the participant's point of view. The counselor avoids confrontation and takes advantage of many opportunities to enhance self-efficacy by pointing out and reinforcing patient strengths and successes. Recommendations for action are presented in the form of menus (i.e., the participant is provided choices).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20200" xml_f="20722" txt_i="14597" txt_f="15119">Second, the intervention reduces barriers for smokers who have had or anticipate having negative medical care experiences and/or mistrust medical care by offering a program that does not require a medical care encounter.

One barrier to the use of proactive treatment approaches is difficulty identifying current smokers in the general population.

All smokers, regardless of motivational level to quit smoking are included, and therefore, findings will have greater generalizability than traditional clinical trials. However, the intervention combines two main components (proactive outreach and the option of telephone care); therefore, if it has a positive effect on population-level smoking abstinence rates, it will be difficult to determine which component(s) are responsible.
