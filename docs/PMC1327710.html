Eight 75-minute weekly sessions were held at a community center (evening) and at a local church (noontime). Sessions were presented by the same instructor and staff, using a curriculum that described benefits and barriers to exercise, its relationship to health and cancer risk, and personal assessment/problem-solving sessions for motivation. Didactic, interactive, and small-group processes were used during each session. Steps-only pedometers were tested, and progressive step goals were provided. Participants scheduled walking times for the upcoming week and reported steps walked per day for the previous week using scheduler/tracker forms.

The breast cancer survivor participants were motivated and compliant with the intervention, which likely enhanced their success. Having had cancer and understanding their risk of recurrence may account for the strong motivation we found in this population, as suggested by the constructs of the Health Belief Model. It is also important to note that the sample participants all had more than a high school education, which may also have contributed to their success.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17600" xml_f="18009" txt_i="13431" txt_f="13840">Although we found only a few statistically significant differences in mean body measures in relationship to time since diagnosis, we may have detected more evidence of this pattern had we had a larger study sample.

This was not surprising given the focus of the intervention sessions on overcoming personal obstacles to exercise. However, the attitudinal improvement did not hold at three-month follow-up. Although steps per day did not significantly change at three-month follow-up, one might wonder if the decline in exercise attitude might eventually negatively influence exercise behavior after a longer time interval. Cancer stress scores did not change significantly over the course of the intervention. However, scores for this variable were not particularly high even at the start of the intervention. This could be related to the fact that only 18% of participants were diagnosed during the 12 months prior to the start of the study. Cancer stress may subside as time passes after a woman's diagnosis. Had we studied a group of more recently diagnosed women, we may have found more evidence of cancer stress at baseline and potential for impact after the exercise intervention than we did the with this study population.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20645" xml_f="20656" txt_i="16317" txt_f="16328">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20667" xml_f="21214" txt_i="16329" txt_f="16876">This study was limited by the study size and lack of control group.

The study showed strong feasibility measures in positive response to using pedometers, high participant retention, social support, and excellent compliance after eight weeks. Given data indicating obesity is associated with shorter breast cancer survival time, these study results may position breast cancer survivors to have both improved quality of life and reduced risk of cancer recurrence. Further study is needed to test a randomized comprehensive diet and exercise intervention in African American breast cancer survivors against controls in a longer, larger randomized trial with additional study variables.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded through a competitive peer-reviewed grant initiative by the Massey Cancer Center at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>American Cancer Society</collab></person-group><year>2003</year><publisher-loc>Atlanta (GA)</publisher-loc><source>Cancer facts and figures 2003</source>
