We investigated whether 25% sodium reduction in a top-selling bread affected sales in 26 remote Indigenous community stores.

While the values at baseline and follow up in the intervention group correspond with this, the difference from the change in the control group was not statistically significant.

It may have been underpowered to detect a difference in the outcomes, particularly sodium density. In sensitivity analysis, there was a significant reduction in sodium density if one control store was dropped. Further, when salt reduction was modelled across all breads, the projected reduction was statistically significant, despite the change in effect size from the original analyses being small. This suggests that the variation in the data may have been larger than the effect size, precluding a significant result. This is less of a concern for the sales-related outcomes; while market share was trending towards a reduction compared to control, average weekly dollars was slightly increased, although neither were statistically significant. Further, sensitivity analyses were consistent in indicating no significant effect on sales; therefore, we are confident in our conclusion that sales were not affected.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33705" xml_f="34053" txt_i="24999" txt_f="25347">A further limitation is that we were unable to randomise the study.

We tested the bread in a “real-life” setting by replacing the regular product with the lower sodium product on store shelves, rather than conducting testing in a research setting. Our study population included a considerable number of communities spread over a large geographical region with a high proportion of consumers of the study bread. Our main study outcomes were objective, and we collected data on all food and drink sales during the study period, which allowed us to track change in market share of the product and to examine whether sodium reduction was compensated for by increasing sodium density of other purchases. We were also able to determine the impact on sales, an outcome considered of key importance to manufacturers.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-09-00214"><title><offsets xml_i="35800" xml_f="35814" txt_i="26975" txt_f="26989">5. Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="35825" xml_f="36615" txt_i="26990" txt_f="27780">There is considerable potential for further sodium reduction in breads to reduce population salt intakes in remote Indigenous Australian communities. We found that it was possible to reduce salt by 25% in a top-selling bread without affecting sales in remote Indigenous community stores. This adds to the evidence that considerable sodium reductions can be made in bread without jeopardising commercial viability. Twenty-five percent salt reduction across all breads could reduce estimated salt intake in remote Indigenous Australian communities by approximately 15% of the magnitude needed to achieve the WHO target, which has the potential to lead to health gains at the population-level. More wide-spread reductions across the food supply will help to meet the WHO salt reduction target.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to the Act on Salt research collaborative; Independent Grocers; Goodman Fielder; Arnhem Land Progress Aboriginal Corporation (ALPA); Outback Stores (OBS); and participating communities and store employees.
