Effectiveness was measured by the QALY. The model assumed that patients transitioned among four health states (normal, mild, moderate and severe), defined by the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale. Transition probabilities were estimated in an ordered logit model using patient-level data from a multicentre, 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, where subjects (n=461) continued their stable morning stimulant and were randomized to GXR administered in the morning, GXR administered in the evening, or placebo. The model assumed that patients in moderate/severe health states after week 8 would discontinue ADHD treatment and remain in that state for the rest of the study period. Direct costs included drug wholesale acquisition costs and health state costs, all in $US, year 2010 values. Utility associated with each health state was obtained from the literature and disutilities associated with adverse events were applied for the first 4 weeks. Oneway sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted by varying costs, utilities, adverse-event duration, and transition probabilities.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5360" xml_f="5367" txt_i="2051" txt_f="2058">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5378" xml_f="6125" txt_i="2059" txt_f="2806">Compared with maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy, adding GXR to existing stimulant monotherapy was associated with an incremental drug cost of $US1016 but a lower medical cost of $US124, resulting in a total incremental cost of $US892 at 1 year. The addition of GXR to stimulants led to an incremental QALY of 0.03 and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $US31 660/QALY. In one-way sensitivity analysis, ICER values ranged from $US19 723, when 100% of patients were assumed to be severe in their initial health state, to $US46631, when the last observed states from the clinical trial were carried forward to the end of the 1-year analysis period.

Transition probabilities to other health states were re-estimated based on the ratios between these probabilities in the base case and the new probability of remaining in the same health state in the PSA. The calculations ensure that transition probabilities from a given health state to all four states sum to one. For medical costs and utilities, the inputs for the normal state were included as random variables. Gamma distribution was used for the cost variable assuming that the mean cost equalled the standard deviation; Beta distribution bounded by 0 and 1 was used for the utility variable. To ensure that medical costs increase with disease severity and utilities decrease with disease severity, the values for each other state (i.e. mild, moderate and severe) were re-estimated by applying the ratio between that state and the normal state in the base case to the new value for the normal state in the PSA. In addition, the durations of all AEs were varied simultaneously by randomly drawing from a Uniform distribution from 0 to 8 weeks.

The base-case analysis showed that although adding GXR as an adjunctive therapy increased ADHD drug costs, the costs could be partially offset by the difference in medical costs. In addition, the combination of GXR and stimulants led to, on average, 0.028 higher QALYs than stimulants alone. While the disutility associated with AEs was higher for those patients taking GXR and stimulants because of the added pharmacotherapy, this was offset by the increases in utility associated with symptom improvements. With the ICER of $US31 660/QALY, GXR as an adjunctive therapy to stimulants would be considered as cost effective at a WTP threshold of $US50 000/QALY. The one-way sensitivity analyses conducted in our study found that the results were most sensitive to the assumptions about the transition probabilities. When the transition probabilities observed in the trial were used and patients were assumed not to transition beyond week 8, the model generated the highest ICER of $US46 631/QALY. This is not surprising as we assumed that the impact of the combination therapy was limited to only within the trial period – a conservative assumption against combination therapy. Other drivers of the results included the distribution of health states at the model entry and unit ADHD drug costs. However, none of the ICERs exceeded $US50 000/QALY. It is worth mentioning that although assumptions had to be made to estimate medical costs associated with each health state, the results were not sensitive to these assumptions. Even if we completely eliminated the medical costs in the model estimation, the ICER was similar to the base-case value. While there is substantial debate in the US surrounding the use of cost effectiveness for decision making, CEAs are increasingly being used to support formulary reimbursement and tier status placement.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36"><offsets xml_i="41890" xml_f="41892" txt_i="33252" txt_f="33254">36</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41899" xml_f="42028" txt_i="33254" txt_f="33383">] A review of published CEAs demonstrated that 34% mentioned an explicit threshold, with the median threshold of $US50 000/QALY.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37"><offsets xml_i="42061" xml_f="42063" txt_i="33383" txt_f="33385">37</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42070" xml_f="42280" txt_i="33385" txt_f="33595">] However, recent research demonstrates that a threshold of $US50 000/QALY is likely significantly lower than the WTP threshold within the US for a QALY, which is more likely between $US100 000 and $US300 000.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38"><offsets xml_i="42313" xml_f="42315" txt_i="33595" txt_f="33597">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42322" xml_f="42550" txt_i="33597" txt_f="33825">] Therefore, the use of a $US50 000/QALY threshold can be seen as a lower bound for the value of a QALY, implying that even under conservative assumptions, GXR as an adjunctive therapy to stimulants is good value for the money.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39"><offsets xml_i="42583" xml_f="42585" txt_i="33825" txt_f="33827">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42592" xml_f="42593" txt_i="33827" txt_f="33828">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42600" xml_f="42692" txt_i="33829" txt_f="33921">Suboptimal response to stimulants is not uncommon among children and adolescents with ADHD.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1"><offsets xml_i="42724" xml_f="42725" txt_i="33921" txt_f="33922">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42732" xml_f="42733" txt_i="33922" txt_f="33923">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12"><offsets xml_i="42766" xml_f="42768" txt_i="33923" txt_f="33925">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42775" xml_f="42776" txt_i="33925" txt_f="33926">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40"><offsets xml_i="42809" xml_f="42811" txt_i="33926" txt_f="33928">40</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42818" xml_f="43197" txt_i="33928" txt_f="34307">] These patients may be difficult to treat because they have fewer FDA-approved treatment options after stimulant therapy.

Although not all patients follow this treatment rule in the clinical setting, this may be a realistic assumption because most patients achieve optimal dosing within 8 weeks.

However, results from the one-way sensitivity analyses showed that the results were not sensitive to the assumptions used to estimate costs for each health state. Even if we conservatively assumed that all medical costs were zero, the ICER was still similar to the base-case value. Furthermore, data from different studies were applied in the model with the underlying assumption that the populations in these studies were comparable.
