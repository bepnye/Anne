The cyclists maintained the same dietary and training regimen for the three days prior to the second two-hour cycling bout, and consumed the same amount of water during the second as the first two-hour cycling bout.

However, there also appeared to be increases, though not significant, in our placebo group of 5 mmol/kg and 10 mmol/kg and for creatine phosphate and total creatine, respectively. These data, in combination with our performance data demonstrating an increased performance that was not dependent upon the type of supplementation (creatine or placebo), highlight the importance of using a placebo group and a double-blind protocol. Although Hultman et al. included a placebo group in their study design, they did not take muscle biopsies from the control group.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="43122" xml_f="43133" txt_i="33943" txt_f="33954">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="43144" xml_f="43201" txt_i="33955" txt_f="34012">The present data support the findings of Hultman et al.

The creatine supplementation was also associated with higher pre-exercise body weight as well as higher muscle glycogen concentration and plasma volume near the end of two hours of cycling after creatine supplementation compared to placebo. It can be concluded that 28 days of creatine supplementation increased resting muscle creatine phosphate, muscle glycogen content and plasma volume during exercise. The creatine supplementation was not different from placebo in improving performance of a sprint to exhaustion at the end of a two-hour cycling bout interspersed with eight sets of three 10-second sprints.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="43986" xml_f="43999" txt_i="34738" txt_f="34751">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44010" xml_f="44173" txt_i="34752" txt_f="34915">ANOVA: Analysis of variance; ANCOVA: Analysis of covariance; ATP: Adenosine triphosphate; CP: Creatine phosphate; CR: Creatine; RER: Respiratory exchange ratio; VO</offsets><sub><offsets xml_i="44178" xml_f="44179" txt_i="34915" txt_f="34916">2</offsets></sub><offsets xml_i="44185" xml_f="44213" txt_i="34916" txt_f="34944">peak: Peak aerobic capacity.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44235" xml_f="44269" txt_i="34946" txt_f="34980">Declaration of Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44280" xml_f="44338" txt_i="34981" txt_f="35039">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44360" xml_f="44382" txt_i="35041" txt_f="35063">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44393" xml_f="44872" txt_i="35064" txt_f="35543">RCH participated in protocol design, conduct of the study, data analysis and manuscript preparation.
