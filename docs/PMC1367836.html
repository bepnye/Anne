A total of 2,196 participants were recruited from the local population and randomized into bathers and non-bathers. Bathers were exposed for 10 min and had to immerse their head at least three times. Water samples for microbiological analysis were collected at 20-min intervals. Unbiased concentration–response effects with no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were demonstrated for three different definitions of gastroenteritis and four fecal indicator organisms. Relative risks for bathing in waters with levels above NOAELs compared with nonbathing ranged from 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2–2.6) to 4.6 (95% CI, 2.1–10.1), depending on the definition of gastroenteritis. The effect of swallowing water provided additional evidence for true dose–response relationships.

Recreational water quality standards are intended to protect the health of those consumers who are not already immune or resistant to pathogens that may be associated with indicator organisms. In contrast to current World Health Organization recommendations, we concluded that standards should be based on rates of compliance with NOAELs rather than on attributable risks determined above NOAELs, because these risks depend mainly on the unpredictable susceptibility of the cohorts. Although in theory there is no threshold in real concentration–response relationships, we demonstrated that a NOAEL approach would be a more robust and practical solution to the complex problem of setting standards.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bathing</kwd><kwd><italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></kwd><kwd>fecal indicators</kwd><kwd>fecal water pollution</kwd><kwd>fresh recreational water</kwd><kwd>gastroenteritis</kwd><kwd>health risks</kwd><kwd>intestinal enterococci</kwd><kwd>somatic coliphages</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><offsets xml_i="6755" xml_f="7259" txt_i="1856" txt_f="2360">Recreational waters are monitored worldwide to protect the health of bathers from infectious diseases caused by waterborne pathogens that are associated with the pollution of natural recreational waters by human and animal feces, and the results of monitoring are the basis for corrective action where necessary.

This conclusion has been based primarily on the fact that the randomized controlled trial design minimizes nondifferential misclassification bias resulting from the inaccurate assignment of microbial concentrations in the water to exposed participants. However, to this day, results from only one study of this kind are available for exposure to seawater. The results presented here are the first ever collected in a randomized controlled trial in fresh water. In addition, this randomized controlled trial is the first to study a cohort that includes children and teenagers, who usually make up a considerable percentage of the visitors at public bathing sites.</offsets></p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><offsets xml_i="8936" xml_f="8957" txt_i="3831" txt_f="3852">Materials and Methods</offsets></title><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="8996" xml_f="9008" txt_i="3853" txt_f="3865">Study sites.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9019" xml_f="9191" txt_i="3866" txt_f="4038">We performed the present study at five German freshwater bathing sites.

Finally, individual exposure concentrations for all microbiological parameters were assigned to each bather by calculation of the arithmetic mean concentration of the 10 individual exposure minutes. Participants with unacceptable exposure data were excluded from further analysis. Exposure data were considered to be unacceptable if the participants did not comply with their randomization status, if they entered the water too early or too late, or if the total exposure time was less or more than 10 min.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20650" xml_f="20671" txt_i="14252" txt_f="14273">Exposure definitions.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20682" xml_f="21099" txt_i="14274" txt_f="14691">We defined exposure in two different ways.

It takes into account the fact that the participants followed the instructions to immerse their heads at least three times to a varying extent. Because each immersion of the head could be looked on as an equivalent for the uptake of a certain small amount of water via the eyes and the lacrimal duct, the nose and throat, and the mouth, the minute-specific concentrations of all minutes during which the head was immersed were multiplied with the number of head immersions during each of these minutes and added. The result can be considered to be the theoretical equivalent of a single head immersion at that concentration. This second theoretical definition of exposure was therefore called “single head immersion.”</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21945" xml_f="22005" txt_i="15511" txt_f="15571">Calculation of incidence rates, RRs, and attributable risks.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22016" xml_f="23305" txt_i="15572" txt_f="16861">We calculated incidence rates as the number of cases with onset of disease in the week or the 3 weeks after exposure divided by the number of individuals observed during these periods in a defined exposure category [nonbathers, bathers, bathers exposed below or above no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs), bathers exposed in quartile or quintile categories of microbial concentrations], and used percentage as the unit of measurement. We calculated RRs as the incidence rates among participants in a defined exposure category (bathers or bathers exposed above NOAELs) divided by the incidence rates among unexposed participants (nonbathers). We calculated attributable risks (aRs) as the difference between the incidence rates (percent) observed in two different exposure categories (e.g., incidence rates of bathers above NOAELs minus the incidence rates of non-bathers). Initially, we compared the crude incidence rates of disease among bathers and nonbathers, the crude RRs, and the crude aRs after the 1-week evaluation interval with those after the 3-week interval. After it became obvious from this comparison that there was no additional scientific benefit from using the 3-week interval, all subsequent analyses concentrated on the results obtained within a period of 1 week.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23327" xml_f="23351" txt_i="16863" txt_f="16887">Determination of NOAELs.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23362" xml_f="23675" txt_i="16888" txt_f="17201">To determine potential NOAELs, we sorted participants by their individual exposure concentration in ascending order.

NOAELs mainly depend on the pathogen:indicator ratio (the higher the ratio the lower the NOAEL) and on the intensity of exposure (the more intense the exposure the lower the NOAEL). The measurable susceptibility of a cohort depends on the degree of immunity—the percentage of individuals who can be infected—and on the percentage of infected individuals who develop symptoms, because only symptomatic disease will be reported.

For example, they should provide a certain degree of protection not only for the local population under endemic conditions but also for tourists who may have a completely different susceptibility status with respect to a typical pattern of pathogenic organisms to which local residents are already adapted. In addition, standards should also protect the consumers’ health in the situation of epidemics caused by newly introduced pathogens, when even the local population may be extremely susceptible. Therefore, the highly variable cohort susceptibilities that can be observed in epidemiologic studies investigating the risk of acquiring gastroenteritis from recreational water contact should not play a determining role in the setting of standards. Instead, the standards should be based solely on acceptable rates of compliance with guide values that correspond to experimentally and empirically verified NOAELs.
