However, CDPT demands substantial time and effort from patients to maintain these benefits; the treatments are not always well-accepted, and patients may suffer from a deterioration in quality-of-life or a time-dependent loss of initial treatment benefits. A new device designed for home use by the patient, the Flexitouch™, has been developed to mechanically simulate MLD.

The biodesign of the device and its impact on the disease state confer some distinct theoretical advantages. Because the Flexitouch™ is bioengineered to closely simulate the effects of correctly performed simple manual lymphatic massage, it should theoretically minimize the effect of improper or inadequate technique upon the treatment outcome. Furthermore, because the device emphasizes comfort and minimizes the active participation of the patient, it should, in principle, optimize compliance.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24784" xml_f="25884" txt_i="19625" txt_f="20725">Indeed, our observations suggest that, even in short-term use, the device confers therapeutic benefit over that which can be attained through standard therapy. In addition to the demonstrable small, but significant, improvement in edema volume, the statistically significant reduction in body weight that accompanies the use of the Flexitouch™ serves as an independent confirmation of the added efficacy of this approach for the reduction of edema volume. While the magnitude of weight loss cannot be entirely explained by the quantitative reduction in limb edema volume, the concurrent changes seem to validate the beneficial impact of the Flexitouch™. The phenomenon of weight loss certainly bears additional investigation in larger numbers of patients. The current study was not designed to specifically address this response and, therefore, additional study with control of relevant variables during the treatment phase, such as fluid intake, diet, exercise, and medications, will be required to validate the observed phenomenon and to address the potential mechanisms of the therapeutic benefit.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25891" xml_f="26859" txt_i="20726" txt_f="21694">The current, pilot study is limited chiefly by the small sample size and short duration of the therapeutic intervention. The positive results suggest that further investigation will be useful. When observed in larger cohorts of patients, with treatment phases sustained over longer intervals, it can be anticipated that even more substantial volume benefits might be demonstrable. In addition, quality-life-indicators should theoretically have the capacity to detect any favorable impact of streamlined therapy upon perceptions of the disease state. Finally, it will be desirable to attempt to demonstrate the theoretical favorable impact of this intervention upon tissue architecture and other chronic structural consequences of lymphedema. It is well-recognized that lymphedema, with chronicity, occasions the secondary proliferation of fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and adipocytes, the accumulation of collagen, and the destruction of elastin fibers within the skin [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"><offsets xml_i="26891" xml_f="26893" txt_i="21694" txt_f="21696">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26900" xml_f="27344" txt_i="21696" txt_f="22140">]. It has been hypothesized that effective physiotherapy of lymphedema can diminish or eliminate these otherwise inexorable consequences. It is relevant that, in a recent study of the effect of therapeutic intervention upon lymphatic filariasis, the institution of even simple measures to reduce edema possessed the capacity to ameliorate the histopathological manifestations of chronic inflammation and fibrosis in punch biopsies of the skin [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"><offsets xml_i="27376" xml_f="27378" txt_i="22140" txt_f="22142">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27385" xml_f="28254" txt_i="22142" txt_f="23011">]. While such direct histological confirmation may not be as readily derived from a breast cancer-associated lymphedema population, future, more extensive studies of the therapeutic potential of the Flexitouch™ might realistically incorporate other, more indirect attempts to document an ameliorative effect upon tissue architecture. Furthermore, evaluation of patients during more protracted use of the device, if it indeed enhances treatment outcome while minimizing the incursion of self-management upon the activities of daily living, would be predicted to disclose an improvement in perceptions of psychosocial and physical well-being.
