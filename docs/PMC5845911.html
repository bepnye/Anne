This panel recruits people by a variety of methods, including random-digit-dial telephone calls, USPS mailings, and advertising on social networking websites. After individuals join the panel and participate in surveys, quality checks of their responses are performed. We will employ a standard practice recommended by the online survey company, that is, for participants who complete surveys too rapidly (i.e., one-third the median length of the survey response time) will be disqualified from participation in the study because of a concern that they will not be carefully processing the questions’ language and intent, nor accurately formulating their responses.

Apps can be used on parents’ own time and in the comfort of their home. Because safety recommendations are usually provided as a one-size-fits-all recommendation, parents may need information that is customized to the features in their home and to the ages of their children. Thus, this research seeks to provide home safety information, using innovative communication technology. The app can be used on their own time, in their own home, and does not rely on or involve clinicians or a medical setting and is widely available. The use of a mobile app improves upon the “one-time” nature of some brief interventions by allowing the participant or app user to revisit the app and complete safety actions as frequently as desired and to set reminders for themselves for future actions. The information provided can change as the child ages in order to be relevant for the child’s age and development, or addition of new children to the family, as well as protecting persons of all ages residing in the home.
