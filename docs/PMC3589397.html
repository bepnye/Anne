Given the general mechanisms by which priming affects behavior–that an individual’s mental representation of markets is the result of the individual’s experiences with markets–we can interpret our results as evidence in favor of the hypothesis that market participation increases trust. We stress, however, that this is cautious evidence; a wider array of evidence is necessary for the solidification of this conclusion. For example a desirable complementary piece of evidence would be a method that involves the direct elicitation of expectations and that does not suffer from the drawbacks we describe in footnote 2.Our results also encourage further studies on which components of trust are most affected by market participation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47523" xml_f="47919" txt_i="31942" txt_f="32338">Absent markets, economic interactions with strangers tend to be negative.

Alternatively it could be caused by the belief about anonymous strangers affecting trust and trustworthiness differently. Context may affect trust via the belief of the trustworthiness of an anonymous stranger and may affect the trustworthiness of the anonymous stranger via the image that the anonymous stranger has of himself. It could also be that markets affect trust and trustworthiness through different channels: through markets one learns that anonymous strangers are trustworthy and therefore one becomes more trustful, and through markets one learns that positive reciprocity generates positive payoffs and therefore one becomes more trustworthy.

Thus the desirability of an increase in trust does not depend upon there being a concomitant increase in trustworthiness.
