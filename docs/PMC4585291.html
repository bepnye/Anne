Parents consider that the virtual environment requires more intensive parental monitoring. This includes explicit demands to access what the adolescent often perceives to be “private content” or to impose time limits on Internet use. Parents who felt they had lost control also typically felt they had lost the ability to protect their child from harm. In some cases, this perceived lack of control makes the Internet a source of parental fear and high conflict. This was particularly impactful on the parent’s confidence and role definition since it clashed strongly with their view that protection is one of the parent’s primary roles. The theme of parents’ compromised ability to protect their children was perhaps exaggerated due to the clinical nature of the sample whose depressive disorder may render them more susceptible to the influences of the Internet and SM (</offsets><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="43712" xml_f="43713" txt_i="30243" txt_f="30244">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43720" xml_f="43721" txt_i="30244" txt_f="30245">–</offsets><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="43752" xml_f="43753" txt_i="30245" txt_f="30246">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43760" xml_f="43931" txt_i="30246" txt_f="30417">).
