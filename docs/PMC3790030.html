Therefore, spinal anesthesia and the inclulsion of elderly patients in the current study might be contributing factors to the decreased requirement for dexmedetomidine. Finally, we have chosen the RSS score of 3 as it meets the condition of conscious sedation, which is a minimally decreased level of consciousness preserving the patients' ability to maintain their airway independently and to respond appropriately to physical stimulation or verbal command [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"><offsets xml_i="19811" xml_f="19813" txt_i="14902" txt_f="14904">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19820" xml_f="20758" txt_i="14904" txt_f="15842">]. The incidence of inadequate sedation with RSS score below 3, thus necessitating midazolam administration, was comparable between the three groups and showed no statistically significant correlation with the dose of dexmedetomidine. Although statistically not significant, the RSS scores of group C after dexmedetomidine administration tended to be higher than those of group A or B. When taking into consideration that conscious sedation provides additional advantages including preserved airway reflex and rapid recovery, increased dose of dexmedetomidine may not offer any beneficial effects compared to low dose, such as the 0.25 µg/kg/hr of the current study, in terms of adequate sedation. Collectively, the results of the current study clearly indicate that dexmedetomidine 1 µg/kg followed by continuous administration at an infusion rate of 0.25 µg/kg/hr may be appropriate for sedation of patients receiving spinal anesthesia.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20765" xml_f="20777" txt_i="15843" txt_f="15855">Although SpO</offsets><sub><offsets xml_i="20782" xml_f="20783" txt_i="15855" txt_f="15856">2</offsets></sub><offsets xml_i="20789" xml_f="21109" txt_i="15856" txt_f="16176"> values significantly decreased after dexmedetomidine administration compared to baseline values, clinically significant desaturation did not develop in the current study.

First, dexmedetomidine dose-dependently increased the development of hypotension but not that of bradycardia in the current investigation. Thus the differential effects of dexmedetomidine on the blood pressure and heart rate should be further investigated in a future study, particularly under spinal anesthesia. Second, because the doses of continuous intravenous dexmedetomidine in the current study were based on a previous study, we did not investigate the effect of doses lower than 0.25 µg/kg/hr. Third, we did not assess the differences among the groups regarding analgesic consumption in the PACU and the duration of sensory or motor blockade produced by spinal anesthesia.

Delayed recovery from spinal anesthesia may be beneficial in cases of surgery of long duration but harmful in the ambulatory care setting. Finally, we did not consider the effect of age in relation to sedative dose. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the optimal sedative dose of dexmedetomidine that will provide both hemodynamic stability and adequate duration of spinal anesthesia.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24363" xml_f="24948" txt_i="18955" txt_f="19540">In conclusion, supplementation of spinal anesthesia with intravenous dexmedetomidine produced an adequate level of sedation in all patients that enabled patient's cooperation without inducing significant respiratory depression. However, the development of hypotension was observed as a dose-dependent side effect of dexmedetomidine. We suggest that intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine 1 µg/kg followed by continuous administration at an infusion rate of 0.25 µg/kg/hr may be an appropriate dose for providing adequate sedation
