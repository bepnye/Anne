With regard to all above-mentioned issues and since the men (who are more susceptible to gastric cancer) eat mostly at home, in addition to the important role of women in cooking and low cost of their educational programs, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of gastric cancer education based on Health Belief Model on knowledge, attitude, and nutritional practice of homemakers, in order to promote public health.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10729" xml_f="12004" txt_i="4874" txt_f="6149">This is an interventional and experimental study conducted in Isfahan, Iran, in year 2009-2010. The subjects comprised 84 homemakers under coverage of health centres. The sampling was random. First, a list was made containing all health centres in Isfahan, and then, two centres were randomly selected as study and control. Inclusion criteria were women 18-60 years of age, being a homemaker, being under cover of a health centre and literate, and having an available phone number for follow- ups. Exclusion criteria were not being interested in joining the study and subjects’ covering centre change. The subjects were invited to join the study by telephone calls and were confirmed that their personal information would be kept secret. Finally, consent was obtained from each subject. The subjects in study and control groups were identical concerning socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as lack of gastric cancer history in their relatives. The sample size was calculated as 32 subjects in study and control groups. To prevent possible subjects’ drop, 48 subjects were employed for study and 48 for the control group.

It was filled by the subjects in the study and control groups before and 2 months after education. The questionnaire contained some sections and included seven questions on demographic characteristics, 33 questions on knowledge measurement, 39 questions on attitude in dimensions of Health Belief Model (perceived susceptibility, 17 questions; perceived severity, 5 questions; perceived benefit, 4 question; perceived obstacles, 7 questions; perceived self-efficacy, 6 questions), and 20 questions on practice measurement. Score 1 and 0 were assigned to “correct” and “wrong or no idea” responses in scoring of knowledge. The scoring of various dimensions of Health Belief Model was in Licker’s scale (from absolutely agree to absolutely disagree) scored from 0 to 4. Questions on practice were in form of self-report and four choices (no, sometimes, usually, always) which were scored from 0 to 3. Finally, all scores (knowledge, pattern dimensions, and practice) were converted to percentage in range of 0-100. The questionnaire was designed through referring to textbooks and scientific resources and was modified by seven experts in health and nutritional education to confirm scientific validity. The questionnaires were also distributed among another 15 homemakers, not included in the study, and were modified based on meaning and clarity, and finally, were justified to define face validity. The reliability of the questionnaire was obtained through filling the questionnaire by 30 subjects not included in the study and via internal consistency and Cronbach’s alpha: questions of knowledge α= 0.78, perceive susceptibility α= 0.83, perceived severity α= 0.84, perceive benefits α = 0.74, perceived obstacles α= 0.76, perceived self-efficacy α= 0.81 and practice α = 0.76.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14065" xml_f="16833" txt_i="8198" txt_f="10966">After completion of the questionnaire by both groups, the educational program was designed based on pre-test results and structures of health belief model. Educational intervention in study group was directly conducted through lecture, collaborative methods, combined with questions and answers, group discussion and brain storming. First, the subjects in study group were divided into two identical groups, and educational program (seven educational 40-50 min sessions at 9-10 and 10-11 a.m.) was administrated for each group with coordination of the head of exam centre in education connector’s hall. In the first session at the beginning, lecture method was employed due to low information in most of the subjects to make them familiar with gastric cancer, its pathology, effective risk factors lowering elements, healthy and unhealthy foods in relation with gastric cancer, and health issues in prevention of Helicobacter pylori through slides presentation. Then, with regard to adults’ education theory which pointed out free discussion as a necessity part of education, the subjects held group discussion. In the second session with regard to perceived severity structure, a person whose father had died of gastric cancer was invited to talk about the severity of gastric cancer complications as he had closely experienced the pain. Next, group members freely discussed about the complications in their relatives with gastric cancer, and later in the session, related complications of low health, and sings of Helicobacter pylori infection were discussed by the subjects. In the third session with emphasis on perceived susceptibility structure, the hazards of high intake of fried foods, canned food, fast food, leftovers, and high intake of salt that predisposes the individuals to gastric cancer were mentioned. Then, the importance of following cooked food preservation principles and disinfection of vegetables, washing hands after toilet and before eating and preventing use of a shared glass and spoon at the table were magnified in the session. In the fourth session, the subjects had group discussion on benefits and advantages of healthy point’s compliance in prevention of helicobacter infection and gastric cancer related nutritional issues including function of gastric system, having more self-confidence in preservation of health, prevention of other cancers, and cost efficacy of gastric cancer prevention. In the fifth session, in order for activating subjects’ brain storming in education, all the inhibiting obstacles in subjects’ compliance of health and nutritional issues were indicated and related strategies were mentioned.

The last session with regard to subjects’ practice was devoted to disinfection of vegetables and fruits, and the homemakers were asked to cook a healthy food at home with help of their learned issues. Finally, the mothers expressed their opinions and experiences about cooking a healthy food, which positively affected their promotion of practice. The subjects in study group were also given a booklet and two educational researcher made pamphlets for indirect education. Two months after administration of educational program, the data related to subjects’ knowledge, attitudes (Health Belief Model dimensions), and practice were collected by the same questionnaire. The data were analysed by SPSS software version 18. Paired t-test and independent t-test were employed to compare studied variable mean scores before intervention and 2 months after in each group and mean scores differences at an identical time in two groups respectively. Mann-Whitney and independent t-test were utilized to compare women’s education in both groups and mean age of the subjects respectively.
