The main difference between the present study and other studies on hope-promoting therapy is that this study used only the Quranic theory of hope, contrary to the positive psychology theory used in other studies. The hope-promoting intervention used in this study was based on the purpose of human creation, was parallel to human evolution, and its foundation was based on the faith in God. Through this faith, such trust and confidence is achieved in the human psyche that he/she will become patient and resistant against all adversities of life and will not be disappointed. Moreover, the models used in this intervention to strengthen hope are the prophets of God, and have a grand position compared to the models existing in psychology. In general, patients’ need for communication with God is an innate need, and the establishment of true peace and the strengthening of real hope are possible only through a relationship with the creator (Raad 28/13). Interventions based on the religious beliefs of these patients can be very effective. Patients need to feel safe and supported, and, more importantly, hopeful during their illness more than at other times. In addition, an Islamic culture exists in Iran, and 98% of Muslims adhere to their religious orders and values and benefiting from the Quran and Islamic teachings has a special place among them. Therefore, religious practices can be used to create, maintain, and enhance hope, and thus, improve the patients’ QOL.
