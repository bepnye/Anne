Several trials with lipid-modifying therapy have included sufficient numbers of diabetics to indicate that treatment of diabetic dyslipidaemia with either fibrates or statins reduces the risk of future coronary events in such patients. However, until recently no reported study had been designed specifically to investigate the effects of intervening in patients with type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study (DAIS) is an angiographic study in which 418 diabetic subjects were randomized to micronised fenofibrate or placebo groups. After 3 years of treatment, the fenofibrate group had a significantly reduced rate of progression of coronary atherosclerosis. This study, when considered with the results of other studies that have included diabetics, has important implications for the treatment of diabetic dyslipidaemia. The evidence that is currently available supports a place for both fibrates and statins, either as monotherapy or in combination, in the treatment of diabetic dyslipidaemia.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>atherosclerosis</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>fenofibrate</kwd><kwd>fibrate</kwd><kwd>statin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title></title><p><offsets xml_i="3058" xml_f="3692" txt_i="1117" txt_f="1751">There is a worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes that is contributing to a disturbing increase in the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in many countries. The precise mechanisms by which type 2 diabetes causes CHD is uncertain, although the dyslipidaemia that is common in this form of diabetes almost certainly has a role. Indeed, several large-scale intervention studies with lipid-modifying therapy have included a sufficient number of type 2 diabetics to be able to conclude that, as in non-diabetics, treatment of the abnormal lipids in type 2 diabetes reduces future coronary risk.

Fenofibrate has been reported to decrease plasma triacylglycerol and increase HDL cholesterol and, in contrast with some other fibrates, also promotes a modest decrease in LDL cholesterol. It can therefore be argued that such an agent might be an appropriate therapy for type 2 diabetics. The results of DAIS add support to this view by clearly demonstrating a slowing of coronary atherosclerosis during 3 years of treatment with fenofibrate. The results are also most encouraging with regard to the possible outcomes in continuing, long-term, hard-endpoint trials using fenofibrate in type 2 diabetics.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9372" xml_f="9881" txt_i="6599" txt_f="7108">One of these is the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, in which more than 9000 type 2 diabetics have been randomised, double blind to placebo or micronised fenofibrate. This 5-year study in which the primary endpoint is coronary mortality is due to be completed in 2004/2005. The FIELD study will provide a clear answer to the role of fenofibrate in the prevention of CHD in diabetes. The results of DAIS greatly strengthen the justification for conducting the FIELD Study.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9903" xml_f="9965" txt_i="7110" txt_f="7172">Statins and fibrates in the treatment of diabetic dyslipiaemia</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9976" xml_f="10628" txt_i="7173" txt_f="7825">Considering the evidence from large-scale hard endpoint trials that have included diabetics, and the recent evidence from DAIS, it is apparent that treatment with both fibrates and statins has the capacity to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and to reduce the future incidence of coronary events. A question that frequently arises is: Should we use a statin or a fibrate as the agent of first choice to treat the dyslipidaemia in type 2 diabetes? On the basis of current evidence, it is difficult to give a categorical answer. However, it is possible to interpret the existing evidence as supporting a case for using each class of drug.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10635" xml_f="10779" txt_i="7826" txt_f="7970">There are two circumstances in which the choice of drug is reasonably clear.

However, there is a substantial group of type 2 diabetics in whom the levels of both plasma triacylglycerol and LDL cholesterol are higher than desirable and with low HDL cholesterol. Treatment with a statin will undoubtedly correct the LDL cholesterol but might leave the HDL low. Treatment with a fibrate might correct the HDL cholesterol/triacylglycerol abnormality but might be unable to lower LDL cholesterol to recommended target levels for diabetics. In such cases, many physicians will opt to use combination therapy with a statin and a fibrate. However, it should also be noted that there is still no long-term evidence on the safety or effectiveness of this combination. Therefore, as potentially serious adverse effects might occasionally occur when combining a fibrate and statin, this combination should be offered only to patients who are at high coronary risk.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="12027" xml_f="12046" txt_i="9122" txt_f="9141">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12057" xml_f="12071" txt_i="9142"
