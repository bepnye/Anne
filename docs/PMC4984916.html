All devices were placed using jugular veins for access with ultrasound guidance. The positioning of the Hickman catheters was confirmed by fluoroscopy or chest X-ray; fluoroscopy was routinely used to position the TIVAS. A standardised approach to catheter care was adopted, which included weekly heparin flush and dressing change for the Hickman catheters, and monthly heparin flush for TIVAS. Unlike the Hickman catheters, TIVASs were not in routine use at either of the two centres before the study.

In contrast with a totally implanted device, only one case of infection was observed. In the TIVAS arm, the most commonly reported complication was line occlusion (defined as inability to aspirate blood). The decision analytical model showed that, despite the lower device costs, taking into account complications, Hickman catheters were associated with greater costs, fewer complications averted, but similar QALYs compared with TIVAS.

In terms of recruitment, the recruitment rate was poor at the initial 12 months. However, this was resolved by introducing dedicated staff to act as ‘trial champion'. The champion interacted with the patient pathway at all the important stages and successfully engaged with both healthcare staff and patients. In term of assessing complication rates, the definitions of complications were clear, but further refinements to the definitions of mechanical complications and line occlusions would ensure more accurate classification and coding. For instance, line occlusion was the most frequently observed complications among patients with TIVAS. Further investigations found that on several occasions when nursing staff was not able to aspirate blood return, this was resolved by the medical staff successfully re-sitting the needle into the TIVAS. It is likely that several of these were misclassified as apparent ‘line occlusions'. Training is important with both these devices to minimise complications. At the start of this trial, a TIVAS user-training programme was instituted as these devices were not in regular use. Training and nurse confidence improved over the study period. This could be a potential confounder in future trials.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28640" xml_f="29941" txt_i="21226" txt_f="22527">There were also limitations to the economic evaluation. Healthcare resource use recorded in the TIVAS arm was surprisingly low, especially when compared with the Hickman arm. This may reflect potential performance bias; the two senior radiologists who were responsible for insertion of the TIVAS were often involved in resolving TIVAS complications. As a result, the costs associated with TIVAS may have been underestimated. On the other hand, the EuroQol 5D was used to estimate health utilities associated with using the two devices, and showed very small differences between the two arms. This may be explained by the results being dominated by the toxicity of the chemotherapy and disease status. The device-specific quality of life questionnaire in contrast appeared sensitive to differences between the two devices with 13 of the 16 questions showing statistically significant differences. The QALYs associated with TIVAS may have been underestimated. Due to the small sample size, correlation between the two questionnaires was not explored. The uncertainty associated with the QALY estimates was an important driver to the EVPI results. There is a clear need for more accurate estimates of QALYs, which supports the conclusion that further research to reduce overall uncertainty is worthwhile.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29948" xml_f="30337" txt_i="22528" txt_f="22917">This study suggests that the most expensive and least used device (TIVAS) may in fact be the most cost-effective.
