Many African countries have adopted combinations of drugs for first-line malaria treatment that include a compound based on the plant-derived molecule artemisinin. In Uganda, the artemisinin-based compound therapy (ACT) adopted as first-line therapy is artemether-lumefantrine (AL). However, there are limitations to the use of this drug; dosing is not convenient and it needs to be given with fatty food. There are also concerns that even though AL and other ACTs successfully treat the initial infection, there is a risk of malaria recurring soon after therapy, particularly in areas where mosquito attack rates are high. Therefore, the researchers here wanted to compare AL treatment with another ACT, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children who live in an area of Uganda where malaria is transmitted at a very high rate.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8827" xml_f="8828" txt_i="3089" txt_f="3090">

The children were randomly assigned to receive either AL tablets, given twice daily for 3 days, or DP tablets, given once daily for 3 days. The primary outcomes in the trial were the risks of clinical malaria recurring, and the risk of parasites reappearing in the blood but without any sign of clinical malaria, over 42 days of follow-up. The researchers also carried out tests to distinguish new malaria infections from a reappearance of the old infection.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9471" xml_f="10287" txt_i="3714" txt_f="4530">Overall, children who received DP treatment were less likely to have malaria parasites reappear in their blood than children who received AL treatment. Similarly, the risk of a recurrence of clinical malaria was lower in the DP arm than in the AL arm; 39% of patients treated with AL went on to develop malaria symptoms by 42 days whilst only 25% of patients treated with DP did. These findings were similar if the researchers only looked at children in whom the same infection reappeared, as opposed to those who experienced a completely new infection. There did not seem to be any differences between the study groups in overall rates of adverse events, most of which were mild or moderate in nature. The serious adverse events that occurred in this trial were not thought to be related to the drugs being studied.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10294" xml_f="10295" txt_i="4531" txt_f="4532">

A further strength is the follow-up period of 42 days, in line with recent World Health Organization guidelines for such trials. This trial included children aged under 10 years, whereas children aged under 5 years are generally considered most at risk from malaria. However, the majority of children in this trial were in the under-5 age group, and the overall results were similar when only considering children in this age range. Finally, one possible limitation is that blinding of participants may not have been complete in this trial: children and parents were not informed of their treatment assignment, but the study drugs were different in appearance.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11214" xml_f="11215" txt_i="5432" txt_f="5433">

Accurate distinction between recrudescent and new falciparum infections following therapy was challenging due to the complexity of infection in this high transmission setting, despite the use of 6-locus genotyping. However, DP clearly offered better post-treatment prophylactic effect following therapy compared to AL and our data suggest a reduced risk of treatment failure due to recrudescent parasites.

Even using six-locus genotyping, the probability of a new infection being misclassified as a recrudescence may be relatively high.
