This RCT had an estimated power of 56% to find differences in neonatal infections, and 61% power to detect puerperal infections. A higher rate of operative vaginal deliveries was found in the enema group, although it did not reach statistical significance. It is worth mentioning this, because operative vaginal deliveries may have an effect in puerperal infection rates. The use of an aggregated outcome helped to reduce sample size but it would have been ideal to have a sample size large enough to establish effects in newborns and puerperal women separately. Despite being practical, aggregating results has important limitations: if the maternal and neonatal outcomes have significantly different magnitudes or point out in different directions, aggregation will cancelled out or underestimate the differences.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25030" xml_f="25291" txt_i="20122" txt_f="20383">We didn't have resources to collect information to assess if the population of women admitted to the trial represented all eligible women.

A dramatically larger study would be necessary to determine the effects, if any, of enemas on specific outcomes including life-threatening complications. Enemas cause discomfort, increase workload for health carers and marginally increase the cost of health care. At this time there is no good evidence supporting the routine use of enemas. It seems unlikely that the effect of enemas on the incidence of specific outcomes is large enough to outweigh the inconvenience or adverse effects associated to the routine use of enemas during labour.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26957" xml_f="27135" txt_i="22001" txt_f="22179">The data from this study combined from additional RCTs may help better understand the particular effects of enemas, guide policies and elucidate the role of enemas during labour.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="27157" xml_f="27176" txt_i="22181" txt_f="22200">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27187" xml_f="27247" txt_i="22201" txt_f="22261">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="27269" xml_f="27291" txt_i="22263" txt_f="22285">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><bold><offsets xml_i="27308" xml_f="27328" txt_i="22286" txt_f="22306">Luis Gabriel Cuervo </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="27335" xml_f="27522" txt_i="22306" txt_f="22493">led the conception and design of the RCT, coordinated its implementation and development, data recollection, analysis and interpretation of data, and leads the writing of this manuscript.</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="27535" xml_f="27558" txt_i="22494" txt_f="22517">María del Pilar Bernal </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="27565" xml_f="27744" txt_i="22517" txt_f="22696">trained research assistants, collected and input data, helped with the day to day management, participated in the writing of this article, and has reviewed its different versions.</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="27757" xml_f="27773" txt_i="22697" txt_f="22713">Natalia Mendoza </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="27780" xml_f="27992" txt_i="22713" txt_f="22925">contributed to the development of data capturing templates, trained research assistants, collected and input data, and participated in the original writing of this article and has reviewed its different versions.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28014" xml_f="28037" txt_i="22927" txt_f="22950">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28048" xml_f="28112" txt_i="22951" txt_f="23015">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/6/8/prepub"></ext-link></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="28279" xml_f="28301" txt_i="23018" txt_f="23040">Supplementary Material</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="28383" xml_f="28400" txt_i="23041" txt_f="23058">Additional File 1</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28411" xml_f="28442" txt_i="23059" txt_f="23090">Participant flow and follow-up.</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="1471-2393-6-8-S1.jpeg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="28547" xml_f="28566" txt_i="23091" txt_f="23110">Click here for file</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S2"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="28687" xml_f="28704" txt_i="23111" txt_f="23128">Additional File 2</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28715" xml_f="28903" txt_i="23129" txt_f="23317">Characteristics of participants at admission.
