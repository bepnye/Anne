They could also request the mobile phone number of another trial participant so that they could text each other for support. By texting the word “lapse”, participants would receive a series of three text messages that encouraged them to continue with their quit attempt. Participants in the intervention group using pay-as-you-go mobile phone schemes were given a £20 top-up voucher to provide sufficient credit to participate in the intervention.

Cotinine has an in-vivo half-life of about 20 h, and can only be detected with a cotinine test for a few days after the use of tobacco. Carbon monoxide can be detected only for about 24 h after tobacco use. In any trial of a smoking cessation intervention, some participants could be embarrassed that they had not managed to stop smoking and might state they had stopped smoking. Such smokers then might stop smoking before providing a sample for testing. However, if a smoker wanted their cotinine test to record them as a non-smoker, they would first need to know how long to quit for in order for their saliva to test negative.
