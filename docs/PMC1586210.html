Secondary objectives are divided into surgical and non-surgical categories. In the surgical category there are the following points: total duration of operation (skin incision until suture), weight of specimen, amount of postoperative bleeding, frequency of reoperation due to bleeding, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (temporary or irreversible – pre- and postoperative assessment of vocal cord function by ENT-specialist), wound infection rate and rate of impaired parathyroid gland function. The non-surgical category consists of duration of postoperative hospital stay. To assess the relevance of the chosen endpoints, the following ten aspects have to be ranked from "most important" to "least important" by patients and surgeons (only once): Intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, voice function, dysphagia, death, postoperative pain, postoperative fatigue, convalescence of complete physical maximum resilience and cosmetic result [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"><offsets xml_i="19010" xml_f="19012" txt_i="12117" txt_f="12119">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19019" xml_f="19021" txt_i="12119" txt_f="12121">].</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19043" xml_f="19054" txt_i="12123" txt_f="12134">Sample size</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19065" xml_f="20170" txt_i="12135" txt_f="13240">A relevant difference between the two operations is defined as greater than 15 minutes. The expected difference is 20 minutes. Analysis of retrospective data showed a standard deviation of about 27 minutes for the whole operation. For the primary endpoint a percentage of 70% of the whole operation time is assumed. If this percentage were exactly 70% for every operation, standard deviation for the primary endpoint would be 0.7*27 min = 18.9 minutes. Since this relation will probably not be so strict, the standard deviation for the primary endpoint is estimated to be higher. Thus, a standard deviation of 20 minutes is assumed. The α level is set to 0.05; therefore, 200 patients per group are required to obtain a power of 80% (β = 0.2) using a simple one-sided t-test for two groups with a shifted null-hypothesis. Due to the fact that no interaction is expected regarding surgeon experience and treatment group, the sample size calculation is also valid for the ANOVA model of the primary analysis.

The second amendment was introduced to expand the inclusion criteria in regard to the type of operation. Until then, only hemi-thyroidectomies in combination with subtotal thyroid resection of the other side were included into the trial. Since this operation is not the only standard surgical procedure in goiter surgery in Germany, complete thyroidectomy and near-total thyroidectomy were added.

Due to the principles of Evidence-based Medicine (EbM), the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is assumed to be the gold standard in evaluating different medical methods and procedures. Even in RCTs, though, the risk of bias should not be underestimated. In surgical trials a double blinded trial design is difficult to establish; therefore, the patient selection, power, randomization, surgeon's skill, data assessment and documentation of outcome measures and statistical analyses are important design issues and susceptible to the different forms of bias. Hence, all these issues are specified in the trial protocol a priori.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26655" xml_f="27046" txt_i="19401" txt_f="19792">Selection bias. To minimize the selection bias all patients scheduled for thyroid surgery are screened consecutively in all participation sites.

Randomization is done in a block randomization system with alternating block sizes to avoid positive prediction of the last procedures in each block. The calculated randomization sequence is sealed at the IMBI for each participating center. Envelopes are nontransparent and cannot be resealed after opening.

Another source of bias is the surgeon's expertise. Most often new surgical techniques or methods are introduced by the most experienced surgeons. To minimize this source of bias stratification for surgeon's skill is made, and measured data will be analyzed by analysis of variance in regard to surgeon's skill, center and vessel occlusion technique. Due to this analysis of variance, bias of center effects and surgeon's skill should be reduced. Possible complications such as bleeding, re-operation due to bleeding, recurrent palsy or impaired function of parathyroid glands are assessed by blinded study nurses or investigators. Re-operation, recurrent palsy and impaired function of parathyroid glands are obvious events that can not be diminished by the responsible surgeon.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28380" xml_f="29002" txt_i="21108" txt_f="21730">Prevention of non-conclusive results.
