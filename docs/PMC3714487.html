We report in this paper a description of the time course of weight changes in the ACCORD trial, along with baseline characteristics and medications and changes in A1C that were associated with changes in body weight following institution of intensive glycemic therapy in participants with type 2 diabetes. No single factor was strongly associated with, and potentially responsible for, the change in weight in each group.

In contrast, when A1C was lower than 7.8% at baseline, a drop in A1C during treatment was associated with a decrease in weight in both arms. However, the degree of both A1C decline and weight loss in these participants was relatively small. Thus, in clinical practice, an attempt to intensify treatment in patients with a very high A1C is likely to lead to a significant weight gain. It is unclear whether the weight gain in such patients relates just to improvement in glycemia itself or greater use of insulin and TZD in patients who have higher baseline A1Cs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25222" xml_f="25716" txt_i="16767" txt_f="17258">We have presented results from &gt;90% of participants in the trial. At the time of discontinuation of the glycemic arm of the trial (and stopping intensive treatment), a large proportion of participants had not completed 3 years in the trial. Thus, although the data suggest some continued weight gain beyond 2 years, the number of participants decreases rapidly over the years. Due to the lack of power, none of the statistical tests used are appropriate for use beyond the 2-year time point.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25723" xml_f="26259" txt_i="17259" txt_f="17795">Some of the results are not surprising, particularly the associations of weight gain with high baseline A1C and insulin use subsequent to randomization. Similarly, the greatest gain in weight occurred in participants using combination of insulin and TZD during the trial. This combination was used more extensively in the intensive treatment arm of the trial. Those participants who used insulin at entry into the trial tended to gain more weight, perhaps due to substantial increases in their insulin dose and/or the addition of a TZD.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26266" xml_f="26494" txt_i="17796" txt_f="18024">Change in A1C during the trial did not predict weight gain uniformly, suggesting that it is possible to improve glycemic control without weight gain in some individuals, perhaps using appropriate strategies to change lifestyle (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="26525" xml_f="26526" txt_i="18024" txt_f="18025">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26533" xml_f="26534" txt_i="18025" txt_f="18026">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="26565" xml_f="26566" txt_i="18026" txt_f="18027">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26573" xml_f="27077" txt_i="18027" txt_f="18531">). Without adjustment for baseline A1C, a weight gain of 0.65 kg was associated with each 1% (absolute) reduction of A1C. However, assessment within treatment groups and by stratification according to the A1C at baseline showed in some circumstances either little change or a decrease in weight accompanying reductions of A1C. This may reflect the success of strategies to change lifestyle in some participants in the intensive arm, some of whom successfully lost weight while improving glycemic control.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27084" xml_f="28360" txt_i="18532" txt_f="19805">The medications taken at baseline and follow-up explain 6 and 14% of the variability in the weight change from baseline during the first year in the standard and intensive arms, respectively, and 10 and 12% of the variability in weight change during the second year, respectively. Of interest, during the first year of treatment, variability in the subjects' baseline medications and baseline A1C account for almost all (88%) of the change in weight in the intensive arm but less than half of the weight change in the standard arm. Overall, TZD use accounted for a much higher percent of variability in weight in the intensive than the standard arm. This difference may relate to a greater use of TZDs in the intensive compared with the standard arm. It should also be noted that the overall amount of variability explained by medication use after randomization was relatively modest, never accounting for &gt;15% of the variability in any of the models. However, in clinical practice, what matters most is the net effect on weight. Our data suggest that intensive therapy will probably cause weight gain (unless appropriate lifestyle interventions are instituted), and weight gain is likely to be maximal when the intensive therapy consists of a TZD-plus-insulin combination.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28367" xml_f="28827" txt_i="19806" txt_f="20266">Metformin use at baseline was associated with weight gain during the trial compared with those who did not enter the trial on metformin. This may relate to the known effect of metformin to decrease body weight, which may have already occurred with maximal effect prior to entry into the study.

In addition, insulin is known to be an anabolic hormone that also has some effects on weight regulation via the central nervous system, and TZDs have effects on adipogenesis.

All patients were advised regarding lifestyle changes according to American Diabetes Association guidelines, with varying degrees of compliance.

On multivariate analysis, younger age, male sex, Asian race, no smoking history, high A1C, BMI of 25–35, high waist circumference, insulin use, and metformin use at baseline were independently associated with weight gain over 2 years. Following randomization, the intensive group participants with the greatest reduction in A1C gained the most weight. Insulin and TZD use was associated with the greatest weight gain. However, all of these factors explain only a small proportion of the weight gain. Nevertheless, appreciation of these characteristics may help develop strategies to prevent weight gain when initiating intensive glycemic control in the future.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
