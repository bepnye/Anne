Participants will be randomized into one of four 24-week conditions: a cigarette substitute that does not produce an inhalable aerosol; or one of three ECIG conditions that differ by nicotine concentration 0, 8, or 36 mg/ml. Blocked randomization will be accomplished with a 1:1:1:1 ratio of condition assignments at each site. Specific aims are to: characterize ECIG influence on toxicants, biomarkers, health indicators, and disease risk; determine tobacco abstinence symptom and adverse event profile associated with real-world ECIG use; and examine the influence of ECIG use on conventional tobacco product use. Liquid nicotine concentration-related differences on these study outcomes are predicted.

Each cartomizer is individually filled by staff to ensure the strength of the nicotine concentration, the amount of liquid placed into each cartomizer, and how recently it was filled. The cigarette substitute is a plastic, patented tube that looks like a real cigarette and is designed to provide the same draw resistance as a smoker’s usual cigarette (QuitSmart, Inc., North Carolina, USA). The airflow is controlled by a porous plastic insert located inside the cigarette tube and by a small ventilation hole between the posterior end of the cigarette filter and the anterior end of the cigarette tube.

Non-compliance with study procedures (e.g., consistently missing visits, not maintaining their daily dairies, unable to use their study product for a period of more than two weeks not by choice) are grounds for PI-consultation and withdrawal. Furthermore, participants will also be withdrawn from the study if they present with serious clinical adverse events, pregnancy, recurring illness, a new illness that could adversely interact with study participation, or worsening substance abuse. Any hospitalization at any time during participation is also grounds for study withdrawal. Hospitalizations will be self-reported by the participant and will be reviewed by the site PI and medical professional to determine whether continued participation in the study is appropriate (e.g., recovery from a major surgery, worsening of psychiatric symptoms, etc.). Finally, if a participant is behaving in an inappropriate or threatening manner, admits to dishonesty about eligibility criteria, is participating in other smoking research studies that could affect the primary outcome measures, appears/admits to giving away/selling study products, consistently loses study products etc., then they may be withdrawn from the study at the PI’s discretion.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37453" xml_f="37705" txt_i="27843" txt_f="28095">Participants may also choose to remove themselves from the study by informing the research team in writing at any point during the study.

In response to this challenge, analytical and clinical laboratory testing were used to understand relevant ECIG device characteristics and nicotine delivery profile of the ECIG liquid nicotine concentrations chosen. The external analytic confirmation of nicotine content in all ECIG liquid used in the current RCT is also an important design characteristic and is in contrast to most clinical examinations of ECIG use [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16"><offsets xml_i="45510" xml_f="45512" txt_i="35429" txt_f="35431">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45519" xml_f="45521" txt_i="35431" txt_f="35433">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17"><offsets xml_i="45554" xml_f="45556" txt_i="35433" txt_f="35435">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45563" xml_f="46294" txt_i="35435" txt_f="36166">]. Prior knowledge of the liquid nicotine content and nicotine delivery capabilities of the device/liquid combination will strengthen the results obtained. Additionally, research staff at each site are responsible for filling individual cartomizers for this RCT. While more labor intensive, this procedural design detail allows for complete control and responsibility to ensure the integrity of liquid nicotine concentration in each participant’s cartomizers. As previously noted, we will test the liquid to confirm the nicotine concentration for additional safeguarding. We considered purchasing pre-loaded cartomizers, but decided the labor intensive approach was more appropriate given the importance of this element of the RCT.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46301" xml_f="47274" txt_i="36167" txt_f="37140">In terms of control condition selection, the use of both an ECIG containing 0 mg/ml in addition to a control condition where no ECIG aerosol or nicotine is delivered (cigarette substitute) also is an important strength of the current design. Importantly, as this RCT is not a smoking cessation treatment study and we are not recruiting individuals interested in smoking cessation, the treatment-related equipoise considerations required of most RCTs are less applicable here. We see the cigarette substitute condition as a vital comparator to understand how ECIG aerosol and ECIG-delivered nicotine may affect user health among our other primary aims. While we anticipate the possibility that those assigned to the cigarette substitute condition could be more likely to withdraw their participation, Visit 10 procedures (ECIG provision to individuals who were randomized to the cigarette substitute) are intended to reduce this likelihood following the intervention period.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47281" xml_f="47640" txt_i="37141" txt_f="37500">Another factor that needed to be considered when designing this protocol was the evaluation of side effects that ECIG users may experience.

In particular, there is not a universally agreed upon definition of an ECIG “use” within the literature and scientific community at this time. There are a number of mechanisms that can be used to measure cigarette and product use, such as daily text messages or the use of interactive voice response technologies. Daily diaries were chosen for this RCT due to the length of the intervention period and its complexity. In addition, the ECIG batteries included an automated puff counters on the ECIG which allowed for greater accuracy of use measurement. A related design challenge was the assessment of other tobacco product use and measures to assess ECIG use. There are few standardized measures of ECIG use [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52"><offsets xml_i="48837" xml_f="48839" txt_i="38618" txt_f="38620">52</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="48846" xml_f="49146" txt_i="38620" txt_f="38920">], thus assessments for both during the intervention and follow-up phase needed to be developed and adapted from other sources.

The act giving the FDA its authority over tobacco products makes clear that regulation should be based on verifiable, scientific evidence. This science-based regulation involves evaluating the health effects of a potential tobacco product, especially the effects that might be expected under real-world use conditions. However, there are few demonstrated methods for predicting effects in the real world. This issue is becoming more critical as novel tobacco products are proliferating and evolving and major tobacco companies are revealing the pivotal role that novel tobacco products such as ECIGs play in their future business endeavors. ECIGs represent an important product category to examine and results from this study will inform knowledge concerning their use as well as demonstrate how this model may be applied to other tobacco products.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CO</term><def><p>Carbon monoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECIG</term><def><p>Electronic cigarette</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNAL</term><def><p>4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNK</term><def><p>4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLFB</term><def><p>Timeline follow back</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>JF has done paid consulting for pharmaceutical companies involved in producing smoking cessation medications, including GSK, Pfizer, Novartis, J&amp;J, and Cypress Bioscience.
