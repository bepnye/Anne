The PW intervention consists of a stepwise process to identify and solve barriers for RTW, based on consensus between the sick-listed employee and his/her supervisor about a plan to facilitate RTW. Employees are first referred to an RTW coordinator (in most cases an ergonomist) by their OP. Then, the employee and supervisor identify barriers for RTW separately in structured conversations with the RTW coordinator, based on a task-analysis. In a third conversation the employee, the supervisor and the RTW coordinator brainstorm together to find solutions, resulting in a plan for RTW, based on consensus. One of the essential features of the protocol is that the RTW coordinator's role is predominantly that of guiding the process, not that of an occupational health (OH) professional who decides what is wrong and what should be done about it.

Compared with obstacles related to physical workload, the solutions for mental workload and stress were more often found in job content and work organisation.

Additionally, according to the supervisors RTW coordinators need to have knowledge about work activities in specific departments. Therefore, in this study an RTW coordinator had to be a company social worker or a labour expert. Because such professionals normally work for specific departments, all the professionals agreed that in order to ensure the independence of the intermediary position they should not be the RTW coordinator for their own department.

Achieving equality in the conversation is another prerequisite in the expertise of the RTW coordinator, which could possibly contribute to feelings of safety for the employees. The OH professionals agreed that every solution, even if it was suboptimal according to their expertise, is appropriate if the employee and the supervisor have agreed on it. However, the suggestion that RTW coordinators could participate in the brainstorming session to derive solutions from their expertise was supported by the employees and the supervisors alike.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="43163" xml_f="43240" txt_i="31135" txt_f="31212">Preconditions needed for an employee before starting with the PW-intervention</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="43251" xml_f="43542" txt_i="31213" txt_f="31504">The right moment to apply the PW intervention is considered to be very important.

Finally, one practical restriction could be the lack of availability of an RTW coordinator and a supervisor in planning the conversations concerning the PW intervention.

The original protocol was adapted in several ways. First, the process-guiding abilities of the RTW coordinator were considered to be most important, but it was thought that some expertise in the field of SMDs was also necessary to avoid including counter-effective solutions to be included in an RTW plan. Secondly, the OP is given the opportunity to plan additional consultations before starting the PW intervention in the fourth week of sick leave. These consultations allow more attention to be paid to stress reduction techniques before starting the protocol. Thirdly, employees will be asked by their OP to fill in an inventory of stressors. It is important that stressors in the work area as well as other areas need to be specified as explicitly as possible. The employee also has to indicate the extent to which each stressor can be influenced because this will increase the employee's input in the discussions. Furthermore, the OPs are responsible for explaining the PW intervention to supervisors and asking them to participate. The OP will explain that talking about RTW in this protocol does not mean that RTW must start immediately, and that the PW intervention does not increase the complaints (based on evidence). And finally, employees can begin or continue with other treatment, if needed. The OPs explain to the employees and the supervisors that the initial RTW could be supportive, even if the complaints are still present. The OPs will send a letter about the PW intervention and a communication form to the employee's general practitioner to prevent resistance to the protocol and conflicting advice about RTW.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T5"><label><offsets xml_i="49056" xml_f="49063" txt_i="36764" txt_f="36771">Table 5</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="49083" xml_f="49123" txt_i="36771" txt_f="36811">The Participatory Workplace intervention</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="49208" xml_f="49212" txt_i="36812" txt_f="36816">Step</offsets></bold></td><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="49247" xml_f="49254" txt_i="36817" txt_f="36824">Content</offsets></bold></td><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="49289" xml_f="49305" txt_i="36825" txt_f="36841">Who is involved?</offsets></bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="49358" xml_f="49387" txt_i="36842" txt_f="36871">1.

Frequently summarising the perspectives of the employee and/or the supervisor will allow them both to reformulate their perspectives. The consensus procedure will provide solutions supported by both the employee and the supervisor, and it is important that work activities are experienced as meaningful by the employee. In addition to this, the actions need to be clearly formulated in the RTW plan. Explicit arrangements about who is responsible for each solution and the period of time that it will take to implement a solution are recorded, and the anticipation of certain problems will be included in the protocol. For instance, when resistance is expected from co-workers, the supervisor can plan a meeting to explain about the PW intervention process and any possible changes. The RTW coordinator will write a report describing the barriers identified by the employee and the supervisor, selected solutions, and arrangements made in the plan for RTW. This report will be sent to the employee, the supervisor and the OP.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="52920" xml_f="52971" txt_i="39600" txt_f="39651">Step 4 – Design an adoption and implementation plan</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="52982" xml_f="53188" txt_i="39652" txt_f="39858">Adequate time, appropriate intensity of the PW intervention and sufficient resources, as well as the provision of suitable materials and training opportunities, are essential for successful implementation [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="53220" xml_f="53222" txt_i="39858" txt_f="39860">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="53229" xml_f="53563" txt_i="39860" txt_f="40194">].
