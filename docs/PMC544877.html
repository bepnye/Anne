A number of trials that investigated the effects of home visits show positive results, but others do not. The outcomes can depend on differences in characteristics of the intervention programme, but also on the selection of the target population. A risk group approach seems promising, but further evidence is needed. We decided to carry out a study to investigate the effects in a population of elderly with (perceived) poor health rather than the general population. Also, we test whether nurses who are qualified at a lower professional level (home nurses instead of public health nurses) are able to obtain convincing effects. The results of this study will contribute to the discussion on effective public health strategies for the aged.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4344" xml_f="4358" txt_i="942" txt_f="956">Methods/design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4369" xml_f="5453" txt_i="957" txt_f="2041">The study is carried out as a parallel group randomised trial.

In the last two decades, preventive programmes have been developed aiming at reducing health care cost and improving the independent functioning of elderly people. One of such programmes is home visitation by public health nurses of elderly people living in the community. This aims to maintain or improve the functional abilities and well-being of elderly people and reduce the use of institutional care services. Such programmes for elderly people are part of national policy in several countries, including the UK, Denmark and Australia.

Therefore, we decided to carry out a new trial in which the risk group approach is tested in a larger population of those with (perceived) poor health.

We also hypothesize that they will reduce specialist care, institutionalisation, especially hospital (re-) admissions, and total health care expenditures.

Persons on a waiting list for admission to nursing homes or homes for the elderly were also excluded. The local independent committee dealing with applications for the use of care services already granted them this service. It is likely that most of them already receive regular supervision of professional caregivers. Six persons were excluded on the advice of their GPs.

The home nurses are not part of a multidisciplinary team, but advice can be obtained from in-home specialists within the home care organisation, e.g., a dietician, a diabetes specialist and an occupational therapist. A nurse geriatric specialist from the local hospital can also be consulted, if necessary.
