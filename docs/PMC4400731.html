suturing following childbirth. For those women whose perineal wound dehisces, the
management will vary according to individual practitioner's preferences.
For most women, the wound will be managed expectantly (healing by secondary
intention), whereas others may be offered resuturing. However, there is limited
scientific evidence and no clear guidelines to inform best practice. PREVIEW is a
two-part study aiming to identify the best management strategy for dehisced
perineal wounds, in terms of clinical effectiveness and women's

dyspareunia and women's satisfaction with the aesthetic results of the

is based on retrospective audit or case reviews and tends to include small numbers of
participants hence is subject to bias. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of
women reporting perineal infections and dehiscence in the community is increasing;
however, systems to track these complications following hospital discharge are lacking.
It is vital that a true estimate of the problem is established using standardised
definitions of wound infection and at the same time determine best practice when
treating dehisced perineal wounds. It is apparent that perineal wound dehiscence both
locally and worldwide has not been a high priority either in practice or in research,
and therefore, management is not based on robust evidence. Due to the lack of
evidence-based guidelines, clinical practice varies widely between individual
practitioners and institutions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10247" xml_f="10333" txt_i="4856" txt_f="4942">Perineal wound dehiscence, which is commonly reported to be associated with

for the primary outcome of interest. One of the purposes of this pilot study is to
collect data to inform a sample size calculation for a full-scale RCT. Three
aspects of informing this calculation are to estimate (1) the recruitment rate,
(2) attrition rate and (3) the proportion of women whose wound had healed at
6–8 weeks (the primary outcome). Hence, in estimating the sample
size of this pilot study, we attempted to ensure a sufficient degree of precision
of these estimates (precision defined as twice the SE).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23599" xml_f="24731" txt_i="16161" txt_f="17293">A retrospective study at the host research site has identified that there were 117
women referred to the perineal care clinic with a dehisced perineal wound during a
4-year period (30 women/year). Hence, we estimate that there will be around 45
eligible women for recruitment per participating centre. Assuming that 45 women
will be eligible per centre, with a take up rate of 80% and an attrition rate of
20% in four participating centres, we expect to recruit 144 women and 116 (58 in
each arm) of these to complete the pilot study. This would allow for the
recruitment rate in each site to be estimated with precision of ±12% (based
on n=45), and overall recruitment rate to be estimated with precision
±6% (based on n=180). Loss to follow-up would be estimated with
precision ±7% (based on n=144), and healing at
6–8 weeks (assumed to be around 50% from the retrospective study
mentioned above) would be estimated to ±13% in each trial arm (based on
n=58 per arm). Although the sample size is quite large for a pilot study,
we feel that this is necessary in order for recruitment to start bedding down in
each of multiple sites.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24738" xml_f="25466" txt_i="17294" txt_f="18022">Estimating effect size is not a specific aim of this pilot, but nevertheless, it

6–8 weeks and that realistic percentages in the secondary resuturing
group will be between 10% and 90%, the effect size for the primary outcome will be
estimated with a precision of between ±15% and ±18%. This will be
fed into deliberations regarding plausible effect sizes to be used for future
sample size calculations. It is worth noting that with this sample size, the study
will have 90% power to detect an increase in healing from 50% to 80% (assuming a
5% two-sided significance level).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25473" xml_f="25741" txt_i="18023" txt_f="18291">As the definitive trial is likely to require many centres in order to meet sample

variable (since randomisation was stratified by site). Precision of estimates of
effect size (ORs) will be summarised using 95% CIs. The analysis plan for other
outcomes will also be developed taking into account the type and distribution of
data (eg, logistic regression, multiple regression). If the amount of missing data
seems problematic (eg, over 20%), we will assess the robustness of the results by
data imputation in tandem with best- and worst-case sensitivity analyses. In
addition to looking at each time point separately, we will also test a repeated
measures approach to analysis to try and gain insight to whether effect sizes are
changing over the course of follow-up (ie, looking at the interaction between
intervention group and time). It is anticipated that this will be implemented
using a multilevel (mixed) model for binomial or continuous responses as
