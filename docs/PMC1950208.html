A major strength of this study was that, although transmission intensity varied over the course of follow-up, both cohorts were similarly exposed to malaria. The incidence of clinical malaria in children receiving placebo fell gradually during the first 4 y of life, reflecting the natural development of immunity to uncomplicated clinical disease. However, the documented rate of immunity acquisition was slower than expected given the moderate-to-high transmission rate that had been estimated in the area. This may be partly explained by the fact that the study population had prompt access to diagnosis and treatment, which may delay the development of immunity [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0040242-b018" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34081" xml_f="34083" txt_i="22752" txt_f="22754">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34090" xml_f="34091" txt_i="22754" txt_f="22755">,</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0040242-b019" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34137" xml_f="34139" txt_i="22755" txt_f="22757">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34146" xml_f="34460" txt_i="22757" txt_f="23071">].

However, the reduction in these endpoints decreased with increasing age, approaching zero towards the end of the first year of life. The cause of this trend is unknown. Compliance did not decrease, and it is unlikely that drug resistance would develop in such a short timeframe. It is possible that the use of a standard recommended dose during the prophylaxis period, which was unlinked to a dose per weight of the child, resulted in sub-therapeutic drug concentrations in older children. A hypothetical reduction with age in the synergy between declining maternally transferred immunity and a moderately efficacious drug may also contribute to the loss of drug efficacy during the first months of infancy. However, the loss in efficacy was also apparent in the latter months of infancy when transplacentally transferred antibodies are not expected to remain [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0040242-b021" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="35769" xml_f="35771" txt_i="24215" txt_f="24217">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35778" xml_f="35780" txt_i="24217" txt_f="24219">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35787" xml_f="35904" txt_i="24220" txt_f="24337">During the entire follow-up period, the difference in deaths was not statistically significant (19 versus 13 deaths, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="35912" xml_f="35913" txt_i="24337" txt_f="24338">p</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="35922" xml_f="36028" txt_i="24338" txt_f="24444"> = 0.512).

Secondly, it appears that children who start building immunity after the age of 1 y do so at a slower rate than those who start in infancy, explaining the long duration of the rebound. This difference may, in part, be a reflection of the decreasing EIR in the area. However, it is unlikely to be the main factor involved, as it would imply a rapid change in the transmission intensity that would have been reflected by a rapid drop in the malaria incidence in children receiving placebo—and this did not occur.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37237" xml_f="38020" txt_i="25518" txt_f="26301">Thirdly, the results could be interpreted as suggesting that the benefits of chemoprophylaxis in infancy may be negated by the overall slight increase in the number of malaria episodes in the early years of life. The end of chemoprophylaxis was followed by an immediate increase in the incidence of febrile malaria, well beyond the incidence in placebo recipients—a so-called rebound effect. This increased risk continued for at least 18 mo and was large enough that, by the age of 2 y, the cohorts had experienced a similar number of febrile malaria episodes.

Our data do not support this conclusion, but instead suggest that a delayed acquisition of immunity may lead to a small, but not significant, increase in the cumulative number of malaria episodes and, importantly, to a lower CR of severe malaria. A similar pattern was observed for severe anaemia, which is the other major life-threatening complication of malaria in young children. In summary, shifting the age pattern of disease to older age groups does not markedly affect the overall number of mild uncomplicated febrile episodes or lead to an increase in severe malaria, and it is associated with an overall decreased CR of severe anaemia.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38860" xml_f="39260" txt_i="26969" txt_f="27369">Finally, the data provide insight into the effects of age on the clinical manifestations of infection. The observed reduction in the CR of severe anaemia in the intervention group provides a strong indication that malarial anaemia is dependent on the age at which infection takes place: children aged less than 1 y had a higher rate of anaemia than older children, as described by previous research [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0040242-b005" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="39306" xml_f="39307" txt_i="27369" txt_f="27370">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39314" xml_f="39907" txt_i="27370" txt_f="27963">]. Furthermore, it appears that this rate is not solely a function of acquired immunity or level of endemicity, but must be related to an age-dependent pathophysiological mechanism. Similarly, the CR of severe malaria was slightly lower in those children who had been previously chemosuppressed. Our data indicate that the risk of progressing from a mild to a severe episode of malaria or anaemia is greater in infants than in older children—a finding that has not been documented previously. Thus, delaying immunity acquisition does not appear to translate into increases in disease severity.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39914" xml_f="40696" txt_i="27964" txt_f="28746">These results show that reducing exposure early in life in a very major way, such as through continuous prophylaxis, can slow down the development of clinical immunity and can lead to a rebound in the risk of disease. However, shifting the age pattern of disease may lead to an overall slightly increased cumulative rate of uncomplicated malaria which was not associated with an increase in severe malaria or severe anaemia. The rebound induced by continuous prophylaxis at this early age has not been documented in other exposure-reduction interventions such as insecticide-treated bednets or when administering two or three treatment doses of anti-malarials at routine immunization contacts during the first year of life (intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants) [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0040242-b026" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="40742" xml_f="40744" txt_i="28746" txt_f="28748">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40751" xml_f="40988" txt_i="28748" txt_f="28985">].
