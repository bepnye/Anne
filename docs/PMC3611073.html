However, there was no hypotension or bradycardia at all on the group of patients maintaining a sitting position for two minutes, but three patients from the group taking a supine position required an injection of ephedrine and atropine. Even if there was no significant difference in both groups, if a sympathetic nerve block from spinal anesthesia caused hypotension, it might increase a chance of inefficient compensation, unlike young patients since the deterioration of function on autonomic nervous system differs by individuals.

In spinal anesthesia, on the elderly patients, an effort should be exerted to avoid unnecessary increase of a level of anesthesia and to secure the safety. Hereupon, in anesthesia on the elderly patients in a clinical environment, it is feasible to adjust the height of block in an appropriate level for surgery by controlling the time of maintaining a sitting position after injecting low dose local anesthetics and these results was helpful to maintain perioperative hemodynamic stability of patients.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This paper was supported by Konkuk University in 2009.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation
