Subjects from this phone list had been excluded from a previous study because they a) reported that they would not remain in the region for 3 years (n = 10), b) reported a recent history of anxiety, depression or bipolar disorder (n = 5), or c) reported past, but not current use of Bupropion (n = 4). Inclusion criteria required subjects to be 18 or over and smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day. No exclusion criteria were used, though incidentally no subjects used NRT or Bupropion during the study. Twenty-two potential subjects attended a one-hour orientation describing the intensive nature and time requirements of the intervention. Of these, 18 subjects signed the consent form and attended the first class. The other four excluded themselves after the orientation, reporting "scheduling" or "transportation" constraints.

As a smoking intervention, there were some differences from a typical MBSR course: subjects entered the intervention with the express purpose of smoking cessation; a quit date was provided, addiction questionnaires and carbon monoxide testing was performed at each weekly meeting, and course instructions were focused at times on how one might apply mindfulness to craving and withdrawal symptoms. In the spirit of non-goal-directedness central to mindfulness training, subjects were encouraged not to focus on smoking cessation as a "goal" for the intervention, but instead, to direct their intention toward developing a mindful orientation toward their lives. Subjects were encouraged to apply moment-to-moment non-judgmental awareness to strong emotions or thoughts, which in this case often involved craving, negative affect, or withdrawal symptoms. Subjects were encouraged to practice mindfulness throughout their day, including during meals, social interactions, and moments associated with situational drug use threats. The quit-smoking day was on the 7-hour "day of mindfulness", ten days prior to the end of the intervention. Considerable testing was performed at the final meeting.

It is noteworthy that ten of the thirteen subjects who attempted to quit (did not drop out) achieved abstinence at six weeks. The best explanation for this may be that MBSR is an intensive intervention and that due to its intensive nature, dropout rates are high but success rates in those who complete the intervention is also high. Although there were considerable limitations to this pilot study, this relatively high abstinence rate suggests that mindfulness training may have some promise as an intervention for smoking cessation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21988" xml_f="22060" txt_i="16288" txt_f="16360">4.2.

The point-prevalent 6-week abstinence rate was 100% among highly compliant meditators, 40% among moderately compliant meditators and 0% among non-compliant meditators (dropouts). One conclusion from this data would be that compliance with meditation is a trait of smokers who are motivated to quit and that meditation itself does not confer a therapeutic effect. Results from baseline questionnaires on motivation to quit smoking, however, do not support this: all subjects reported a "high-level of motivation" to quit smoking. Even if meditation time did co-vary with motivation to quit, the association between meditation time and smoking abstinence makes it difficult to dismiss the possibility that meditation provided some effect over and above motivation alone.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22964" xml_f="23031" txt_i="17234" txt_f="17301">4.3.

A decrease in stress in highly compliant meditators after quitting smoking is not a typical finding for smoking cessation interventions and suggests that meditation may exert an effect on outcomes though stress reduction. Another finding in the study was that highly compliant compared to non-compliant meditators demonstrated a drop in SCL-90-R scores. The difference, however, was confounded in this small sample by a large variance and did not reach statistical significance. As such, it is unclear from these study results whether compliance with meditation in this sample is associated with decreased affective distress.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="25105" xml_f="25127" txt_i="19285" txt_f="19307">4.6.

Pharmacotherapy was purposefully excluded from the study so as to allow for the appraisal of mindfulness training as a smoking intervention without the confounding therapeutic effects of medication. Limitations of the study also include a small sample size, absence of a control group and short-term follow-up. Since this was a pilot study aimed at assessing feasibility, pre-post study design was used and comparisons were made post-hoc based on compliance with meditation practice. Additionally, the program orientation, which discouraged four individuals from participating, may have introduced a selection bias that would lead to an overestimation of the intervention efficacy in other populations. Subsequent testing of mindfulness training as a smoking intervention would include the use of pharmacotherapy, random assignment of smokers to the intervention vs. control group, and six-month follow-up.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26161" xml_f="26175" txt_i="20311" txt_f="20325">4.7.

Notably, recruitment flyers advertised only a "quit smoking study" with no mention of meditation and no subjects were excluded based on motivation.
