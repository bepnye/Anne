Lower intensities are accepted if the patient cannot comfortably reach the maximal device intensity and will be noted on diary logs. There are controls for intensity and frequency, which the patient manipulates according to specific instructions and tolerances. Patients in this arm will be required to reach near maximal intensity on low frequency. The maximal intensity may, in rare cases, induce transient muscular contractions.

There is no quality evidence that subtherapeutic electrical current provides any clinical benefit over no electrotherapy effectiveness for LBP, however this will likely blind the patients because none of them have ever experienced the H-Wave Device. Blinding of patients is achieved as none will have previously experienced H-Wave, home based TENS therapy, or subtherapeutic electrotherapy.

Monitoring for safety will be conducted throughout the study, investigating all possible unanticipated safety events, including increased pain and discomfort which are the two most likely types of events to occur. These treatments are widely used and are considered safe with low rates of adverse effects. Efforts will be made to minimize the rates of missing data, including telephone follow-up of missed visits.

Therefore, even small improvements in treatment efficacy, particularly for treatments with few side effects, can have a meaningful impact on improving LBP. While there have been some studies assessing the therapeutic effectiveness of TENS, the effect generally is relatively small improvements in chronic LBP as compared to sham treatment. The use of two comparison arms in this study, both TENS and sham treatment, allows for comparisons of experimental device with both TENS as well as sham treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41275" xml_f="42125" txt_i="33215" txt_f="34065">Blinding within this study is a significant strength. All devices are identical in appearance, weight, display, charge time, and sound. It is anticipated that complete blinding of the assessors and patients will be achieved. Care will be taken to limit contact between participants, e.g. schedule participants one at a time so they are not waiting in the same room together. All treatment questions will be directed to the interventionalists, as to maintain blinding of the assessors. Additionally, this protocol outlines concealing the treatment allocation by using opaque envelopes that appear identical. The utilization of a complex randomization schedule is another strength that may ensure equality of treatment groups at baseline. The intent-to-treat analysis may account for unequal dropout between groups and any contamination that may occur.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42132" xml_f="42884" txt_i="34066" txt_f="34818">Potential weaknesses include the possibility of high dropout in one or more treatment arm. To combat this, we are offering incentives and encouraging participants to continue for the entire duration of the study. There is the possibility of a randomization failure, which cannot be overcome. Additionally, due to the nature of the treatment, specifically the differences between the experimental treatment and the TENS treatment, it was not feasible to blind the interventionalist. To address this all interventionalists will undergo strict training and re-standardization based on the treatment protocol. This training will stress treating all patients similarly with regards to demeanor and contact time, regardless of their randomized treatment arm.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="42906" xml_f="42914" txt_i="34820" txt_f="34828">Endnotes</offsets></title><p><sup><offsets xml_i="42930" xml_f="42931" txt_i="34829" txt_f="34830">a</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="42937" xml_f="43338" txt_i="34830" txt_f="35228"> Based on the ACOEM criteria, this study protocol is intended to provide a high-quality score (Randomization – 1, Blinded Allocation – 1, Baseline Comparability – 1, Patient blinding – 1, Interventionist blinding – 0, Assessor Blinding – 1, Control of co-interventions – 0.5, Compliance – 1.0, Drop Out &lt; 20% – 1, Timing of assessments – 1, ITT analysis – 1 (Total score 9.5/11) High-quality ≥ 8.0.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="43360" xml_f="43379" txt_i="35230" txt_f="35249">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="43390" xml_f="43451" txt_i="35250" txt_f="35311">The authors declare they do not have any competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="43473" xml_f="43495" txt_i="35313" txt_f="35335">Authors’ contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="43506" xml_f="43676" txt_i="35336" txt_f="35506">All listed authors contributed to the conception and design of the study.
