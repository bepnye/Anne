In a survey of secondary preventive care of 1,600 patients, from 35 randomly selected general practices in the west of Ireland, results were as follows: 23% of patients were regular smokers, 45% had cholesterol readings greater than 5 mmol/l and 34% had blood pressure readings greater than 140/90 mmHg. In addition, GP records were found to be incomplete, with 38% of patients with no record of smoking status and 25% with no cholesterol reading. Information from Northern Ireland suggests a similar situation: a recent survey found that among patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CHD 18% smoked, 25% had a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30,

The review also concluded that multi-faceted interventions may be more effective than single interventions, as more barriers to change can be addressed. The authors of the review recommend that future research should analyse barriers to change and report interventions to implement preventive services in more detail, to clarify how interventions relate to specific barriers. Since such complex interventions are likely to be more costly than single interventions, these reviewers also advise that economic evaluations should be included in future studies.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15949" xml_f="17194" txt_i="9607" txt_f="10852">The SPHERE Study aims to take these recommendations on board in developing an intervention to improve secondary prevention of CHD in general practice in Ireland. The SPHERE study involves the implementation of a structured systematic programme of care for patients with CHD attending general practice. The SPHERE intervention is multi-faceted and has been developed to respond to the barriers and solutions to optimal secondary prevention identified in preliminary qualitative research with practitioners and patients. The delivery of the intervention is tailored as much as possible to the needs of practices and patients. The process of the intervention will be documented and described in sufficient detail to allow replication of the intervention and to enable identification of effective intervention components. The intervention will be implemented over a 24 month period, with data collection at baseline, 12 months and 24 months. Data collection at these time points will enable identification of any initial and/or sustained changes effected by the intervention. An economic evaluation of the intervention will be carried out. The implementation of the intervention will be monitored throughout the duration of the trial and documented.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17201" xml_f="17310" txt_i="10853" txt_f="10962">In summary, SPHERE will add to what is already known in respect of secondary prevention in primary care, i.e.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17317" xml_f="17527" txt_i="10963" txt_f="11173">â¢ that structured programmes, with continued support and follow-up of patients, help improve recording of process measures of preventive care, patients' functional status, quality of life and lifestyle change [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="17558" xml_f="17559" txt_i="11173" txt_f="11174">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17566" xml_f="17567" txt_i="11174" txt_f="11175">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="17599" xml_f="17601" txt_i="11175" txt_f="11177">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17608" xml_f="17609" txt_i="11177" txt_f="11178">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="17641" xml_f="17643" txt_i="11178" txt_f="11180">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17650" xml_f="17651" txt_i="11180" txt_f="11181">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"><offsets xml_i="17683" xml_f="17685" txt_i="11181" txt_f="11183">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17692" xml_f="17693" txt_i="11183" txt_f="11184">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"><offsets xml_i="17725" xml_f="17727" txt_i="11184" txt_f="11186">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17734" xml_f="17736" txt_i="11186" txt_f="11188">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17743" xml_f="17845" txt_i="11189" txt_f="11291">â¢ prompts to patients improve their attendance but there is no associated change in measures of risk [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><offsets xml_i="17877" xml_f="17879" txt_i="11291" txt_f="11293">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17886" xml_f="17887" txt_i="11293" txt_f="11294">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="17919" xml_f="17921" txt_i="11294" txt_f="11296">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17928" xml_f="17930" txt_i="11296" txt_f="11298">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17937" xml_f="18062" txt_i="11299" txt_f="11424">â¢ structured recall programmes which do not take account of individual practice needs improve recording but not prescribing [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="18094" xml_f="18096" txt_i="11424" txt_f="11426">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18103" xml_f="18260" txt_i="11426" txt_f="11583">];

The two systems differ with respect to, for example, funding and organisational structures yet experience similar problems such as waiting lists and staff shortages. Using this framework, the policy analysis will begin by detailing and critically appraising the context, nature and distribution of heart disease in each system as well as the consequential policies and service responses. The analysis of documentary material and secondary data will be supplemented with interviews with key 'stakeholders' in the policy process. This part of the policy analysis will lead to, among other things, the identification and specification of policy goals and evaluative criteria as well as an account of the way in which the research programme will provide a 'test' and progress marker of policy objectives and policy implementation. The next step in accomplishing a thorough policy analysis is to describe and evaluate how the policy in the form of the proposed secondary prevention services in each system benefits the previously established criteria. The experimental, quantitative data relating to outcomes together with the conceptual, qualitative data about organisational and implementation processes plus the results of the economic appraisal will be analysed in an integrative way so as to evaluate and compare comprehensively the policies in each system â at least at a micro-level. This incremental, step-by-step approach plus the iterative nature of the analytical process are important because they improve the chances of producing a rigorous, context sensitive policy analysis.
