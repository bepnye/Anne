It has been proposed that to diagnose recurrent RI (RRI) at least one of the following criteria has to be present: 1) &gt;6 RI per annum, 2) &gt;1 RI per month involving the upper airways from September to April, 3) &gt;3 RI per annum involving the lower airways (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9"><offsets xml_i="5348" xml_f="5420" txt_i="1476" txt_f="1548">Gruppo di Studio di Immunologia della società Italiana di Pediatria 1988</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5427" xml_f="5679" txt_i="1548" txt_f="1800">). Moreover, RRI represent a social problem both concerning economic aspects and the influence on the family and social milieu of the child.

In recent years, following the increase in the incidence of antibiotic resistance, interest in preventive treatment has intensified. Such treatment should contribute to the prevention of RRI, thus reducing the usage and excessive consumption of antibiotics. Furthermore, it has been established that the intestinal microflora plays an important role in the maturation of the immune system (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11"><offsets xml_i="6161" xml_f="6176" txt_i="2212" txt_f="2227">Holt et al 1997</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6183" xml_f="6185" txt_i="2227" txt_f="2229">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6192" xml_f="6757" txt_i="2230" txt_f="2795">Probiotics are vital bacteria that colonize the intestine and modify its microflora with benefits for the host. They are present in foodstuffs such as yogurt and other dairy products. To exert their beneficial effects, probiotics must be able to overcome the obstacle of gastric acidity, to proliferate and to colonize the intestine even in the presence of biliary acids and of drugs such as antibiotics. They must adhere to intestinal walls, reducing their permeability and potentiate the local immune response, especially through secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12"><offsets xml_i="6789" xml_f="6808" txt_i="2795" txt_f="2814">Isolauri et al 2001</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6815" xml_f="6817" txt_i="2814" txt_f="2816">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6824" xml_f="6960" txt_i="2817" txt_f="2953">Probiotics are not pathogens as they are not virulent and consequently, their intake is usually not associated with undesirable effects.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6967" xml_f="8000" txt_i="2954" txt_f="3987">The beneficial effect of probiotics is also to be ascribed to its capacity to modulate the immune response. The immune response dependent on Th1 lymphocytes (Th1) deputy to defend from viruses and bacteria is not fully efficient because it has not completely matured. Whereas, the Th2 response to antigens prevails and is often enhanced due to contact with environmental allergens, resulting in early activation of allergic responses (type I IgE-mediated allergic responses). Probiotics are able to induce an antigenic stimulation that leads to release of interleukin (IL) 12 by antigen-presenting cells (APC), which promotes the maturation of the immune system and the Th1 response. Furthermore, they reduce the production of IL4, which specifically regulates the development of the Th2 phenotype and leads to an increase in the synthesis of IgE, eosinophilia and atopic disease. Probiotics have anti-inflammatory properties related to the stimulation of secretory IgA synthesis in mucous membranes and the production of cytokines (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10"><offsets xml_i="8032" xml_f="8051" txt_i="3987" txt_f="4006">Hattakka et al 2001</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8058" xml_f="8202" txt_i="4006" txt_f="4150">).
