The disease is caused by a single-celled parasite that is transmitted to people when they are bitten by an infected Tsetse fly. If the initial phase of the disease is not recognized and treated, the parasite infects the brain, resulting in confusion, sleep problems, and ultimately coma and death. Few treatment options exist, and the most commonly used drug, melarsoprol, is highly toxic; furthermore, parasites are evolving resistance to it in some regions. There is an urgent need to develop new drugs and to evaluate combinations of existing drugs for activity against African trypanosomiasis. Therefore a group of researchers from Epicentre, Médecins Sans Frontières, and the National Sleeping Sickness Control Programme in Uganda performed a trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of three drug combinations. The combinations compared were melarsoprol-nifurtimox, melarsoprol-eflornithine, and nifurtimox-eflornithine, and the researchers planned to recruit 435 people with second-stage African trypanosomiasis in Uganda who would be followed up for 24 months. The primary outcome for the trial was cure rate following treatment. However, once 54 patients had been recruited into the trial, it was obvious that the death rate was much higher among individuals receiving melarsoprol-nifurtimox; the trial was therefore stopped for ethical reasons and this paper reports the results obtained up to that point.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8350" xml_f="8351" txt_i="3615" txt_f="3616">

Although the number of participants recruited into the trial was much lower than originally planned, the differences in cure rates between nifurtimox-eflornithine and the other two treatments were statistically significant. Deaths and serious adverse events were much more common among patients receiving melarsoprol-nifurtimox than the other two combination therapies.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8956" xml_f="8957" txt_i="4202" txt_f="4203">

A high proportion of individuals recruited into the trial were followed up for the full two years, and the primary outcome of the trial—the cure rate—was appropriate. A key limitation of the study is that the trial was terminated early; therefore, the differences in efficacy observed in this trial should not be seen as definitive.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9532" xml_f="9533" txt_i="4759" txt_f="4760">

M+N deaths were caused by acute reactive encephalopathy: given the nature of this risk (a sudden-onset, highly fatal event that, once it has occurred cannot be mitigated by treatment interruption and patient withdrawal), there was no other choice but to interrupt the trial. Enrollment was not resumed and was definitively terminated in March 2002, when Uganda changed its regional first-line treatment from melarsoprol to the less-toxic eflornithine, further compromising the ethical justification for continuing a trial using treatments that are more toxic than the new routine therapy.
