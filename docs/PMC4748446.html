However, in general patients did not experience a long lasting reduction of fatigue from the CBT or ET. Mainly patients of the CBT, but also some patients of the ET described an increase of self-esteem and self-acceptance. As a result, patients were sometimes better able to perform physical activities during the day. In contrast to the CBT, the ET was in general perceived by the patients as an intensive therapy, which was difficult to fit into their daily routine. Therapists of both the CBT and the ET struggled with a low intrinsic motivation of the patients in the study. This made it sometimes difficult for the therapists to follow the protocol.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5539" xml_f="5549" txt_i="1550" txt_f="1560">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5560" xml_f="5992" txt_i="1561" txt_f="1993">Confirming the negative quantitative study outcome, the qualitative results did not demonstrate lasting effects on fatigue.

All psychologists highlighted that most patients did not experience specific distress from the fatigue, nor had they needs for support at the beginning of the CBT. The fact that patients had high pre-intervention scores on the CIS fatigue questionnaire did not by definition imply a feeling of distress (quote 19).

However, some positive effects, on physical as well as mental level, were indicated by the patients. They experienced an increased self-esteem and self-acceptance, less sleeping during day-time and better ability to distribute their energy over the day. The main downside of the ET was that it was demanding and time consuming and therefore difficult to fit into the daily routine of patients. In contrast to the ET, patients did not report negative experiences about the CBT. Therapists experienced a low intrinsic motivation of the participants of the ET as well as the CBT, possibly due to a low experienced distress; patients mainly participated for scientific reasons rather than personal needs. This made the interventions more difficult to apply and sometimes led to small adjustments in the use of the protocol. Despite the low intrinsic motivation, therapists of the ET as well as CBT felt the intervention was useful to teach patients how to exercise and how to divide their energy during the day.

Therefore, both types of research gain in principle different kinds of information, which can lead to different outcomes. Former studies also show that differences between interviews and self-reported questionnaires can occur, even when both methods address the same concepts.

The results of this qualitative study, however, add to this knowledge by giving insight in other experienced effects of the trial, form the perception of the patients as well as therapists. This study showed that some patients of the CBT and ET did experience an increase in self-esteem and acceptance of their disease and associated disabilities, and short term enhanced endurance and better use of energy during the day. This suggests that both interventions are potentially useful for patients with PPS. Besides, the study gained insight in what aspects of the interventions were experienced as difficult to the patients and therapists. In contrast to the CBT, the ET was in general experienced as a very intensive therapy, which was difficult to fit into the daily routine for the patients and sometimes difficult to execute for the therapists. To increase the feasibility of the training, the frequency and intensity of the training should fit the possibilities of the participants. The CBT can be valuable, provided that patients have an intrinsic motivation for the therapy. This motivation was lacked by most patients in this trial, which could at least partly explain the results of the quantitative study.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec29"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="Sec30"><title>Topic lists</title><sec id="Sec31"><title>Topic list patients CBT and ET prior to the therapy</title><p>Opening<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Introducing ourselves</p></list-item><list-item><p>Aim of the project</p></list-item><list-item><p>Aim and estimated durance of the interview</p></list-item><list-item><p>Consent about audio tape and member check</p></list-item></list></p><p>General information<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Can you tell me something about your diagnosis (what is it, since when)</p></list-item><list-item><p>How old are you?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is your educational level?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is your family situation?
