Before anesthesia induction, initial core temperature was measured with a tympanic thermometer (Thermoscan IRT 4020, Braun, Kronberg, Germany). An esophageal stethoscope was inserted after induction of anesthesia for the intraoperative monitoring of core temperature. After initial monitoring, the patients were covered with a surgical drape.

Further studies to verify such hypothesis such as an evaluation of autonomic nervous functions, a direct measurement of hemodynamic parameters such as SVR, and blood flow measuring by Doppler ultrasound should be conducted. Second, we assumed the equivalent anesthetic depth has accomplished according to the BIS monitoring during anesthesia. However, it is difficult to find out equally effective anesthetic concentrations that produce equal BIS values when different anesthetics with different mechanisms are used. Third, a BIS range between 40 and 60 is wide enough to influence the anesthetic concentrations. Although we tightly monitored the BIS score and vital signs and adjusted the concentrations of anesthetic (desflurane, 6.0 ± 1.0 vol%; Ce of propofol, 3.0 ± 0.5 µg/ml; Ce of remifentanil, 2.5 ± 2.0 ng/ml), the possibility that thermoregulatory response has been influenced by a subtle distinction of anesthetic concentration cannot be excluded.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25927" xml_f="26689" txt_i="18530" txt_f="19292">Our study was conducted to compare the effects on the thermoregulatory responses in patients with tympanoplasty according to the anesthetic techniques such as inhalation anesthesia with desflurane and TIVA with PEEP application.
