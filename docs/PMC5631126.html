Humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity (CMI) were assessed. The co-primary immunogenicity objectives were to evaluate HZ/su vaccine response rate and compare the immune response to HZ/su and placebo in participants excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHBCL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) at 1 month post-dose 2 (M2). Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded for 7 and 30 days after each dose, respectively. Serious AEs (SAEs), disease-related events and potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) were recorded throughout the study. Partial safety results up to 6 months post-dose 2 are shown (partially blinded, ongoing study).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s3"><title><offsets xml_i="4717" xml_f="4724" txt_i="1452" txt_f="1459">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4735" xml_f="5327" txt_i="1460" txt_f="2052">Of 562 participants (283 HZ/su 283; placebo 279), (mean age 57.3 [HZ/su 56.8; placebo 57.8] years), 415 were included in the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for humoral immunogenicity and 132 in the ATP sub-cohort for CMI. M2 immune responses were higher in the HZ/su group (Table 1). Both co-primary immunogenicity objectives were met (Figure 1). The most frequent local and general solicited AEs were pain and fatigue, reported by 48.2% and 47.8% of all participants (per-group data remain blinded). The frequency of unsolicited AEs, SAEs and pIMDs in the 2 groups was similar (Table 2).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s4"><title><offsets xml_i="5357" xml_f="5367" txt_i="2054" txt_f="2064">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5378" xml_f="5578" txt_i="2065" txt_f="2265">HZ/su induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses at M2 in HM adults excluding NHBCL and CLL, who completed or are undergoing ICT.
