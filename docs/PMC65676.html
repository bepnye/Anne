The collection of resource use data is a prerequisite for these evaluations. There are essentially three ways to collect resource use data. Data can be collected from clinicians, patients and routine medical records. A drawback of collecting data from clinicians, through clinical proforma or case report, is that they cannot be blinded to patient participation in the study, increasing the chance of introducing a biased assessment of outcome. Disadvantages of collecting data from medical records include: access to the relevant medical records may be difficult particularly if treatment is spread over a number of different providers; the high cost in terms of research time to access such records; the accuracy of some data collection systems may be questionable; finally, some resource use data such as time off work, or over the counter medicines, may not be available from medical records.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6217" xml_f="6952" txt_i="2461" txt_f="3196">The alternative of asking the patient for their resource use is attractive, as relevant questions can be readily included within patient self completed questionnaires. Consequently such a method is easier and less costly form of data collection compared with medical records. The disadvantages to using patient completed questionnaires, both prospective and retrospective, concern their accuracy. The accuracy of self completed questionnaires is affected by recall error, item completion rates and questionnaire response rates. Hence, patients may report inaccurate levels of resource use, they may not complete the relevant resource use questions consistently if at all and finally, some patients will not return their questionnaires.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6959" xml_f="7204" txt_i="3197" txt_f="3442">There has been some previously published work looking at the accuracy of patient reported resource use data, but the results have been somewhat contradictory.

The largest proportion of physiotherapy referrals was expected to be carried out at the orthopaedic unit in which the trial was taking place. We therefore planned to use the hospital physiotherapy department's records to provide estimates of resource use with patient reports supplementing hospital records (for example, if a patient had received physiotherapy from a distant facility). However, once the study was underway we found that the hospital physiotherapy department's system of record keeping using physiotherapist diaries, meant that individual patient data were difficult and time consuming to access. We also found that more patients than expected were being referred to physiotherapists in the community, at health centres or to other hospitals. In total patients were referred to 31 different centres for their physiotherapy which meant much of this data was impossible to access due to the logistical and financial constraints of the study. We did, however, succeed in obtaining hospital data for a sample of patients, and this gave us the opportunity to compare the agreement of patient and hospital reported data for the estimation of total resource use. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to compare the results of retrospective patient self-reported physiotherapy use with routinely collected hospital record data.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="10278" xml_f="10285" txt_i="6036" txt_f="6043">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10296" xml_f="10647" txt_i="6044" txt_f="6395">Patients included in the study were all over 18 years and had all been referred to their local orthopaedic hospital with a musculoskeletal condition, which was classified by existing hospital procedures as unlikely to require surgery.

In addition, we have also shown that differences in estimates of the number of physiotherapy sessions attended can occur when patient self-reported data and hospital records are compared. In this instance, even for patients for whom hospital and self-report agreed that physiotherapy treatment had taken place we cannot be sure that PDR data represents the more reliable measure as there is some doubt as to whether all the physiotherapy data were either recorded at all or recorded in such a form that it was easily accessible to the researcher. This might explain the discrepancy between the two methods. It is also possible that recall problems led patients to report additional visits outside the reference period of three months.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18402" xml_f="19049" txt_i="12662" txt_f="13309">However, even if the hospital estimates of the number of physiotherapy visits per patient were more accurate, the use of patient reported data is not likely to bias the results of our evaluation unless there were systematic differences between the trial groups in terms of accuracy. In the table there is some evidence that this could be happening, with patients allocated to OM reporting on average one extra visit per patient when compared with the OS group. It would be prudent, if necessary, to undertake a sensitivity analysis using both estimates to ensure that the two data sources do not lead to different estimates of physiotherapy costs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19056" xml_f="19396" txt_i="13310" txt_f="13650">Whilst the differences between the two methods of data collection are statistically significant, they may not be of economic significance.
