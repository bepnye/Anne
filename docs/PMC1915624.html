That is, although the LC–NE system projects to multiple brain areas, including many known to be involved in spatial attention, the diffuse character of these projections is inconsistent with the direct biasing of attention in any specific direction (i.e., the LC does not “know” the relevant spatial location). To test these two hypotheses, we contrasted, in human subjects, the effects of a noradrenergic drug on measures of temporal and spatial attention. Most previous studies examining the functional significance of the LC–NE system have employed drugs acting on α2 receptors. In this study, we used the α2 adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, which at low doses decreases LC firing and attenuates the release of NE from axon terminals (Svensson et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35"><offsets xml_i="9292" xml_f="9296" txt_i="5103" txt_f="5107">1975</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9303" xml_f="9305" txt_i="5107" txt_f="5109">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9312" xml_f="10013" txt_i="5110" txt_f="5811">Previous studies have examined the effects of clonidine on temporal and spatial attention in a visuospatial cueing task. In this task, subjects are required to respond as quickly as possible to a series of stimuli presented to the left or right of fixation. Each stimulus is preceded by a cue indicating at which location the imperative stimulus is most likely to appear, and subjects are instructed to make use of this information by switching their attention to the location indicated by the cue. The comparison of reaction times on validly versus invalidly cued trials (the “validity effect”) provides an index of the efficiency of cue-induced spatial attention shifts.

However, it is hard to interpret clonidine-related reductions in the validity effect, because they may reflect either a direct involvement of the noradrenergic system in spatial attention processes or an interaction between the alerting and attention-directing (i.e., spatial) effects of cues. Specifically, by increasing the responsivity of cortical representations after cue presentation, LC-induced phasic NE release can enhance the effects of target selection by location (e.g., the top-down modulation by prefrontal cortex), resulting in an increased validity effect. The effects of this amplification mechanism would be diminished by clonidine.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11811" xml_f="12159" txt_i="7358" txt_f="7706">In contrast to previous studies, we used separate tasks for measuring the effects of clonidine on temporal and spatial attention: an attentional blink task, which requires the selection of targets in time and has no spatial component, and a visual search task, which requires the selection of targets in space but without the help of alerting cues.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12166" xml_f="12459" txt_i="7707" txt_f="8000">In the attentional blink task, each trial starts with a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream containing two target stimuli (T1 and T2) and multiple distractors, each presented for about 100 ms.

The theory was inspired by the observation that the timing of the attentional blink coincides with the refractory period in LC activity that follows an LC phasic response to target stimuli. Specifically, although NE potentiates processing in cortical areas, local NE release within the LC is autoinhibitory because of the noradrenergic action at presynaptic and dendritic α2 autoreceptors (Aghajanian et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1"><offsets xml_i="14071" xml_f="14075" txt_i="9329" txt_f="9333">1977</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14082" xml_f="14848" txt_i="9333" txt_f="10099">). This autoinhibition results in a period after the LC phasic response (∼200–450 ms after the eliciting stimulus), during which subsequent LC phasic discharge is rarely observed. According to the theory, the attentional blink may be mediated by this momentary unavailability of the LC phasic response (and attendant noradrenergic potentiation of information processing) after the LC response to T1. In other words, if T2 is presented during the LC refractory period associated with T1, it will not receive the benefit of NE-mediated facilitation and is therefore more likely to remain unidentified. A computational model implementing this theory was shown to accurately simulate the time course of the attentional blink, including lag-1 sparing (Nieuwenhuis et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27"><offsets xml_i="14881" xml_f="14886" txt_i="10099" txt_f="10104">2005b</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14893" xml_f="15120" txt_i="10104" txt_f="10331">).

On each trial, subjects searched for a target among multiple distractors in a visual search array and indicated as quickly as possible whether the target was present or absent. The number of distractors (i.e., set size) was systematically varied across trials. In one condition (single-feature search), the target was defined by a salient basic feature, such that search was efficient and the number of distractors had little influence on reaction times. In another condition (conjunction search), the target was defined by a conjunction of two features, such that search was inefficient, and reaction times increased linearly with the number of distractors—as if each item needed to be examined in turn.

Stimuli were presented in black against a light grey background. Each trial started with a fixation cross measuring 0.5 × 0.5°, presented for 1,000 ms in the center of the display. Subsequently, the fixation cross was replaced by an RSVP stream of 15–22 uppercase letters, each measuring approximately 0.9 × 0.9°. Each letter was randomly drawn (without replacement) from the alphabet and presented for 50 ms, followed by a 30-ms blank interval. This relatively rapid pace of stimulus presentation (i.e., 80 ms between two consecutive stimulus onsets) was chosen to avoid ceiling levels of performance and consequently to increase the sensitivity of the task to individual and group differences. “I,” “O,” “Q,” and “S” were left out as they resemble digits too much. On each trial, two of the letters were replaced with digits, randomly drawn without replacement from the set 2 to 9. T2 was presented three to six temporal positions from the end of the stream. The temporal distance between T1 and T2 was systematically varied from one to five items, corresponding to lags of 80, 160, 240, 320, and 400 ms. The subject’s task was to identify both T1 and T2 by typing the digits in order on a standard keyboard after the end of the RSVP stream. Subjects were instructed to guess whenever they failed to identify a digit. The two keyboard entries were followed by the presentation of a feedback stimulus for 150 ms (e.g., ‘+, −’ to indicate that T1 was correct and T2 was incorrect). After a 1,000-ms blank screen, the next trial started. Each subject started with 15 practice trials, three with each condition, randomly intermixed. This was followed by four blocks of 50 trials each with each block containing ten repetitions of each lag.

First, in contrast to our predictions, clonidine did not have a deleterious effect on attentional blink performance. Although the numerical group differences in T1 and T2 accuracy were in the expected direction, these differences were small compared to the sizeable performance differences between the individuals within each group (for a discussion of these individual differences, see Martens et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25"><offsets xml_i="34003" xml_f="34007" txt_i="26528" txt_f="26532">2006</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34014" xml_f="34303" txt_i="26532" txt_f="26821">).

One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that the predicted group differences do in fact exist, but that our task and experimental design were not sufficiently sensitive to reveal them. Some critical factors in this regard may be the choice of a between-subject design and the sample size of 16 subjects per group. However, previous studies using between-subject designs, similar group sizes, the same subject population, and the same task have had no difficulty detecting group-levels effect on attentional blink performance of various manipulations aimed at distracting subjects from the RSVP stream (Olivers and Nieuwenhuis </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28"><offsets xml_i="35641" xml_f="35645" txt_i="28001" txt_f="28005">2005</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35652" xml_f="35654" txt_i="28005" txt_f="28007">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29"><offsets xml_i="35687" xml_f="35691" txt_i="28007" txt_f="28011">2006</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35698" xml_f="36154" txt_i="28011" txt_f="28467">). Indeed, our choice of design was based on these previous studies and on the assumption that the effect of clonidine would be of at least the same size as the effect of these behavioral manipulations. In this context, it is worth noting that the interindividual variance in attentional blink performance was comparable to that in the Olivers and Nieuwenhuis studies, discounting increased variance as a reason for our failure to detect group differences.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36161" xml_f="36358" txt_i="28468" txt_f="28665">A more principled reason for the use of a between-subject design was that subjects can learn to adopt a ‘mental state’ that greatly benefits attentional blink performance (Olivers and Nieuwenhuis  </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29"><offsets xml_i="36391" xml_f="36395" txt_i="28665" txt_f="28669">2006</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36402" xml_f="36566" txt_i="28669" txt_f="28833">), and we wanted to avoid the transfer of such learning between drug conditions to exclude a potential contaminating source of variance.

Second, our task-block comparisons show that, if anything, the group difference in attentional blink performance became smaller over time, a trend opposite from that expected if the effects of clonidine needed more time to develop. A third and related argument is that we found no significant interaction between group and task order, corroborating the notion that group effects did not become larger over time. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that group effects peaked earlier than our test period.

Thus, our methods and results do not seem to contain any clear indication that the observed null effects reflect a lack of sensitivity. However, it is of course possible that a higher drug dose would yield more robust group differences. This is a possibility that can be addressed in future research (note that such research should take into account that the primary mode of action of clonidine changes with increasing dose; (Arnsten and Cai </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2"><offsets xml_i="38959" xml_f="38963" txt_i="30897" txt_f="30901">1993</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38970" xml_f="39274" txt_i="30901" txt_f="31205">). At low doses, presynaptic receptors and LC receptors are stimulated, leading to a reduced NE activity. In contrast, at higher doses, postsynaptic receptors are activated, resulting in a boost of NE activity. This has important implications for the expected effects of clonidine on cognitive function).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39281" xml_f="39546" txt_i="31206" txt_f="31471">Another possible explanation for the absence of significant drug effects on attentional blink performance is that the attentional blink may not be mediated by the LC–NE system. This possibility would be particularly bothersome for the theory of Nieuwenhuis et al. (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27"><offsets xml_i="39579" xml_f="39584" txt_i="31471" txt_f="31476">2005b</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39591" xml_f="40246" txt_i="31476" txt_f="32131">), which directly relates the attentional blink to a refractory period in activity of the LC–NE system. Although there is substantial indirect evidence in support of this theory (e.g., the relationship between the attentional blink and the P3), the basic tenets of the theory are based on cell recordings in animals and are hard to validate directly in humans. Indeed, the current study is perhaps the most direct test to date of a relationship between the attentional blink and the LC–NE system. In this context, it is important to note that another research group has reported preliminary evidence consistent with such a relationship (De Martino et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18"><offsets xml_i="40279" xml_f="40283" txt_i="32131" txt_f="32135">2005</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40290" xml_f="40585" txt_i="32135" txt_f="32430">). This study, using a between-subject design, found that attentional blink performance was significantly impaired after intake of the ß-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (40-mg oral dose compared to placebo).

A further avenue for future research will be to test and evaluate the effects of noradrenergic drugs on temporal attention using alternative experimental paradigms, such as the temporal analogue of the spatial cueing paradigm (Posner et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32"><offsets xml_i="41180" xml_f="41184" txt_i="32912" txt_f="32916">1980</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41191" xml_f="41209" txt_i="32916" txt_f="32934">; Coull and Nobre </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13"><offsets xml_i="41242" xml_f="41246" txt_i="32934" txt_f="32938">1998</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41253" xml_f="41272" txt_i="32938" txt_f="32957">; see Coull et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16"><offsets xml_i="41305" xml_f="41309" txt_i="32957" txt_f="32961">2001</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41316" xml_f="41485" txt_i="32961" txt_f="33130">).

Previous studies using visuospatial cueing tasks have found that clonidine reduces the cue validity effect (Clark et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9"><offsets xml_i="42184" xml_f="42188" txt_i="33774" txt_f="33778">1989</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42195" xml_f="42210" txt_i="33778" txt_f="33793">; Coull et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16"><offsets xml_i="42243" xml_f="42247" txt_i="33793" txt_f="33797">2001</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42254" xml_f="42527" txt_i="33797" txt_f="34070">), which has led to the suggestion that the LC–NE system is directly involved in visuospatial orienting. For example, it has been proposed that the LC–NE system plays an important role in the disengagement of visuospatial attention from invalidly cued spaces (Clark et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9"><offsets xml_i="42559" xml_f="42563" txt_i="34070" txt_f="34074">1989</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42570" xml_f="42592" txt_i="34074" txt_f="34096">; Posner and Petersen </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31"><offsets xml_i="42625" xml_f="42629" txt_i="34096" txt_f="34100">1990</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42636" xml_f="43371" txt_i="34100" txt_f="34835">). This proposal is consistent with the little available evidence, which suggests that the reduced validity effect after clonidine administration is mainly due to attenuated performance costs on invalidly cued trials. However, we propose an alternative interpretation for these results to reconcile them with our theoretical framework. According to our interpretation, the presentation of the cue causes a spatially nonspecific, transient LC–NE response that boosts the processing of any stimuli presented for a brief period thereafter (i.e., the alerting effect). Although not supported by the current attentional blink findings, this assumption is based on various sources of evidence in the animal literature (Aston-Jones and Cohen </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"><offsets xml_i="43403" xml_f="43407" txt_i="34835" txt_f="34839">2005</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43414" xml_f="43435" txt_i="34839" txt_f="34860">; Witte and Marrocco </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38"><offsets xml_i="43468" xml_f="43472" txt_i="34860" txt_f="34864">1997</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43479" xml_f="44421" txt_i="34864" txt_f="35806">). The cue-induced LC–NE response speeds up cortical spatial selection processes involved in localizing the cue and/or subsequent imperative stimulus. This improves performance on validly cued trials and impairs performance on invalidly cued trials thus increasing the validity effect. Administration of clonidine counteracts this amplifying effect of phasic LC–NE activity thereby reducing the validity effect (note that this hypothesis predicts both improved performance on invalid trials and impaired performance on valid trials). This type of interaction between the alerting effect and spatial selection processes is absent in the visual search task, which has no clear alerting component. Therefore, the current results are consistent with the notion that the LC–NE system is not directly involved in visuospatial orienting but can only indirectly modulate the effects of spatial attention mechanisms implemented elsewhere in the brain.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44428" xml_f="45047" txt_i="35807" txt_f="36426">One drawback of the current study is that we did not include a task that has already been shown to be sensitive to clonidine in previous studies. Therefore, a possible interpretation of the reported null findings is that the administered dose of clonidine failed to affect general cognitive function in our subjects, and that the main effect of drug on visual search RT reflects drug-induced motor slowing rather than a central cognitive deficit. Although we deem this possibility unlikely, given that previous studies using similar doses of clonidine have found significant effects on cognitive function (Coull et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16"><offsets xml_i="45080" xml_f="45084" txt_i="36426" txt_f="36430">2001</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45091" xml_f="45108" txt_i="36430" txt_f="36447">; Tiplady et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37"><offsets xml_i="45141" xml_f="45145" txt_i="36447" txt_f="36451">2005</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45152" xml_f="45248" txt_i="36451" txt_f="36547">), a more extensive study with a larger task battery is needed to adequately address this issue.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45255" xml_f="45372" txt_i="36548" txt_f="36665">There is rapidly growing interest in the specific role of the LC–NE system in human cognition (Cohen and Aston-Jones </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11"><offsets xml_i="45405" xml_f="45409" txt_i="36665" txt_f="36669">2005</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45416" xml_f="45646" txt_i="36669" txt_f="36899">).
