Integrative health coaching (IHC) is designed to be a systematic, collaborative, and solution-focused process that facilitates the enhancement of life experience and goal attainment regarding health, but little research is available to describe the mechanisms through which empowerment occurs in the health coaching process. The purpose of this qualitative study is to describe apparent key components of the empowerment process as it actually occurs in IHC. A sample of 69 recorded health coaching sessions was drawn from 12 participants enrolled in a randomized controlled study comparing two different methods of weight-loss maintenance. Two researchers coded the word-for-word transcripts of sessions focusing on the structure of the sessions and communication strategies used by the coaches. Three basic sections of a coaching session were identified, and two main themes emerged from the communication strategies used: Exploring Participant's Experience and Active Interventions. In IHC, health coaches do not direct with prefabricated education based on the patient's presenting problem; rather, they use a concordant style of communication. The major tenets of the health coaching process are patient-centeredness and patient control focused around patient-originated health goals that guide the work within a supportive coaching partnership. As the field of health coaching continues to define itself, an important ongoing question involves how the structure of the provider-patient interaction is informed by the role of the healthcare provider (eg, nurse, therapist, coach) and in turn shapes the empowerment process.</offsets></p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="zh"><title>摘要</title><p>新兴的医疗服务模型表明，参与 自身护理对患者有益。综合健康 辅导 (IHC) 是一个系统化、协作 性、且专注于解决方案的流程， 它有利于提升生活体验和实现健 康目标，但鲜有研究对健康辅导 流程中产生赋能的机制进行说 明。本定性研究旨在说明 IHC 中 实际发生的赋能流程的明显关键 组成部分。从登记一项比较两种 不同的减重保持方法的随机对照 研究的 12 名参与者中抽取一份 载有 69 次健康辅导疗程记录的 样本。两名研究人员对疗程的文 字记录进行编码，关注疗程结构 和教练采取的沟通策略。确定了 辅导疗程的三个基本部分，找出 了所采取的沟通策略的两大主 题：探索参与者的经历和积极干 预方法。IHC 健康教练不会根据 患者表现出来的问题进行预先准 备的教育，相反，他们采用协调 的沟通方式。健康辅导流程的主 要宗旨是以患者为中心以及专注 于患者自发的健康目标的患者控 制，该宗旨通过支持性的辅导合 作关系指导工作。随着健康辅导 领域不断更新，医疗服务提供者 （例如护士、治疗师、教练）的 角色如何建立医患互动结构并反 过来形成赋能流程，成为一直存 在的重要问题。</p></trans-abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="es"><title>SINOPSIS</title><p>Los modelos emergentes en cuanto a la prestación de atención sanitaria indican que los pacientes se benefician de la participación en su propio cuidado. La formación sanitaria integral (FSI) está diseñada para ser un proceso sistemático, colaborativo y centrado en la búsqueda de soluciones que facilite la mejora de la experiencia vital y la consecución de objetivos relacionados con la salud, pero existen escasas investigaciones para describir los mecanismos a través de los cuales se produce la capacitación en el proceso de la formación sanitaria. La finalidad de este estudio cualitativo consiste en describir los componentes claves aparentes del proceso de capacitación tal como se produce realmente en la FSI. Se obtuvo una muestra de 69 sesiones grabadas de formación sanitaria de 12 participantes inscritos en un estudio controlado aleatorizado para comparar dos métodos distintos de mantenimiento de la pérdida de peso. Dos investigadores codificaron las transcripciones literales de las sesiones centrándose en la estructura de las sesiones y en las estrategias de comunicación empleadas por los monitores. Se detectaron tres secciones básicas dentro de una sesión de formación y surgieron dos temas a partir de las estrategias de comunicación empleadas: la exploración de la experiencia del paciente y las intervenciones activas. En la FSI, los monitores de formación no dirigen con una enseñanza prefabricada basada en el problema que presenta el paciente sino que adoptan un estilo de comunicación concordante. Los principios básicos del proceso de formación sanitaria consisten en centrarse en el paciente y en el control de este con la mirada puesta en las metas de la salud originadas en el paciente que guían el trabajo dentro de una alianza de formación de apoyo. A medida que se va definiendo cada vez más el campo de la formación sanitaria, existe una cuestión permanente importante que gira en torno a cómo la estructura de la interacción entre el profesional y el paciente se ve influida por el papel del profesional sanitario (p. ej., enfermero, terapeuta, monitor) y da forma a su vez al proceso de capacitación.</p></trans-abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Health coaching</kwd><kwd>lifestyle behaviors</kwd><kwd>chronic disease</kwd><kwd>qualitative methodology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Disclosures</bold> The authors completed the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest and disclosed no relevant conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8133" xml_f="8145" txt_i="1747" txt_f="1759">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8156" xml_f="8324" txt_i="1760" txt_f="1928">Lifestyle behaviors are considered the primary contributors to the chronic illness that underlies the collapsing infrastructure and economy of the US healthcare system.</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="8329" xml_f="8332" txt_i="1928" txt_f="1931">1-9</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="8338" xml_f="8816" txt_i="1931" txt_f="2409"> Lifestyle behavior not only influences the development of these chronic conditions but also affects their progression and severity through treatment nonadherence.

Initial coding of the communication strategies used by the health coaches identified 23 different strategies. These strategy codes were examined for possible overlap and consolidated into two themes: (1) Exploring Participant's Experience and (2) Active Interventions. Two of the strategies (Setting Immediate Goals and Scheduling Next Call) functioned together as the final step in the structure for the sessions.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22839" xml_f="22861" txt_i="14867" txt_f="14889">Structure of a Session</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22872" xml_f="24659" txt_i="14890" txt_f="16677">The coaching sessions generally followed a consistent structure that involved three basic sections. First, there was usually a brief check-in to see how things were going in general for the participant. Second, the coach discussed with the participant the progress he or she was making toward previously set goals. This section also included discussion of barriers to meeting the goals and how to overcome these barriers. Finally, participants set goals with their coaches based on their previous discussion and set an appointment time for the next coaching session. Expectation of the next appointment encouraged accountability on the client's part to follow through on the goals set in the session. Domains for goal-setting included the following: (1) food intake goals involving discussion of nutrition-related topics such as adequate protein intake or eating specific food groups; (2) eating process goals involving topics such as the speed at which the participant was eating or eating as a result of emotionally based cues rather than hunger based cues; (3) exercise goals involving topics related to the timing and type of exercise; (4) mindfulness goals involving incorporation of the mindfulness strategies and approaches learned in the group sessions; (5) participant-initiated discussion of target weight goals; and (6) health-related goals involving discussions of topics such as attendance at healthcare appointments or the need for additional stress management tools to address health concerns of the participants. The first sessions were slightly different than subsequent sessions because they included an orientation to the coaching process, and the last sessions were slightly different because they included questions asking for feedback on the entire EMPOWER program.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24666" xml_f="25208" txt_i="16678" txt_f="17220">The individual coaching calls were approximately 30 minutes each every other week starting during the ninth week of a group intervention and continuing for 6 months.

The process was patient-directed with the goal setting based on the patient's ideas, experiences, and choices. Coaches often asked participants for their goals using an open-ended question such as, “What do you want your plan to be for the next couple of weeks?” Occasionally the coach would ask the participant to recall goals previously set rather than stating goals for the participant as a way of communicating the participant's control over the process. Coaches were also nonjudgmental and refrained from evaluating the patient's choices whether or not he or she had met the goals set.

This is a very important distinction that is not well appreciated yet in common practice.

The amount of turn-taking also supports how patient-centric the coaching process is: The number of times the patient spoke was slightly greater, but roughly equivalent to how often the health coach spoke.

The coach-patient relationship is specifically centered on the patient's health goals and supporting the patient in those goals, whereas functions in a therapist-patient or a medical provider–patient relationship are far more numerous and diffuse. The professional role drives the structure of the interaction, and the structure created in health coaching allows for a focus on these patient-centered goals within a supportive environment/relationship. The structure reinforces the practices and techniques employed. For instance, a focus on a patient's goal to add strength training to an exercise regimen is discussed and negotiated with her coach during one session and then revisited with the next biweekly session. The goal may be discussed openly given the supportive nature of the coach-patient relationship and the nondirective exploration of her experience. Moreover, patient-centric aspects of the coaching discussion convey that the patient is resourceful and capable of coming up with and following through on solutions; these aspects include encouragement, focusing on positive progress, nonjudgmental attitude, overlapping, powerful questioning to elicit rationale, advising tentatively, and guiding to specifics. The patient builds and maintains the efficacy needed to continue pursuit of this goal given the support of the coach and the salience of that self-created goal.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48871" xml_f="49553" txt_i="38612" txt_f="39294">Another provider could use these same communication skills and strategies, but given the structure of his or her particular professional role, the process may be more difficult to define as patient-centric. For example, the structure of a session with a nurse may involve also taking a patient's temperature and giving a flu shot. Once the structure of a session shifts to one involving having the provider “do” something to the patient or even evaluate the patient, it becomes difficult for the provider to shift out of the “expert” stance and into a fully patient-centric interaction.

As such, there is a need for effective strategies to motivate individual behavior change and modification. Furthermore, emerging healthcare delivery models rely on engaged and empowered patients to create and maintain such behavior change, as well as communicate their needs and stay highly involved in decision-making processes. Health coaching offers a promising approach for helping to engage and empower patients in this way. As the field of health coaching continues to define itself, an important ongoing question involves how the structure of the session, shaped by the role of the healthcare provider, shapes the empowerment process. As the practice emerges, explication of its tenets, strategies, and theoretical and conceptual underpinnings, such as those noted in this article, should lead to standardization to facilitate more widespread study and employment, furthering healthful outcomes in various settings.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This paper was supported in part by National Institutes of Health grants AT-001-4158 and AT-001-4159.
