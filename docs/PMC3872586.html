Between January 2012 and September 2012, 70 women were hospitalized with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy at Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ege University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey. Of the patients, 16 were managed medically and 54 were managed surgically. Among the surgically managed cases, 10, 4 and 40 women underwent salpingostomy, milking and salpingectomy, respectively. All 40 patients who underwent salpingectomy because of ruptured ectopic pregnancy participated in this study. Patients were informed by the researchers and informed consent was obtained from the patients.

Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated list. Patients and care nurses were blinded with respect to the assignment of a specimen extraction technique. The characteristics of the patients, including age, body mass index (BMI) and obstetric history, were recorded at admission. After the operation, patients recorded the severity of incisional pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating unbearable pain on the post-operative day (POD) 0 and POD 1. The surgical technique, tubal size, specimen extraction time and the length of hospital stay were also recorded.

The operation was performed under endotracheal general anesthesia. The abdominal skin and umbilicus were cleaned with 10% povidone-iodine solution. The Rubin cannula was used for manipulating the uterus. Pneumoperitonization was achieved using a veress needle inserted through the umbilicus and a 10-mm trocar was inserted at the same location for the optic system. Under direct visualization, 2 5-mm ancillary trocars were inserted into the left and right lower abdominal quadrants lateral to the inferior epigastric arteries. First, the ectopic mass was localized by pelvic and upper abdominal visualization after evacuation of the hemoperitoneum caused by the rupture of the ectopic pregnancy. Second, a salpingectomy was performed using bipolar forceps and scissors and the tube was placed in a homemade retrieval bag.

Before the retrieval bag was blindly introduced into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, we lubricated the sterile surgical glove with normal saline to remove the talcum powder. The laparoscope was then re-introduced though the umbilical port. Once in the peritoneal cavity, the bag was opened and the specimen was placed inside the bag under direct vision. The lips of the retrieval bag with the specimen inside were grasped with the laparoscopic instrument handled through the right lower abdominal quadrant. The retrieval bag was then pulled out through the right lower abdominal 5-mm trocar in the transabdominal group. In the transumbilical group, the retrieval bag was pushed into the 10-mm umbilical port from the inside of the abdomen under direct visualization through the same port.

If the specimen was too large to pass through the lower abdominal incision or the umbilical incision, the mouth of the retrieval bag was pulled out manually by the surgeon and the specimen was pulled out using Kocher clamps.

Rescue analgesia (1 g paracetamol) was administered on patient request. The timing of analgesic requirement and the total amount of medication administered were recorded. Patients were scheduled for a follow-up appointment 3 months after the operation, at which time they were interviewed to identify any complication that may have occurred after discharge and were asked to rate their overall satisfaction with the surgical procedure and cosmetic appearance on separate questionnaires.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9"><offsets xml_i="12752" xml_f="12753" txt_i="8023" txt_f="8024">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12760" xml_f="12761" txt_i="8024" txt_f="8025">]</offsets></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="12802" xml_f="12810" txt_i="8026" txt_f="8034">Figure 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="12830" xml_f="12965" txt_i="8034" txt_f="8169">Homemade retrieval bag.

Evaluation of cosmetic results and surgical satisfaction using a subjective questionnaire showed no significant differences in these items between the 2 groups. Since the abdominal wall at the umbilicus is thin, this allows the specimen in the bag can be visualized clearly and this helps to prevent iatrogenic rupture of the bag. On the other hand, the abdominal wall is thick at the lower abdominal port side and this may cause the retrieval bag to get stuck in the abdominal wall. However, in the present study, iatrogenic rupture of the retrieval bag did not occur in any of the patients, which could be attributed to the soft structure of the fallopian tube.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20948" xml_f="21338" txt_i="14472" txt_f="14862">The use of many commercial and homemade specimen retrieval bags has been reported in the literature.

To avoid the risk of rupturing the homemade surgical glove specimen bag with the thread, we did not use a purse string mechanism. Instead, the lips of the retrieval bag were grasped with the laparoscopic instrument and pushed into the 10-mm umbilical port from the abdominal cavity under the direct visualization through the same 10-mm umbilical trocar. Rupture of the homemade retrieval bag did not occur in our study. The use of a 5-mm optical system may facilitate the insertion of the specimen bag in to a 10-mm umbilical trocar inside the abdominal cavity in our technique; however, this is not a realistic expectation in most operating rooms, in which reaching the commercial specimen bag could be difficult. It has been argued that the talcum powder in surgical gloves could negatively affects the intestines and contact of surgical glove with the peritoneal fluid could cause it to collapse, making the collection of specimen difficult. To avoid contamination, surgical gloves were washed with saline to remove the talcum powder in our study. No intestinal complications were reported after the operations. Furthermore, our homemade specimen retrieval bag allows for the removal of specimens larger than the fallopian tube. However, additional investigations are required to determine the efficacy of our homemade retrieval bag and retrieval technique for the removal of larger and more rigid specimens than the fallopian tube.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23106" xml_f="23630" txt_i="16460" txt_f="16984">The results of the present study suggest that fallopian tube removal through a 10-mm umbilical incision after ectopic pregnancy is a simple procedure with shorter operative time than removal through a transabdominal 5-mm incision. In addition, our homemade retrieval bag was shown to be a safe alternative to commercial specimen retrieval bags. Our homemade retrieval bag and retrieval technique should be considered for the laparoscopic removal of specimens, especially soft specimens, without enlarging the 5-mm incisions.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
