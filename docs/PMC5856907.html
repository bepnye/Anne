Two classes of midwifery students (N=62) participated and were randomly assigned to two different groups. One class was selected as the experimental group (n=32) and the other class was considered as the control group (n=30). The experimental group’s students were asked to write questions covering different topics of the syllabus components taught during 15 weeks from February 2016 to May 2016. They were asked to write, answer and explain their multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The students’ performance in immunology course was compared between the two groups at the end of the semester. After their final exam, we asked them to fill in a questionnaire on their views about this activity. The data were analyzed by independent t- test using SPSS software, version 18.

Interactive engagement pedagogies contain several teaching methods that encourage the students to generate questions, actively interact with instructors and take ownership of their learning. One of these approaches named student question generation (SQG) allows engaging students in discovering what they view as relevant and important in the course content they have learned, and in generating question items around this (</offsets><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6289" xml_f="6290" txt_i="2640" txt_f="2641">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6297" xml_f="6298" txt_i="2641" txt_f="2642">-</offsets><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6331" xml_f="6332" txt_i="2642" txt_f="2643">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6339" xml_f="6342" txt_i="2643" txt_f="2646">). </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6349" xml_f="6853" txt_i="2647" txt_f="3151">SQG is defined as the process by which students construct questions around the materials taught, or areas of an instructional content they deem educationally important and relevant, for learning and assessment purposes. It is used as a helpful tool for practicing to promote learning and interest in the material subject when it is implemented as part of the teaching curriculum. This approach provides insights into their knowledge, understanding, and puzzlement, and acts as a window into their minds (</offsets><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6886" xml_f="6887" txt_i="3151" txt_f="3152">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6894" xml_f="6895" txt_i="3152" txt_f="3153">,</offsets><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6928" xml_f="6929" txt_i="3153" txt_f="3154">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6936" xml_f="6939" txt_i="3154" txt_f="3157">). </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6946" xml_f="7982" txt_i="3158" txt_f="4194">A guiding assumption of the research is that deep thinking and reasoning is fostered through contextualized answering of questions. In their ‘depth dynamic model’, It has been postulated how question generation may help the students initiate a process of hypothesizing, predicting, thought-experimenting, and explaining, thereby leading to a cascade of generative activity and helping them to acquire and construct missing pieces of knowledge or resolve conflicts in their understanding. During this process, learning may occur through the formation and rearrangement of cognitive networks as students progressively create explanations and answers to each question. According to information processing theory, such processes can lead to deeper information processing, improved students’ learning and higher levels of cognitive development. Therefore, student-generated questioning requires the students to identify important subjects after reading a passage and generate questions about the points that the students consider important (</offsets><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8015" xml_f="8016" txt_i="4194" txt_f="4195">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8023" xml_f="8024" txt_i="4195" txt_f="4196">,</offsets><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8057" xml_f="8058" txt_i="4196" txt_f="4197">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8065" xml_f="8068" txt_i="4197" txt_f="4200">). </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8075" xml_f="8522" txt_i="4201" txt_f="4648">Indeed, student question generation can be viewed as exercises that involve the students in identifying the problem area of a topic. This strategy helps promote involvement by creating questions over what relevant materials should or should not be in an exam.

Constructing MCQs requires a strong knowledge of the material being assessed as well as a technical skill of making a good question. Therefore, the knowledge required to effectively design a good quality MCQ is greater than that required to answer one.

According to the mentioned reasons, we inserted question generating activity in their Immunology curriculum to engage the students in their subjects actively and continuously; this resulted in an increase in their learning.

Results of our research showed that the case group students believed that this plan had no effects on the improvement of studying and learning in them. The majority of the students showed the least interest in writing questions; they reported that it did not assist them in making connections between ideas learned in immunology courses. They stated that they felt uncomfortable and anxious about participation in the program. Overall, the students slightly agreed with creating MCQs.

Researchers believe that this strategy may not help every student, but it has been shown to help those that put a thoughtful effort into the creation of questions.

The results showed that students did not have a positive attitude towards this strategy and they stated that it was not a useful activity for students’ learning. Students stated that they were annoyed of doing these exercises throughout the semester. A possible explanation for unwillingness of the students is heavy paperwork during the semester, as a large number of students have taken part in question writing exercises during their education and perceived the task as difficult. These results are somewhat in line with earlier research evidence on the students’ writing question. In a study, over half of the students did not show motivational behavior for question-writing; and when they were asked why they did not participate, they ultimately answered it had been due to lack of time 2. The findings of some studies revealed that although students did not express disagreement with homework completion, they suffered from the pressure to do homework (</offsets><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="40540" xml_f="40542" txt_i="25104" txt_f="25106">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40549" xml_f="40550" txt_i="25106" txt_f="25107">,</offsets><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="40584" xml_f="40586" txt_i="25107" txt_f="25109">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40593" xml_f="40596" txt_i="25109" txt_f="25112">). </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40603" xml_f="41502" txt_i="25113" txt_f="26012">Students were not satisfied with this activity due to the high amounts of the course subjects, lack of time for question generating, difficulty of this activity. It means that they do not have a positive attitude toward this activity because they were not interested in doing a difficult and time consuming job. Immunology, as a basic course with 2 units in the second semester, is a non-specific and non-core subject for midwifery students and they are not willing to pay more time for that and it is another probable reason for their dissatisfaction. Despite these two points, their interaction in the activity and more subject studying for question generating result in their better learning and more scores. Therefore, although this study did not show a positive attitude towards question generating strategy, it revealed significant positive effect of this activity on the students' learning. 
</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41509" xml_f="42384" txt_i="26013" txt_f="26888">Overall, although this study performed a statistical measurement of learning benefits after the question-writing activities, it showed that this activity did not enhance the students' motivation and positive dispositions. To find the reason why students disagreed with this activity requires more research. If students consider emotional-psychological climate of a class as a competitive environment in which achieving the goals requires effort, then they will find out that this activity is useful and improves learning. Thus, if teachers have characteristics such as interest in teaching and learning, the ability to manage class, positive views towards class discussion, proficiency on the contents, and higher expectations from students, then most probably students are more motivated and try to get involved in this activity and have more tendency toward this strategy.
</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42391" xml_f="42819" txt_i="26889" txt_f="27317">Furthermore, this study indicates that low performing students had better perceptions toward the questioning activity while the high performing students did not have any positive attitudes. This finding may be interpreted as a desirable effect because the weaker students were supported. This result is consistent with those of the study conducted by Job et al. that evaluated the views of students toward questioning activity (</offsets><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="42853" xml_f="42855" txt_i="27317" txt_f="27319">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42862" xml_f="43165" txt_i="27319" txt_f="27622">). They reported that the low performing students had a significantly better attitude while the high performing students did not consider it a useful activity. They speculated that low performing students spent more time doing these exercises, so they had a more positive attitude toward this activity.
</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43172" xml_f="43407" txt_i="27623" txt_f="27858">Low and high performing students have different learning style preferences; high performing students confirm greater enjoyment in taking responsibility for their own learning and generally have a higher degree of intrinsic motivation (</offsets><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="43441" xml_f="43443" txt_i="27858" txt_f="27860">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43450" xml_f="43552" txt_i="27860" txt_f="27962">). This suggests that low performing students need more or other challenges to be motivated to learn.
</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43559" xml_f="43877" txt_i="27963" txt_f="28281">In fact, implementation of this program creates motivation in the low performing students and has attracted their attention. However, this behavior was not observed in high performing students; this group of students used their own approaches to study and learning and did not much believe in these types of activity.
</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43884" xml_f="44828" txt_i="28282" txt_f="29226">The limitations of this study that might have affected the results are sample size and gender of the participants. The sample used was rather small in size and all of the students who participated in this study were female. The generalizability of this study to other contexts dealing with subject matters of a different nature should thus be exercised with caution. The course was only 15 weeks long. Thus, we had relatively little time to support the students in developing positive attitudes about interactive engagement and conceptual learning. Using similar course content, homogenous students, the same teacher, and pre- and post-test were the strengths of this study. It is also worth pointing out that the questionnaire used to collect data on the observed variables in this study was a self-reported questionnaire using Likert scale, and the issues surrounding this, including socially desirable and response biases, should be noted. 
</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44835" xml_f="45115" txt_i="29227" txt_f="29507">It is recommended that a study should be conducted on medical students in the future. The challenge will be to make sure that the instructors in these courses are open to using this pedagogy and the teaching methods and learning environments in different sections are comparable.

Therefore, involvement of students in writing questions is a technique that can be used to improve academic performance in universities. In this activity that required the students to write examination questions was effective not only as a graded group assignment, but also as a tool to encourage classroom engagement and lead to better examination scores. Although in this study the measurement of learning showed gains after writing MCQ in midwifery students in immunology course, students did not enhance motivation and positive dispositions toward this activity. 
</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45901" xml_f="46169" txt_i="30223" txt_f="30491">Finally, this strategy can be successfully implemented in teaching curricula in future for better training of the students. More research is needed in future to better investigate the importance and suitability of the students’ writing questions in medical education.
