The inability to detect any additional value of robot-assisted reaching may have been due to this pilot study's limited sample size, the specific diagnoses of the participants, or the inclusion of only individuals with chronic stroke.</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6025" xml_f="6035" txt_i="2155" txt_f="2165">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6046" xml_f="6615" txt_i="2166" txt_f="2735">Given the broad range of therapy approaches currently practiced in clinics, therapists face the difficult task of selecting optimal rehabilitation interventions for hemiparetic stroke survivors. One of the most basic decisions is whether or not to provide mechanical assistance during training movements for patients who are too weak or uncoordinated to move successfully by themselves. "Active-assist" exercise is employed in many clinical practices and is consistent with task-specific exercise advocated in standard rehabilitation textbooks (e.g. Carr and Shepherd [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="6646" xml_f="6647" txt_i="2735" txt_f="2736">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6654" xml_f="7027" txt_i="2736" txt_f="3109">]). In this approach, a patient will attempt to make a volitional movement while the therapist provides some form of support for the limb and mechanical assistance to complete the desired movement.

Second, helping a weakened patient complete a movement through a normal range of motion introduces novel somatosensory input that otherwise would not be experienced.

The active assistance algorithm remained idle until a subject initiated movement through at least 1 cm along the track in the outward direction toward the target. After the user advanced the hand piece by 1 cm, the controller would monitor the velocity and position trajectories to detect deviations from the targeted movement in real time. To emphasize the importance of subjects moving under their own efforts, a one centimeter deadband in the position trajectory allowed a subject to be within a small margin of error along the planned path before the motor would provide assistance. Outside of this deadband the motor assisted the subject in maintaining the correct trajectory with a force proportional to a weighted sum of the position and velocity errors.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21852" xml_f="23885" txt_i="14099" txt_f="16132">All reaching movements were practiced over the subject's entire supported passive range of motion (ROM) (i.e. the ROM while reaching along the ARM Guide). Targets were located at the limit of the subject's workspace in each of the pre-assigned directions, where this limit was individualized for each subject with the elbow extended and the shoulder flexed as much as possible without pain. For subjects who could not voluntarily move through this entire passive ROM (8 subjects out of 10), the training task was to reach as fast and as far as possible and prescribed trajectories for the active assistance were planned at velocities 20% greater than those that they were able to achieve without assistance. The screening process for this study did not exclude individuals with significant spasticity. While many participants tended to co-contract during volitional movement, none exhibited hyperactive stretch reflex in the range of speeds used for training â namely speeds slightly greater than their maximum voluntary speeds â as confirmed by electromyographical (EMG) recordings during the pre-training evaluations. The choice of training at speeds 20% greater than the maximum voluntary speed was somewhat arbitrary, but was chosen to reinforce movements that were marginally better than their current abilities demonstrated during the eight pre-training reaches at each session. For subjects who could achieve full ROM before training (N = 2), movements were planned by the device at velocities equal to those measured using their ipsilesional arms during unsupported reaches at a self-selected, comfortable speed. Graphical feedback of the amount of assistance provided by the motor was provided after every fifth reach, and subjects were instructed to try to reduce this assistance level. The feedback was used not only to inform subjects of how they were interacting with the device, but also as a motivational factor to encourage improvement of the reaching performance and to keep them intellectually involved in the task.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23907" xml_f="23940" txt_i="16134" txt_f="16167">Unassisted free reaching training</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23951" xml_f="24864" txt_i="16168" txt_f="17081">Subjects randomized to the free reaching training group performed a matched number of reaches to the same targets as those in the active-assist training group.

Subjects in both training groups performed equal numbers of reaching movements to identical targets, participated in sessions lasting an equal amount of time, and received graphical feedback of performance throughout each session, but only one group received mechanical assistance that helped complete the desired movement. Both groups significantly improved their range of motion and velocity of supported arm movement, and decreased the time to perform functional tasks. Range of free reaching did not improve with training but straightness did. Participants who practiced free reaching improved the smoothness of their movements.

This stimulus of the subject practicing movement, with or without assistance, appears to have had a slow and gradual effect: range and speed improved gradually and continuously over training (Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"><offsets xml_i="46898" xml_f="46899" txt_i="33011" txt_f="33012">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46906" xml_f="47140" txt_i="33012" txt_f="33246">), at a comparable rate for both training groups, which practiced matched amounts of movements.

This is not to imply that any participants degraded in their arm movement ability.

However, removal of these two subjects from the analysis had no impact on the outcomes. The multivariate ANOVA on the biomechanical outcomes still indicated improvements post-training in the entire subject pool (p &lt; 0.001) and a lack of differences in those improvements between the two training groups (interaction p &gt; 0.9).

The greater improvement in unsupported reaching smoothness by the free reaching group may have been due to the fact that the task being measured in this evaluation was identical to the one that was practiced by this group. Further, the robotic device enforced movements to be smoother in the active-assist trained group; the effect of reducing movement errors may have been to diminish the motor system's attempts to correct those errors. This is in agreement with recent findings comparing the relative effects of trajectory error amplification and error reduction in upper extremity movement practice for individuals with chronic hemiparesis [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"><offsets xml_i="49226" xml_f="49228" txt_i="35214" txt_f="35216">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49235" xml_f="49237" txt_i="35216" txt_f="35218">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49244" xml_f="49944" txt_i="35219" txt_f="35919">An interesting finding was that the subjects improved their ability to perform functional tasks, but did not improve the unsupported range of reaching. A possible explanation is that the functional tasks were performed on a table with the objects being manipulated kept close to the body. Free reaching required subjects to attempt to locate the hand away from the body, requiring considerable shoulder strength. The shoulder strength increases caused by the present movement training program may have been substantial enough to improve supported reaching and some proximal movements associated with the functional tasks, but not large enough to improve the ability to extend the arm against gravity.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49951" xml_f="50599" txt_i="35920" txt_f="36568">The finding that the robotic active assistance did not provide statistically significant, additional value beyond the movement practice that occurred concurrently with it should be taken with several caveats. First and foremost, the small sample size of this pilot study precludes estimating the precise difference between the active-assist and free reaching groups.

The active-assist algorithm that we used had the following features: it required the subject to initiate movement, completed abnormal movements along a suitable trajectory, and provided graphical feedback of the subject's contribution to movement. However, a therapist, or a better-designed robotic movement training system, may be better able to discern when exactly assistance is needed, and may be better able to grade the level of assistance needed.

It may be that active-assist training will eventually be determined to be beneficial for specific subgroups of patients, such as those with proprioceptive deficits, high levels of spasticity, or perhaps during acute recovery for flaccid patients. Much of the stroke rehabilitation literature is divided by the stage of recovery of study participants, with some studies concentrating on subacute stroke and others focusing on chronic stroke.
