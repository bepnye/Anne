Further exploration of individual predictors of eligibility using GP data (e.g. morbidity indicators) in this study was hindered by the small sample size. It may be possible in future work to improve recruitment materials to persuade others likely to gain from a welfare rights assessment to participate.

The six month delay prior to the control group's benefit assessment was thought to be a reasonable compromise between impeding the receipt of benefit entitlements and allowing time for any health improvements to appear. This was justified ethically on the grounds that the intervention is presently rationed and recipients would not have been identified within the welfare rights officer's normal caseload. However, 14% of those eligible for financial benefits did not receive them until after the six month follow up assessment, and the average time between receipt of financial benefits and the next assessment was only two months. Health improvements resulting from increased benefits may not be detectable after such a short time. The time lapse needed for additional resources to have any effect on health is unclear, but there is a methodological argument for delaying the welfare rights advice longer in the control group in a future trial.
