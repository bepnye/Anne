The potential adverse consequences of sick leave due to Stress-related Mental Disorders (SMDs) are extensive, but often not recognised. Since most people having SMDs with sick leave consult their general practitioner (GP) at an early stage, a tailored intervention given by GPs is justified. We provide a detailed description of the MISS; that is more accurate assessment, education, advice and monitoring to treat SMDs in patients on sick leave. Our hypothesis is that the MISS will be more effective compared to the usual care, in reducing days of sick leave of these patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="5219" xml_f="5226" txt_i="900" txt_f="907">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5237" xml_f="5890" txt_i="908" txt_f="1561">The design is a pragmatic RCT.

Fatigue, tenseness, irritability, apathy, sleeping disorder, emotional instability, rumination and concentration- problems are examples of common symptoms related to stress and a failure to cope with demands while resources (i.e. the abilities to meet those demands) are not sufficient.

However, for a long time the usual approach to SMDs with sick leave was the reverse: advice to take rest and not return to work before all complaints had disappeared.

Moreover, the value of work is undisputed and in cases of (prolonged) sick leave there is a risk of permanent loss of employment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9636" xml_f="9696" txt_i="4803" txt_f="4863">General Practice treatment of SMDs in patients on sick leave</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9707" xml_f="10066" txt_i="4864" txt_f="5223">Nearly every employee contacts the GP at the beginning of the sick leave.

Due to the collaborative nature of the doctor-patient relationship in general practice, many GPs may be overly cautious to attribute symptoms to a psychosocial cause. Another issue is an adequate differential diagnosis; many patients in primary care have symptoms related to anxiety, depression, somatization, or all three. In one out of five patients having a SMD there are prominent, although unrecognised symptoms of depression or anxiety, which are associated with a poor prognosis. A further pitfall is that GPs often tend to go along with the patient's request for rest and being left alone. Often GPs advise to go or stay on sick leave, to take rest, seek distraction and relaxation, instead of actively confront and cope with the difficulties. The distress of a lasting crisis combined with existing vulnerabilities may lead to prolonged disability and contribute to the development of serious mental disorders, e.g. depression or anxiety disorders.
