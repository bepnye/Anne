The most suitable approach to determine the cost-effectiveness of a complex intervention such as MR is to perform a RCT which collates data on cost from the appropriate perspective and outcomes which are most proximal to the intervention. Within the UK, it is additionally necessary to collect data on quality of life and mortality to enable the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to be estimated.

The study SOP required pharmacists to undertake initial MR, follow-up on all interventions to ensure that discrepancies had been addressed, assess all discharge letters for accuracy and correct them. Patients in the control arm frequently did not always receive all four elements and this probably explains most of the difference in time provided. It has been suggested that organisations are probably unlikely to repeat the benefits from MR services reported in the literature if there are deficiencies in intervention intensity and breadth.</offsets><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="41202" xml_f="41204" txt_i="24922" txt_f="24924">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41211" xml_f="41459" txt_i="24924" txt_f="25172"> The results from the control arm of this study support this assertion and suggest that if MR of a similar nature to that seen in the intervention arm was to be shown to be cost-effective, then this would require significantly more pharmacist time.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41466" xml_f="41903" txt_i="25173" txt_f="25610">The proportion of patients screened for eligibility and eventually recruited to the study was 20% and this could have been improved by increasing the number of weekends covered (from 80% to 100%).

Both are unrealistic assumptions and ideally within a definitive study all data should have been reviewed independent of the service and blinded to group allocation. The unblinded identification of MRs and inability to confirm intentional or unintentional nature of errors in many instances also means that the data on UDs must be treated with further caution.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42427" xml_f="42891" txt_i="26122" txt_f="26586">The process of collating all medicines-related data at different time points and sealing it until 3 months postdischarge provides an opportunity to identify discrepancies without adversely affecting the intervention. While the identification of UDs should be undertaken blind of allocation, the resources required for this may not be warranted when considering that the intentional or unintentional nature of the discrepancy cannot always be accurately determined.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42898" xml_f="43125" txt_i="26587" txt_f="26814">Considering evidence published poststudy completion, limiting the study population to those over the age of 70 and including a postdischarge telephone call as part of the intervention may have further enhanced the intervention.</offsets><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="43157" xml_f="43159" txt_i="26814" txt_f="26816">13</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="43173" xml_f="43336" txt_i="26817" txt_f="26980">In line with previous research, the intervention prevented a large number of unintentional medicines-related discrepancies both during admission and postdischarge.</offsets><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="43367" xml_f="43370" txt_i="26980" txt_f="26983">3–6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43377" xml_f="43709" txt_i="26983" txt_f="27315"> The data obtained suggest that just less than a quarter of UDs identified at discharge were found to actually translate into primary care records at 3 months.

Using data on ‘unplanned readmission at 3 months' would seem to be the most appropriate primary outcome measure for a future definitive study as it is a patient-orientated outcome which is most likely to reflect the effect of errors which occur at all stages of the process. Similar to hospital readmission, LOS is a cost which would be captured in any cost-effectiveness analysis. LOS was however found to be largely skewed by a small number of individuals who were admitted for extended periods. Furthermore, it is not affected by errors which translate into primary care, that is, does not reflect the full impact of the service. Within the UK, hospitals are penalised for unplanned readmissions within 1 month of discharge and therefore collection of this data may also be warranted for a UK-based definitive study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44707" xml_f="44803" txt_i="28301" txt_f="28397">Unplanned readmission has been used as a primary outcome measure within other similar MR trials.</offsets><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="44835" xml_f="44840" txt_i="28397" txt_f="28402">25–29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44847" xml_f="44926" txt_i="28402" txt_f="28481"> While differences in unplanned readmission at 3 months have been demonstrated,</offsets><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="44958" xml_f="44960" txt_i="28481" txt_f="28483">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44967" xml_f="44968" txt_i="28483" txt_f="28484">

However, it was conducted as an RCT, conforming to expected standards and consequently it can be assumed that it would be possible to perform a full-scale RCT in the future. An internal pilot would be warranted in such a trial as the trial should be multicentre in nature and consequently local variations in recruitment rates and service delivery would require identification and appropriate local adaptation. Additionally, costs related to service delivery may differ between settings and consequently time for service delivery would require estimation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47088" xml_f="47599" txt_i="30413" txt_f="30924">The pilot study has shown that it is feasible to perform an RCT to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist MR within 24 hours of admission and again at discharge. This study has demonstrated that this form of intervention does appear to reduce medication errors at discharge, and may reduce LOS and hospital readmissions.
