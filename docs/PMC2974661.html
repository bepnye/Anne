Finding a control for a visible intervention is challenging and needs careful consideration to what is acceptable to patients. The preliminary evidence of effectiveness of the HHF could not be proved. Patients often stopped using the HHF but a small group seemed to benefit which was not necessarily related to a relief in breathlessness. Therefore, more work is necessary on selecting and identifying those who might benefit from the HHF.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6104" xml_f="6122" txt_i="2231" txt_f="2249">Trial registration</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6133" xml_f="6175" txt_i="2250" txt_f="2292">ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01123902</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6237" xml_f="6247" txt_i="2301" txt_f="2311">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6258" xml_f="6330" txt_i="2312" txt_f="2384">Breathlessness is a common and distressing symptom in advanced disease [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="6361" xml_f="6362" txt_i="2384" txt_f="2385">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6369" xml_f="6436" txt_i="2385" txt_f="2452">] which is still poorly understood and not managed satisfactorily [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="6467" xml_f="6468" txt_i="2452" txt_f="2453">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6475" xml_f="6619" txt_i="2453" txt_f="2597">].

This latter study tested the HHF directed five minutes to the face or leg and crossed over to the other treatment with a 10 minutes washout period. As the results of this study were promising, the HHF should be tested in a real world setting where patients use it over time. However, before setting up an adequately powered RCT we felt that a number of questions needed to be addressed about the feasibility of such a study. Therefore, we ran an exploratory phase II study to test a HHF for breathlessness which aimed to evaluate the use and acceptance of the intervention and the control, the potential effectiveness of the HHF, the recruitment into the study, and collecting data for calculating a sample size.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="8482" xml_f="8489" txt_i="4155" txt_f="4162">Methods</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8509" xml_f="8515" txt_i="4163" txt_f="4169">Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8526" xml_f="8695" txt_i="4170" txt_f="4339">As we wanted to assess how the HHF worked over time, we embedded this RCT in a longitudinal cohort study which aimed to describe the course of breathlessness over time [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="8726" xml_f="8727" txt_i="4339" txt_f="4340">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8734" xml_f="8736" txt_i="4340" txt_f="4342">].</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8758" xml_f="8781" txt_i="4344" txt_f="4367">Setting and recruitment</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8792" xml_f="9587" txt_i="4368" txt_f="5163">Recruitment to the longitudinal study took place from the oncology and/or respiratory departments in three major hospitals (one tertiary respiratory hospital), a hospice home care service and two respiratory practices in Munich, Germany.

Seven patients expressed negative experiences regarding the HHF reporting "it makes me nervous" (COPD patient) or "it is more like a toy, but doesn't help" (COPD patient). Two patients reported that the HHF was defective. One patient was very sensitive to the air draught produced by the HHF. Eight patients did not comment further on their experiences. Patients testing the wristband reported the following: 5/32 patients expressed positive experiences such as "it is reassuring to wear it" (COPD patient) or "I rely on it" (cancer patient). Four patients were rather negative pointing out that it is "foolish" (cancer patient) or "not helpful" (COPD patient).

Reasons for non-participation varied from irritation by cold air to lack of belief in the intervention or the control. It can only be surmised why patients believed neither in the intervention nor the control.

It is noteworthy that patients who refused participation in the RCT had less breathlessness and a better functional status compared to those who participated. Hence, RCT-participants were more ill than their counterparts. It can be assumed that those participating were more motivated to try something to relieve their breathlessness.

The benefit from the HHF was not necessarily related to a relief in breathlessness severity. Thus, further research should identify those patients who benefit from the HHF and explore reasons for the beneficial effect. However, for most patients neither the HHF nor the wristband was popular.

Selecting a control for a non-pharmacological intervention is challenging and needs careful consideration to what is acceptable to patients. Symptom burden and low functional status did not restrain patients from participation in the study which emphasises the importance of giving patients the choice whether they want to take part in research or not.
