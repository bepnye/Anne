The risk of bias was generally low, with the quality of most of the studies being high. Vaginal preparation immediately before caesarean delivery significantly reduced the incidence of post-caesarean endometritis from 8.3% in control groups to 4.3% in vaginal cleansing groups. To detect a difference of this size with 90% power and alpha at 5%, we would require 1548 participants.

With the increasing evidence regarding antimicrobial resistance and the development of bacterial resistance there, is concern that without action, common procedures such as CS will carry significant risks. We must, therefore, seek strategies that reduce this risk. We aim to perform a feasibility study for a larger multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing vaginal cleansing with chlorhexidine versus standard practice of no vaginal cleansing immediately before CS to reduce post-partum endometritis and sepsis. There are a number of difficulties in performing a RCT in pregnant women undergoing CS, particularly in an emergency procedure where there is a short interval between decision and delivery. Additionally, the follow-up of women post-CS is unlike other surgical procedures: mothers are discharged from obstetric care quickly with no routine post-operative follow-up. They are motivated to recover and care for their baby. It is therefore necessary to perform this feasibility trial to assess both our ability to recruit women and adequately follow them up. The main limitation of this feasibility study is that it is being performed within units motivated to perform the feasibility trial and this may not accurately represent recruitment in all sites.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title><offsets xml_i="43675" xml_f="43685" txt_i="31455" txt_f="31465">Conclusion</offsets></title><p id="Par138"><offsets xml_i="43708" xml_f="43973" txt_i="31466" txt_f="31731">This is a feasibility randomised controlled trial, assessing the feasibility of performing a trial of vaginal chlorohexidine cleansing to prevent post-natal infection.
