In an amendment to the original protocol (amendment 2.1) that was introduced after 7 patients had been randomized, oral- or pharyngeal mucositis pain of ≥40 mm on a 0 to 100 mm VAS was added as an inclusion criterion to ensure that patients had pain in either the oral cavity or pharynx when they were randomized. In a subsequent amendment (amendment 5), the ability to use electronic devices was removed and a paper diary was introduced instead, because the initial patients had problems registering pain and pain medication intake in the electronic diaries. Five patients (3 in the Lozenge group and 2 in the Control group) used the electronic diary and the remaining patients used the paper diary. The exclusion criteria in the original protocol were need for pain treatment with morphine before the start of radiotherapy, known allergy to bupivacaine or other local anesthetics of the amide type, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.

After randomization, the patients in the Lozenge group assessed pain in the oral cavity and the pharynx before and 60 minutes after administration of a lozenge and recorded their values in their patient diary (electronic or paper); patients in the Control group assessed pain in the oral cavity and the pharynx separately on the VAS every 2 hours when awake.

Patients were informed to take lozenges every 2 hours during waking hours up to a maximum of 8 lozenges per day. Each time a patient entered a pain score in the electronic diary, the time of the scoring was recorded automatically. In the paper diary, the patient noted both the time of administration of lozenges as well as the time of pain scoring.

In one study, 8 patients with oral mucositis were treated with ketamine mouthwash plus intravenously administered opioids. Five of the 8 patients experienced relief of their mucositis pain, but 4 patients experienced side effects which were probably related to the ketamine mouthwash.

However, the tested systemic drugs have disadvantages in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and/or patient friendliness.

Two patients withdrew because of hyperalgesia. Study personnel were instructed to be alert to any symptoms indicating systemic toxicity of bupivacaine, and no such symptoms were reported. The reporting of AEs focused on possible side effects of the treatment and did not focus on medical conditions that are common in the studied patient population, such as nausea and somnolence. Patients undergoing radiotherapy often experience dry mouth because of reduced saliva production. In the present study, this may give rise to a prolonged dissolution of the lozenge and reduce the effect of bupivacaine by delaying its transport to the oral cavity and pharynx. The fact that the patients were not hospitalized but instead used a patient diary at home to register pain scores as outpatients made it difficult to ensure that they registered all the required pain scores. However, compliance was judged to be satisfactory as there were enough pain registrations to analyze the data. The severity of oral mucositis was assessed using the World Health Organization scale for oral mucositis. Unfortunately, the study personnel who did the assessments focused solely on visible changes in the oral mucosa; they failed to appreciate that pain, by definition, renders a score of at least 1. This explains why some patients had a mucositis score of 0 at randomization despite a baseline pain score of ≥40 mm.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35926" xml_f="36662" txt_i="26693" txt_f="27429">The pain-relieving effect of bupivacaine lozenges has not been tested in a blinded placebo-controlled study. It is difficult to design a blinded placebo-controlled study for several reasons, not least that it would be difficult to blind patients because the local anesthetic effect of bupivacaine has been found to be instant and strong. Therefore, not only is there a risk of unintended bias in favor of the local anesthetic lozenge, but also patients will know whether or not they are receiving the active drug, which makes it very difficult to use a placebo-controlled design. For these reasons, a placebo group was not considered appropriate for this study and the most relevant control was considered to be standard pain treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36669" xml_f="37564" txt_i="27430" txt_f="28325">In conclusion, the tested bupivacaine lozenge was found to be an effective and safe treatment to reduce pain due to oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer. Further clinical investigations are warranted to investigate whether the bupivacaine lozenge may improve pain relief in this difficult-to-treat condition. Indeed, a multicountry phase III trial is planned. Furthermore, the effect of the bupivacaine lozenge on other important outcomes should also be investigated. Such outcomes might include quality of life, patient nutrition, and the risk of an intermission in cancer treatment due to inadequate patient nutrition. Finally, because the bupivacaine lozenge is a noninvasive and patient-friendly way to alleviate oral mucositis pain, it should be investigated in patients with other cancer diagnoses who also have oral mucositis, such as patients with bone marrow transplant.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s5"><title><offsets xml_i="37594" xml_f="37605" txt_i="28327" txt_f="28338">Disclosures</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37616" xml_f="38431" txt_i="28339" txt_f="29154">S.
