Total energy expenditure was not significantly different between HANDHELD (44.9 ± 11.6 kcal) and CTRL (38.2 ± 6.0 kcal). Active video game drumming at expert-level significantly increased energy expenditure compared to handheld, but it hardly met moderate-intensity activity standards, and energy expenditure was greatest during walking. Energy expenditure with handheld video game drumming was not different from no-exercise control. Thus, traditional aerobic exercise remains at the forefront for achieving the minimum amount and intensity of physical activity for health, individuals desiring to use video games for achieving weekly physical activity recommendations should choose games that require significant involvement of lower-body musculature, and time spent playing sedentary games should be a limited part of an active lifestyle.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Calorie expenditure</kwd><kwd>moderate-intensity exercise</kwd><kwd>cognitive task</kwd><kwd>metabolic rate</kwd><kwd>interactive screen time</kwd><kwd>exergaming</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title><offsets xml_i="6233" xml_f="6245" txt_i="1930" txt_f="1942">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6256" xml_f="6435" txt_i="1943" txt_f="2119">American adults (&gt; 18 y) are participating in more sedentary screen-based activities including television viewing and video game playing than at any previous point in history (</offsets><xref rid="b5-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6481" xml_f="6482" txt_i="2119" txt_f="2120">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6489" xml_f="6491" txt_i="2120" txt_f="2122">, </offsets><xref rid="b10-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6538" xml_f="6540" txt_i="2122" txt_f="2124">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6547" xml_f="6549" txt_i="2124" txt_f="2126">, </offsets><xref rid="b19-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6596" xml_f="6598" txt_i="2126" txt_f="2128">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6605" xml_f="7097" txt_i="2128" txt_f="2620">).

Participants played identical song lists, using the same video game, at the same time of the day, and on the same day of the week. Furthermore, scores (%) for the completion of each required note for each song were similar between the handheld and active drumming trials for all participants (&lt; 3% difference). The only other study to our knowledge that compared similar virtual and active video games was a study by Barkley and Penko (</offsets><xref rid="b2-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="28646" xml_f="28647" txt_i="20761" txt_f="20762">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="28654" xml_f="29131" txt_i="20762" txt_f="21239">). In that study, adults performed active Wii Sports® Boxing during one trial, and a similar PunchOut!!® boxing game as a handheld virtual simulation. Different from our study, however, the boxing games did not allow the researchers to standardize the responses and activities of the opponent in the game, making the two video game activities inconsistent. Furthermore, participants in the Barkley and Penko study were playing essentially two completely different video games (</offsets><xref rid="b2-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="29177" xml_f="29178" txt_i="21239" txt_f="21240">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="29185" xml_f="29427" txt_i="21240" txt_f="21482">). Therefore, the data from the current study represent the first comparison of energy costs between standardized active versus virtual handheld video game play, with active drumming resulting in approximately 75 more total calories expended.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29434" xml_f="29690" txt_i="21483" txt_f="21739">We also compared handheld drumming with a control resting trial to determine if the cognitive task associated with playing resulted in any additional energy cost above resting, and it did not. These current findings are different from previously reported (</offsets><xref rid="b2-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="29736" xml_f="29737" txt_i="21739" txt_f="21740">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="29744" xml_f="29746" txt_i="21740" txt_f="21742">, </offsets><xref rid="b14-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="29793" xml_f="29795" txt_i="21742" txt_f="21744">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="29802" xml_f="30098" txt_i="21744" txt_f="22040">), but a potential explanation may be related to differences in dependent variables analyzed. For example, Al-Naher et al. (2016) reported significant metabolic increases above resting (1.05 versus 1.21 METS) while performing a simple cognitive task (math) requiring only minimal button pushing (</offsets><xref rid="b1-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="30144" xml_f="30145" txt_i="22040" txt_f="22041">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30152" xml_f="30210" txt_i="22041" txt_f="22099">). However, when we converted their data from kcals·kg·day</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="30215" xml_f="30217" txt_i="22099" txt_f="22101">−1</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="30223" xml_f="30356" txt_i="22101" txt_f="22234"> to kcals (using a 70 kg man), the estimated increase from 30 minutes of cognitive testing (compared to resting) was only 5.9 kcals (</offsets><xref rid="b1-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="30402" xml_f="30403" txt_i="22234" txt_f="22235">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30410" xml_f="31319" txt_i="22235" txt_f="23144">). This estimated difference was very similar to our findings, where 30 minutes of handheld drumming was approximately 6.7 kcals greater on average than resting. Therefore, there was a negligible energy cost associated with the cognitive task of handheld video game drumming, despite the fact that our participants played at an expert-level. In fact, the majority of the 6.7 kcal increase can likely be explained by contractile activity from the thumbs and fingers, with very little energy cost actually coming from performing the cognitive task, however further research is evidently needed. Indeed, other studies that reported increased metabolism with sedentary video games did not make efforts to minimize extraneous movements, but instead were attempting to quantify the energy costs of playing those games authentically by allowing standing, upright sitting, rocking, or moving that naturally occurred (</offsets><xref rid="b2-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="31365" xml_f="31366" txt_i="23144" txt_f="23145">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31373" xml_f="31375" txt_i="23145" txt_f="23147">, </offsets><xref rid="b14-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="31422" xml_f="31424" txt_i="23147" txt_f="23149">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31431" xml_f="31433" txt_i="23149" txt_f="23151">, </offsets><xref rid="b20-ijes_10_7_1038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="31480" xml_f="31482" txt_i="23151" txt_f="23153">20</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="31496" xml_f="33067" txt_i="23154" txt_f="24725">To help us better understand the potential value of active video game drumming as an option for weekly physical activity requirements, the current study tested whether energy expenditure during drumming at an expert-level would be greater than moderate-intensity walking. While energy expenditure during active drumming did not exceed walking, it seems likely that it may provide health benefits that outweigh sedentary gaming. A nearly identical handheld protocol was also tested to determine if sedentary video game play (and the cognitive task of drumming) would elicit a significant increase in energy expenditure above resting. Supporting national recommendations that sedentary screen-time should be limited, the handheld drumming protocol elicited essentially no change in resting metabolism. In conclusion, traditional aerobic exercise remains the more effective mode for promoting health benefits because active video game drumming hardly met moderate-intensity criteria. Individuals should select video games that require more involvement from lower-body musculature in order to maximize energy expenditure and help work towards meeting national physical activity recommendations. Lastly, the songs that were chosen for the DRUM protocol (although all played on the expert difficulty setting) varied in their speed, intrinsic difficulty, and the volume of kick pedal use. Future research is warranted to determine if a set-list consisting of more difficult songs or songs that utilize the kick pedal could elicit higher rates of energy expenditure than walking.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank the volunteers for their participation in this study.
