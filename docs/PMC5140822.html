Methods] Thirty subjects were randomly divided into an experimental group (n=15) and a
control group (n=15). The subjects in the experimental group covered their eyes using a
blindfold, climbed onto a horse riding simulator, and performed the horse riding
simulation exercise. The control group took part in the horse riding exercises without a
blindfold. All of the subjects performed the 20 minutes long exercise once a day, five
times a week, over a four-week period. [Results] The experimental group showed significant
improvement in static balance, dynamic balance, velocity, and cadence compared to
pre-intervention measurements. In addition, the control group showed significant
improvement in static balance, dynamic balance, single support, and cadence compared to
pre-intervention measurements. Significant differences in post-training gains in static
balance, dynamic balance, and cadence were observed between the experimental group and the
control group. [Conclusion] Subjects that performed horse riding simulation exercise after
blindfolding showed significant improvements in balance and cadence compared to the
control group.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Horse riding simulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="4698" xml_f="4710" txt_i="1329" txt_f="1341">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4721" xml_f="4931" txt_i="1342" txt_f="1552">Walking is the most common form of human motion, and is composed of cyclically switching

Normal sensory feedback and an
ability for integrated higher center control are required to continuously maintain the
body’s center of gravity within the base of support in the body. Overall, balance is divided
into static and dynamic abilities. Maintenance of balance requires a complex process
requiring visual and vestibular organs and proper somatosensory response</offsets><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="5626" xml_f="5627" txt_i="2118" txt_f="2119">2</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="5639" xml_f="5640" txt_i="2119" txt_f="2120">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="5646" xml_f="5968" txt_i="2120" txt_f="2442">. Among the sensory organs necessary for
maintaining balance, vision plays a significant role in maintaining gait and balance. When
vision is blocked, there is an increased reliance on the vestibular, proprioceptive, and
tactile senses. Hence blindfolding can facilitate these senses and improve balance and gait
abilities</offsets><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="5999" xml_f="6000" txt_i="2442" txt_f="2443">2</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="6012" xml_f="6013" txt_i="2443" txt_f="2444">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="6019" xml_f="6020" txt_i="2444" txt_f="2445">.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6027" xml_f="6539" txt_i="2446" txt_f="2958">In recent years, exercises such as the Swiss ball exercise, proprioceptive neuromuscular

improve balance and gait for stroke or polio patients. Horse riding simulation exercise is a
feedback exercise designed to correct postural changes following the movements of a

The participants’ head movements were minimized by guiding them to gaze at a fixed forward

A horse riding
simulation exercise generates 50 to 100 three-dimensional physical movements (front and
back, left and right, up and down) due to the movements of the horse riding exercise
machine. This exercise can produce effects similar to walking, activate the trunk muscles to
continuously maintain balance, and help correct posture</offsets><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="17407" xml_f="17408" txt_i="10540" txt_f="10541">8</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="17420" xml_f="17421" txt_i="10541" txt_f="10542">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="17427" xml_f="17594" txt_i="10542" txt_f="10709">.

riding simulation exercise with blindfolding. This may be because the subjects have an
increased reliance on the vestibular organs and somatosensory system. This then improves the
subjects’ motor control, enabling proper maintenance of physical alignment and the
spontaneous control of movement</offsets><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18191" xml_f="18192" txt_i="11220" txt_f="11221">3</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="18204" xml_f="18205" txt_i="11221" txt_f="11222">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="18211" xml_f="18523" txt_i="11222" txt_f="11534">. In
addition, the improvement in gait found in the study may be from the improved stability and
coordination in the trunk. This may have occurred through motor learning of the trunk
according to the changes in the base of support. This result suggests that a horse riding
simulator can improve balance and gait.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18530" xml_f="18749" txt_i="11535" txt_f="11754">As the horse riding simulation exercise generates higher levels of self-motivation and
