Using a prospective study in a gynecologic laparoscopic center, a total of 52 women who underwent TLH from June 2013 to January 2014 were assigned into two groups. In group A, uterine arteries were ligated after the cornual pedicles as done conventionally. In group B, TLH was done by ligating both uterine arteries at the beginning of the procedure. All the other pedicles were desiccated using harmonic scalpel or bipolar diathermy. Uterus with cervix was removed vaginally or by morcellation. The indication for TLH was predominantly dysfunctional uterine bleeding and myomas in both groups.

Surgical Technique</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6903" xml_f="8068" txt_i="3493" txt_f="4658">Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in modified lithotomy position. A Veress needle is inserted at the umbilicus or supraumbilical site depending on the size of the uterus and abdomen is insufflated with carbon dioxide at initial pressure of 20 mm Hg and maintenance at 15 mm Hg. A 10 mm trocar is inserted blindly and 10 mm telescope is introduced through this port. Uterus and the adnexa were visualized. Three additional 5mm ports are introduced: one along the left spinoumbilical line at the junction of medial 2/3rd and lateral 1/3rd, second port at right angles to the previous port two ports, and a third 5 mm port placed around 2 cm below and to the right of umbilicus. The entire abdomen is surveyed before starting the procedure. The size of the uterus, presence of myomas, and adnexa and course of ureters are visualized. Manipulation of the uterus was done with a 5 mm myoma spiral laparoscopically. No vaginal manipulators were used. Uterine artery was dissected by a lateral approach. A window was created in the broad ligament, close to the uterine vessels. The ascending branch of the uterine artery is identified close to the isthmus (</offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><offsets xml_i="8100" xml_f="8108" txt_i="4658" txt_f="4666">Figure 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8115" xml_f="8268" txt_i="4666" txt_f="4819">). The uterine vessels are ligated at this level close to the uterus using 1-0 delayed absorbable suture material or coagulated using bipolar diathermy (</offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><offsets xml_i="8300" xml_f="8308" txt_i="4819" txt_f="4827">Figure 2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8315" xml_f="9016" txt_i="4827" txt_f="5528">). The uterine artery is not sutured away from the uterus as the ureters cross beneath them at that level. Dissecting the uterovesical fold and pushing the bladder down move the ureters laterally and decrease the risk of including them in the suture. The vasculature of the uterus is thus secured and this is evidenced by the color change in the fundus, which becomes pale. The cornual pedicles on one side are then desiccated and cut either using bipolar diathermy or the harmonic ultracision. The ligated uterine pedicles are cut. The uterosacral and cardinal ligaments are desiccated and cut. The position of the myoma spiral is then changed so that the opposite side pedicles can be taken care of.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9023" xml_f="10267" txt_i="5529" txt_f="6773">If both ovaries need to be removed, the infundibulopelvic ligaments are desiccated and cut. Now a vaginal cuff is introduced through the vagina to identify the vault and the anterior lip of cervix held with a tenaculum. Vault cut laparoscopically using monopolar hook and the specimen is detached completely. The uterus with cervix is delivered vaginally if small. In case of large uteri, the specimen can be retrieved by morcellation through abdominal port. We prefer to use the contralateral ports for suturing. The right midquadrant port and the left lower quadrant port are ergonomically apt for suturing. The vaginal vault is sutured with number 1 delayed absorbable suture (vicryl). Ports closed using staples. The total blood loss is calculated from the suction apparatus. The blood in the suction tube is also measured to give the accurate value. No irrigation is used throughout the procedure until the calculation of the total blood loss. Peritoneal lavage is given with normal saline solution and 500 mL of normal saline is left in the peritoneal cavity. The catheter is removed after 6 hours and liquid diet started after peristalsis is established. The patient is discharged the following day and called for follow-up after 7 days.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title><offsets xml_i="10299" xml_f="10309" txt_i="6775" txt_f="6785">4.
