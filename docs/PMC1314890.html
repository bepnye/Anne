Both topical and oral non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat this. Oral NSAIDS are effective, at least in the short term, but can have severe adverse effects. Topical NSAIDs also appear to be effective, at least in the short term. One might expect topical NSAIDs both to be less effective and to have fewer adverse effects than oral NSAIDs. If topical NSAIDs have fewer adverse effects this may outweigh both the reduction in effectiveness and the higher cost of topical compared to oral treatment.

As this is a study lasting over a year, we expect that many patients will change their treatment if pain relief is inadequate.

Our hypothesis is that the oral treatment will have greater side effects. Patients for whom the oral and topical treatment would be equally effective at pain relief will be expected to have more side effects if they are allocated to oral rather than topical treatment. Patients who persist with topical treatment that is less effective than oral treatment may have more pain and fewer side effects. Patients who rapidly change if topical is less effective than oral are likely over the longer term to have similar side effects and pain to patients already on oral treatment. Because patients cannot be expected to remain on inadequate treatment, an intention-to-treat analysis is more appropriate than an on-treatment analysis. The latter would be required for a typical equivalence study. Understanding the results depends crucially on the pattern of combined benefits and harms from the two treatments. However, as the combined effects require a judgement to be made of the relative value of pain relief and side effects, we will first analyse pain and side effects separately. For pain we will be considering whether the outcomes are different or equivalent; for side effects we are interested only if they are different. Then we will seek to demonstrate whether overall patient outcomes (benefits and harms) are better, or worse, if general practitioners advise treatment with either topical or oral NSAIDs, for a range of weightings of pain and side effects.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="15142" xml_f="15166" txt_i="9152" txt_f="9176">Patient preference study</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="15177" xml_f="15314" txt_i="9177" txt_f="9314">In addition to the RCT, there is a parallel patient preference study (PPS).
