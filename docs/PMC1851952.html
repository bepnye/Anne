About 30% of Dutch workers are on sick leave after maternity leave. Structural contact of supervisors with employees on maternity leave, supported by early medical advice of occupational physicians, may increase the chances of return-to-work after maternity leave. In addition, to understand the process of sick leave and return-to-work after childbirth it is important to gain insight into which factors hinder return-to-work after childbirth, as well, as which prognostic factors lead to the development of postpartum health complaints.

Pregnant women working for at least 12 hours a week at one of the 15 participating companies are eligible to participate. The supervisors of these pregnant employees are randomised at 35 weeks pregnancy into the intervention group or control group. During maternity leave, supervisors in the intervention group contact their employee six weeks after delivery using a structured interview. When employees do not expect to return to their jobs at the end of their scheduled maternity leave due to health problems, the supervisor offers early support of the occupational physician. Supervisors in the control group have no structural contact with their employees during maternity leave. Measurements take place at 30 weeks pregnancy and at 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks postpartum. In addition, cost data are collected. For the RCT, primary outcome measures are sick leave and return-to-work, and secondary outcome measures are costs, health, satisfaction with intervention and global feelings of recovery. Outcome measures for the cohort are pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain, fatigue and depression. Finally, a number of prognostic factors for return-to-work and for the development of complaints will be measured.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6828" xml_f="6838" txt_i="2019" txt_f="2029">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6849" xml_f="7159" txt_i="2030" txt_f="2340">The Mom@Work study will provide important information about return-to-work of employees after giving birth.

Despite an abundance of literature about regular RTW and sick leave, little is known about the process of RTW after childbirth. A broad range of factors may contribute to RTW or sick leave, for instance factors like breastfeeding, childcare, social support, work load, distress, health, lack of sleep or health complaints. Therefore, it is important to gain insight into which factors hinder RTW after the end of maternity leave, as well as into the prognostic factors which lead to the development of these complaints.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9215" xml_f="10140" txt_i="3979" txt_f="4904">There are several possible explanations for this high sick leave and postponed RTW postpartum. The postpartum care for women is probably to fragmented. At six weeks postpartum, women have their last contact with the midwife or obstetrician, who have limited time and who give only little or no information about RTW. At Youth Health Care centres only the child's health is considered and due to limited time the mother's health is often neglected. If there are health problems, women consult their general practitioner just before the scheduled maternity leave ends. In addition, these women with postpartum health complaints may not receive timely medical attention of their occupational physician (OP), who is currently not involved until 12–18 weeks postpartum. This may be too late; health complaints may have existed for a considerable time, while early intervention after the onset of complaints seems to be important [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="10171" xml_f="10172" txt_i="4904" txt_f="4905">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10179" xml_f="10180" txt_i="4905" txt_f="4906">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="10212" xml_f="10214" txt_i="4906" txt_f="4908">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10221" xml_f="10293" txt_i="4908" txt_f="4980">], because prognosis for RTW becomes worse due to long-term sick leave [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="10325" xml_f="10327" txt_i="4980" txt_f="4982">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10334" xml_f="10542" txt_i="4982" txt_f="5190">].

This paper describes the design of the Mom@Work study, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and cohort study, conducted at Body@Work, Research Centre Physical Activity, Work and Health, TNO-VUmc in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The Mom@Work study has three aims. The first aim is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an early intervention in reducing sick leave in women after maternity leave in a randomised clinical trial. Our hypothesis is that supervisors who have structural contact with their employees during maternity leave combined with occupational health care, when needed, will be more effective in reducing the number of sick leave days after maternity leave than supervisors who do not. The second aim of the study is to examine which factors contribute to RTW for women after childbirth. The third aim is to examine which factors contribute to the development of the following postpartum complaints: pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain, depression and fatigue. The second and third aim are examined in the cohort study.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="12990" xml_f="13004" txt_i="7528" txt_f="7542">Methods/design</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="13024" xml_f="13036" txt_i="7543" txt_f="7555">Study design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="13047" xml_f="13593" txt_i="7556" txt_f="8102">The study is designed as a simultaneous randomised controlled trial (RCT), to assess effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in reducing postpartum sick leave, and a cohort study, to assess incidence and determinants who contribute to postpartum RTW and to the development of postpartum health complaints.

An assumption was made that six weeks is a good moment to perform the intervention. In The Netherlands, most women have their last consult with their midwife, obstetrician or general practitioner at six weeks postpartum. It is assumed that, in general, women would be physically rehabilitated from delivery after 6 weeks. In The Netherlands, women have between 10–12 weeks of maternity leave after the delivery, before they have to start working again. When problems occur at six weeks after delivery, there is still sufficient time to solve those problems or to start prevention of long-term sick leave after maternity leave. Early identification of employees on sick leave who are at risk for long-term sick leave and work disability is important for starting early interventions. Therefore, it is crucial to seek early contact with those employees [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="46241" xml_f="46242" txt_i="34150" txt_f="34151">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46249" xml_f="46250" txt_i="34151" txt_f="34152">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="46282" xml_f="46284" txt_i="34152" txt_f="34154">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46291" xml_f="46293" txt_i="34154" txt_f="34156">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46300" xml_f="46918" txt_i="34157" txt_f="34775">It may be argued that another time point than six weeks after delivery would be a better moment to intervene.

At six weeks, postpartum it may be difficult to estimate the ability to resume work on an advanced date. Even when a woman does not extend her leave, it may be hard to estimate if one can truly start working again four to six weeks later, because during this period changes can occur to the mother or to the child, or one might feel healthy, but not healthy enough to work.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46925" xml_f="47458" txt_i="34776" txt_f="35309">The supervisor is the person who contacts the participant in the intervention group. In our opinion, the supervisor is the most appropriate person to talk about RTW after maternity leave with their employees. The supervisor usually represents the employer in case the employee gets sick. Most companies have a policy that in case of sickness the supervisor keeps in contact with the employee. Although maternity leave is a special period, because the employee is not sick listed, employees are absent from work for at least 16 weeks.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47465" xml_f="48147" txt_i="35310" txt_f="35992">The relationship between supervisor and employee may be important for the success of the intervention. It is possible that eligible employees refuse to participate, because of a poor relationship with their supervisor. In case employees and supervisors have a 'good' relationship they probably communicate better, than employees and supervisors who have a 'bad' relationship. This better communication may have the same effect as the structural contact in the intervention group, which may lead to a smaller difference between the intervention and control group. Therefore, all women will be asked if they had any conversation with their supervisor about RTW during maternity leave.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48154" xml_f="48663" txt_i="35993" txt_f="36502">For practical reasons, we invited large companies with mostly female employees, and in particular, health care companies. This may have led to selection-bias and the results may probably not be generalisable to all (pregnant) working women. On the other hand, the results of the Mom@Work study will be most interesting for companies were a large number of women is working, and will also give an indication for problems and solutions for smaller companies or companies with a small number of female employees.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48670" xml_f="48978" txt_i="36503" txt_f="36811">This study will provide important information about RTW of employees after giving birth. Results will give insight into the prognosis of sick leave and complaints after childbirth. Also, the role of the supervisor and the occupational physician in prevention of sick leave after childbirth will be clarified.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49000" xml_f="49013" txt_i="36813" txt_f="36826">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49024" xml_f="49065" txt_i="36827" txt_f="36868">EPDS Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49072" xml_f="49115" txt_i="36869" txt_f="36912">4DSQ Four Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49122" xml_f="49150" txt_i="36913" txt_f="36941">HR Human Resource department</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49157" xml_f="49182" txt_i="36942" txt_f="36967">OP Occupational Physician</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49189" xml_f="49230" txt_i="36968" txt_f="37009">OHSP Occupational Health Service Provider</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49237" xml_f="49278" txt_i="37010" txt_f="37051">PPGP Pregnancy-related Pelvic Girdle Pain</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49285" xml_f="49317" txt_i="37052" txt_f="37084">QALY Quality Adjusted Life Years</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49324" xml_f="49364" txt_i="37085" txt_f="37125">RAND-36 36-Item Short Form Health Survey</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49371" xml_f="49402" txt_i="37126" txt_f="37157">RCT Randomised Controlled Trial</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49409" xml_f="49454" txt_i="37158" txt_f="37203">RDQ-24 Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49461" xml_f="49479" txt_i="37204" txt_f="37222">RTW Return-to-Work</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49486" xml_f="49519" txt_i="37223" txt_f="37256">CIS Checklist Individual Strength</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49541" xml_f="49560" txt_i="37258" txt_f="37277">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49571" xml_f="49631" txt_i="37278" txt_f="37338">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49653" xml_f="49675" txt_i="37340" txt_f="37362">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49686" xml_f="50095" txt_i="37363" txt_f="37772">SGMS is performing the data collection and drafted the manuscript.
