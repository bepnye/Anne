The defining feature of this programme was that, unlike in many previous pilots/trials, telemonitoring was provided by the patients’ usual primary care practitioners so that apart from the telemonitoring, the same care was available to control and intervention groups. This approach was shown to be effective in improving the management of BP in people who did not have diabetes. In the trial which was the context for this qualitative study people with type 2 diabetes were asked to telemonitor three risk factors, blood glucose, BP and weight over a period of 9 months. This added complexity to telemonitoring for patients and practitioners, necessitating this qualitative study to examine process and reasons for the effectiveness or otherwise of this complex intervention. All patients had poor blood glucose control at the start of the study, but not necessarily poor BP control.</offsets><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="13628" xml_f="13630" txt_i="6499" txt_f="6501">12</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="13644" xml_f="13723" txt_i="6502" txt_f="6581">A number of qualitative studies from this programme have already been published</offsets><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="13755" xml_f="13760" txt_i="6581" txt_f="6586">27–33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13767" xml_f="13907" txt_i="6586" txt_f="6726"> and strong themes are emerging.

Patient and professional data were initially coded separately and coding was recorded using Nvivo V.7. Initial codes from patients and professionals were grouped into themes and a framework of overarching themes developed, in line with the interpretive descriptive approach, with reference to the purpose of this study. A range of strategies was employed to ensure that the analysis was credible and trustworthy. Constant comparison was used to ensure consistency in coding and negative cases were sought for each coding category. Coding was checked and iteratively refined using paired analysis of transcripts by two researchers (PF and JH). Researcher reflexivity was supported by discussing emerging findings at regular meetings with the wider research group where different explanations were explored and the coding and thematic analysis reviewed and refined. In July 2012, the thematic analysis was presented by PF to a discussion group of researchers who had participated in the Telescot programme. The presentation introduced the themes and illustrative quotes and the whole data set (all the text associated with each code) was made available to the participants.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title><offsets xml_i="23065" xml_f="23072" txt_i="14273" txt_f="14280">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23083" xml_f="23397" txt_i="14281" txt_f="14595">Thirty-six patient participants were approached and 23 interviewed, 16 men and 7 women, mean age 60 years.

It also provided clinicians with a quantitative basis on which to improve the medical management of BP. Some professionals harboured concerns about the potential for the service to increase workload and cost and some expressed a reluctance to move away from traditional exclusive face to face care, but this was not universal. There is need for further refinement of telehealthcare delivery models and technical improvements in telemonitoring systems, as well as wider cultural change on the part of patients and clinicians. More evidence of the beneficial effects of these interventions on patients' self-care motivation and behaviour may help to encourage clinicians to adopt these technologies in routine practice.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the practices and patients who participated in the study.
