In those patients with Plane I fractures, patient-survey scores were not statistically different between the groups, as the average of combined scores were 5.5 points with ultrasound and 6.0 points without ultrasound (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16805" xml_f="16806" txt_i="11375" txt_f="11376">p</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16815" xml_f="17062" txt_i="11376" txt_f="11623">=0.578). Among patients with Plane II fractures, however, patients who underwent blind reduction reported a significantly higher level of dissatisfaction (9.1 points) when compared to that of the ultrasound-assisted closed reduction (6.9 points) (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="17070" xml_f="17071" txt_i="11623" txt_f="11624">p</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="17080" xml_f="17088" txt_i="11624" txt_f="11632">=0.043).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17095" xml_f="17978" txt_i="11633" txt_f="12516">Potential reasons for ultrasound-guided closed reductions increasing patient satisfaction for Plane II fractures are as follows. Fracture patterns are complex and edema is severe in Plane II fractures, which makes it difficult to determine the exact fracture patterns solely with palpation. Ultrasound imaing is helpful in such cases as it allows for a more accurate reduction while decreasing the number of attempts at reduction, which can minimize the damage to soft tissues including the mucous membrane. In addition, ultrasound allows for intraoperative identification of undercorrection and overcorrection of fracture displacement. In this context, our study result suggests that ultrasound-guided closed reduction is superior to blind closed reduction in those patients with Plane II nasal fractures. Future studies should focus on this subset group of nasal fracture patients.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>No potential conflict of interest relevant to this
