In this trial, the experienced surgeons harvested LNs from the fresh specimens immediately after surgery. These data suggested that the number of harvested LNs tended to be much higher for extended dissection than normal D2, but that there was a wide variation even in D2 dissection. The first possible reason for this wide variation is that the number of LNs is different in each patient. However, no literature supports this possibility. The second possible reason is the difference in the gastrectomy type. The extent of nodal dissection was limited in the distal D2 gastrectomy compared with total D2 gastrectomy. The third possible difference is the skill of the surgeon for harvesting the LNs. In the present trial, we set the type of gastrectomy, extent of lymph node dissection, and surgeon’s experience as the stratification factors. Therefore, we will be able to minimize these effects regarding the differences in the standard method and methylene blue-assisted technique.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16530" xml_f="17383" txt_i="9658" txt_f="10511">The hypothesis of the present study is that the methylene blue-assisted technique is superior to the conventional method, and is associated with a 25% reduction in the ratio of harvested lymph nodes/time (minutes). In general, the statistical hypothesis is determined by considering the balance between the risks and benefits of the standard arm and the test arm. However, there is no risk associated with the methylene blue-assisted technique for the patients. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the methylene blue-assisted technique is effective even when the difference in the ratio of harvested lymph nodes/time is very small. However, it is not practical to statistically prove the significance of small differences. Considering the practical and acceptable sample sizes based on the previous data, we determined our statistical hypothesis.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17390" xml_f="17873" txt_i="10512" txt_f="10995">In this trial, the primary endpoint is the ratio of the number of harvested LNs per time period (minutes).
