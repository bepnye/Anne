Women will be recruited from four maternity centres in England. Community midwives complete a short training module before delivering the intervention. In the intervention, midwives weigh women, set maximum weight limits for weight gain at each antenatal appointment and ask women to monitor their weight at home. Themaximum weight limit is adjusted by the midwife at each antenatal appointment if women have exceeded their maximum weight gain limit set at their previous appointment. The intervention will be compared with usual antenatal care.

In summary, the intervention proved feasible to deliver and was considered acceptable by pregnant women and community midwives. Data showed a modest but promising difference favouring the intervention group in the percentage of women exceeding the IOM recommended weight gain for their early BMI category (23.5 % versus 29.4 %) at 38 weeks of pregnancy. The trial was not planned to be large enough to estimate the difference in the proportion achieving healthy weight gain as this is the purpose of a definitive effectiveness trial. There was no evidence the intervention caused undue anxiety in the intervention group relative to usual care. In the usual care group we found no evidence of intervention contamination where midwives gave the intervention to this group. The intervention group reported higher total physical activity scores at 38 weeks of pregnancy than usual care. The intervention group also reported participation in substantially more vigorous intensity physical activity (double the rate) than usual care at 38 weeks gestation.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title><offsets xml_i="25022" xml_f="25068" txt_i="16093" txt_f="16139">Views of community midwives: feasibility study</offsets></title><p id="Par26"><offsets xml_i="25090" xml_f="25704" txt_i="16140" txt_f="16754">Most midwives commented that they had had some initial apprehension about delivering the intervention because it was something new, but that over time it became second nature.

Women felt the intervention was useful in helping them to be more aware and vigilant about their eating and physical activity and they appreciated having a target weight set by the midwife. Women did not have any concerns about discussing their weight with their midwife and the majority felt that regular weighing during pregnancy was important and worthwhile and some had recommended self-weighing to others.

Collectively these tasks are important for several reasons. We learnt from our feasibility trial that we needed to place greater emphasis on women self managing their weight between appointments and have established strategies to help achieve this. There are gaps of several weeks between some antenatal appointments (e.g. between 16–24 weeks of pregnancy) so it is important for women to be aware of their weight gain during these intervals, so that lapses can be identified early and correction implemented. The intervention seeks to encourage women to work in partnership with their midwife rather than relying entirely on the midwife for feedback before taking action.

Pregnant women are routinely seen by their midwife at 38 weeks of pregnancy and they will be weighed at this appointment for the purpose of this study. At recruitment all women will have a sticker inserted into their hand held pregnancy notes on the page where midwives normally record routine medical information; weight and weeks of pregnancy will be recorded on this sticker. Women who do not attend their 38 week appointment will be contacted and alternative arrangements for them to be weighed will be made.

As women will see their community midwife weekly until the end of pregnancy after 38 weeks, this provides several more opportunities to catch up with women after 38 weeks if women miss the 38 week appointment or the midwife does not weigh women. As a consequence, we believe loss to follow up will be low. At 38 weeks, the study team will post a questionnaire to women to assess depression and anxiety, physical activity and diet quality. The team will send one postal reminder to non responders.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title><offsets xml_i="49049" xml_f="49075" txt_i="36395" txt_f="36421">Post study data collection</offsets></title><p id="Par66"><offsets xml_i="49097" xml_f="50065" txt_i="36422" txt_f="37390">The weight gain charts will be retrieved from the pregnancy notes after women have had their baby.

This study has design strengths as well as some limitations. We have followed best practice in designing the randomisation procedures and implementing concealment of allocation. In common with practically all trials of behavioural interventions, it was impossible to blind either participants or midwives to which group they are in. However, it is unlikely that knowledge of group allocation will particularly affect other maternity care offered to women that might prevent excessive weight gain. Midwives rarely engage on this topic in routine care and part of the impact of the intervention of weighing women, giving feedback, and setting maximum weight gain limits is to prompt discussion of the importance of healthy weight gain and how to achieve it in the intervention group. In this trial, our primary outcome is assessed by midwives who are not blind to treatment allocation. In deciding to do this, we faced a trade-off between participant and midwife burden and achieving high rates of follow-up on the one hand and between blinded follow-up on the other. We believe that women are highly motivated to attend maternity care and are much more likely to be motivated and able to attend for this than they would be for blinded follow-up for weighing by a researcher. As weight is objective, we think the risk of bias from this compromise is low and less than the risk of attrition bias that we judged more likely trying to implement blinded follow-up, particularly for the control group for whom being weighed may not seem that important. By declaring our outcomes in advance and writing a detailed statistical analysis plan we have protected against selective reporting bias.</offsets></p><p id="Par73"><offsets xml_i="57424" xml_f="58370" txt_i="44144" txt_f="45090">A lack of high quality trials has hindered the development of recommendations for clinical practice in the UK and many other countries. The proposed trial will test an intervention that can be delivered at scale as part of routine antenatal care incurring minimal additional costs, using the professional expertise of community midwives but not requiring specialist weight management skills. Given that it is impossible to predict who will gain excessive weight, we need interventions that need to be applied to all women, implying that they must be low intensity and inexpensive. If an intervention such as this was shown to be effective, it seems likely that it could immediately become part of routine maternity care at a small cost, without increasing substantially antenatal appointment length. Other than our pilot RCT, this is the first trial to investigate the benefits of setting weight limits and regular weighing by community midwives.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>APGAR</term><def><p id="Par6">Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par7">Body Mass Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p id="Par8">Good Clinical Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IOM</term><def><p id="Par9">Institute of Medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>kg</term><def><p id="Par10">kilograms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICE</term><def><p id="Par11">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRES</term><def><p id="Par12">National Research Ethics Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par13">Randomised Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par14">Standard Deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSC</term><def><p id="Par15">Trial Steering Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p id="Par16">United Kingdom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USA</term><def><p id="Par17">United States of America</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors’ contributions</bold></p><p>AD developed the initial idea for the study with assistance from PA, SJ, KJ, LM, and AL.
