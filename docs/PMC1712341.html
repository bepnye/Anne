Other considerations were that assistance and support for modifying behaviours such as smoking might be more effective prior to pregnancy, given the increased anxiety that may occur in early pregnancy. Before assessment of gestational age by ultrasound scanning became common, there were also concerns that a 'natural' cycle and a reliable date for the last menstrual period needed to be re-established before conception; thus women were advised to replace hormonal contraception or intrauterine devices with barrier methods for several months before trying to conceive.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7549" xml_f="7605" txt_i="4062" txt_f="4118">Pre-pregnancy Information and Counselling Service (PPIS)</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7616" xml_f="7738" txt_i="4119" txt_f="4241">The setting in which the trial was planned was a newly established pre-pregnancy service (PPIS) in inner urban Melbourne [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="7769" xml_f="7770" txt_i="4241" txt_f="4242">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7777" xml_f="8680" txt_i="4242" txt_f="5145">]. It was initiated by two obstetricians from a University Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, in association with a Community Health Centre, and funded within a new, national, community health programme. The primary role of the PPIS was to provide a 'universal' walk-in service locally, and a secondary school health education component. It also accepted referrals and provided a telephone information service. One fulltime, experienced, midwife, subsequently increased to 1.5 positions, staffed the PPIS, with support from the first author. The PPIS self-referral and telephone service attracted in the main well educated and socially advantaged women, who were not living in the locality. This finding, together with the policy that evaluation was to have a key role in services funded by the new community health program, contributed to the development of the pre-pregnancy intervention trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8687" xml_f="8715" txt_i="5146" txt_f="5174">Objectives of the PPIS trial</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8722" xml_f="9027" txt_i="5175" txt_f="5480">1.

The PPIS midwife collected women's names and addresses weekly from the MCH nurses, and recorded whether an interpreter would be needed, and for what language. Women's names were then entered into the trial logbook where the sequence of allocations (derived from random number tables by the first author and utilising balanced block randomisation in blocks of two, four or six) was already listed. Thus allocation occurred before the PPIS midwife had met the woman. The PPIS midwife contacted women whose details had been provided and arranged a home visit to confirm participation.

It demonstrated that it was feasible to test a pre-pregnancy intervention using a 'gold standard' design within socially disadvantaged communities, including women on low incomes and culturally diverse women, incorporating the intervention into an existing population-wide service. It provided a model for joint action between four community health services. It also identified issues relevant to the planning of future trials. Data on the high proportion of participants who turned out to be ineligible or lost to the study are likely to be relevant to other population based pre-pregnancy interventions.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33500" xml_f="33510" txt_i="27639" txt_f="27649">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33521" xml_f="33626" txt_i="27650" txt_f="27755">Despite wide-ranging support for pre-pregnancy interventions to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42"><offsets xml_i="33658" xml_f="33660" txt_i="27755" txt_f="27757">42</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33667" xml_f="33756" txt_i="27757" txt_f="27846">] none of the published trials so far, nor this trial, has identified beneficial effects.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33778" xml_f="33797" txt_i="27848" txt_f="27867">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33808" xml_f="33868" txt_i="27868" txt_f="27928">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33890" xml_f="33912" txt_i="27930" txt_f="27952">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33923" xml_f="34140" txt_i="27953" txt_f="28170">JL designed the study, carried out the data analysis and drafted the paper.
