One strategy suggests that, if effective, interventions to improve self-management behavior will also reduce DD, since the worries and concerns regarding poor disease management will be reduced as well. Programs to improve self-management have been shown to be effective, can be inexpensive, and are easily available for large patient populations (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><offsets xml_i="8468" xml_f="8470" txt_i="3643" txt_f="3645">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8477" xml_f="8646" txt_i="3645" txt_f="3814">), but their direct effects on reducing DD have not been demonstrated.

The reductions in DD are most apparent when viewing the categorical data. Approximately 33% of patients who reported high DD at baseline and 60% of patients who reported moderate DD at baseline reported little or no DD at 12 months. More specifically, we find that interventions that target enhanced self-management (CASM) reduce DD significantly but that DD-specific interventions (CAPS) may be necessary for patients with initially high levels of RD. RD generates the most distress and displays the greatest distress reduction as a result of intervention. Thus, for those with initially high RD (mean score ≥3), which is a significant portion of the type 2 diabetes population (31.2%) (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"><offsets xml_i="30073" xml_f="30075" txt_i="22309" txt_f="22311">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30082" xml_f="30203" txt_i="22311" txt_f="22432">), programs that focus on improving disease management alone may be insufficient; a specific focus on RD may be required.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30210" xml_f="30404" txt_i="22433" txt_f="22627">We also find in general that interventions decrease DD, especially RD, the most for patients with initially high DD.

Furthermore, the pace of reduction in RD as a result of intervention appears different for older and younger patients: older patients show significant reductions in the early phases of the intervention, whereas younger patients respond later. This suggests that younger patients, who may be managing more non–disease-related stresses and life problems (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"><offsets xml_i="31134" xml_f="31136" txt_i="23270" txt_f="23272">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31143" xml_f="31388" txt_i="23272" txt_f="23517">), may require greater exposure to distress-reduction programs over time than older patients.

Although these findings bear replication, among DD patients it may take longer for the behavioral contingencies that support medication taking to emerge than for diet and exercise.

This finding provides evidence that Leap Ahead, a minimal general health and diabetes education intervention (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"><offsets xml_i="33723" xml_f="33725" txt_i="25558" txt_f="25560">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33732" xml_f="34695" txt_i="25560" txt_f="26523">), is for many patients as effective in reducing distress as CASM and CAPS. Taking about the same time as CASM and CAPS, Leap Ahead did not require, suggest, or encourage patients to change behavior; its goal was only to provide attention and modest health-related information delivery. Excluding initially highly distressed patients, for whom more distressed–focused interventions may be necessary, these findings suggest that most distressed patients are highly responsive to clinical staff attention, concern, and support both with and without the structure of formal programs to change behavior or enhance DD-related problem solving. Reducing distress, therefore, may have less to do with providing patients with programs of action and behavioral change and more to do with health care professionals listening to, understanding, acknowledging, and normalizing DD so that patients’ internal resources can become freer of internal distress–related constraints (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="34726" xml_f="34727" txt_i="26523" txt_f="26524">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34734" xml_f="34735" txt_i="26524" txt_f="26525">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><offsets xml_i="34767" xml_f="34769" txt_i="26525" txt_f="26527">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34776" xml_f="34777" txt_i="26527" txt_f="26528">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="34809" xml_f="34811" txt_i="26528" txt_f="26530">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34818" xml_f="34819" txt_i="26530" txt_f="26531">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"><offsets xml_i="34851" xml_f="34853" txt_i="26531" txt_f="26533">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34860" xml_f="35019" txt_i="26533" txt_f="26692">).

This investigation showed that DD is highly responsive to intervention and that although interventions that improve self-management can also reduce distress, distress-specific interventions need to be delivered for patients with initially high levels of DD. Greater attention to DD within the context of self-management improvement programs and general clinical care is warranted.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
