While several care models have shown effectiveness in achieving various outcomes among these patients, it remains unclear what care model is most effective in improving blood pressure control in primary care. In this prospective study, 54 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and blood pressure of &gt;140/90 identified through the registry, were randomized into three groups. Group A attended a nurse educator-conducted class on diabetes and hypertension, group B attended the same class and was asked to monitor their home blood pressure using provided device, and group C served as control (usual care). Of the 24 subjects who completed the study, only 20% achieved the target blood pressure of &lt;130/80 and there was no statistical difference in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures among the three groups (p &gt; 0.05). Efforts to intensify management of hypertension among type 2 diabetes patients did not result in better blood pressure control compared to usual care. Studies looking into factors which limit patients’ participation in group classes and determining patients’ preferences in disease management would be helpful in ensuring success of any chronic disease management program.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>management</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>diabetes mellitus type 2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4759" xml_f="4769" txt_i="1335" txt_f="1345">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4780" xml_f="5116" txt_i="1346" txt_f="1682">Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature mortality among patients with diabetes, with heart disease accounting for more than half of these deaths.

Using 130/80 as cut-off, 100% of 20 patients had blood pressure of greater than 130/80 with one reading but only 45% was consistently above target with two out of three readings. At a cut-off of 140/90, 50% were consistently above target with two readings. With 150/90 as cut-off, 100% was above it at first reading and 65% was still above target in two of three readings.

Our study failed to show a statistical difference in mean blood pressure readings after six months among the subjects randomized into three study groups. Those randomized into a more intensive management; ie, groups A and B did not have significant improvement in blood pressure control compared to those under usual care. Different care delivery models (usual care plus education, usual care plus education and home blood pressure self monitoring, or usual care alone) did not result in varying degrees of blood pressure improvement among diabetes patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Given our small sample size, it was not surprising to see no statistically significant differences among the study groups. We were also underpowered as only half of the randomized participants completed the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21401" xml_f="22218" txt_i="16174" txt_f="16991">Seven out of the 19 participants who were randomized to group B returned after six months with recorded home blood pressure readings, five subjects had mean blood pressure readings below 130/80. Outcome blood pressure readings in this study were obtained during a return clinic visit using standard protocol. Only two study participants in group B met target pressure on return clinic blood pressure check. This observation is consistent with previously reported discrepancies between office and home blood pressure readings, home or ambulatory readings potentially being more accurate. Evaluating the achievement of recommended blood pressure among diabetics with uncontrolled hypertension through different delivery care models using home blood pressure recordings may therefore be a more effective outcome measure.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22225" xml_f="22813" txt_i="16992" txt_f="17580">Self-management is an essential component of chronic disease model. We failed to see a trend towards increased self-activation among participants in the practice model arms. Participation in education and tracking blood pressure readings at home did not increase patient’s likelihood of seeing a health care provider more often than those under conventional care. A characteristic defined as “I can take charge” and reflected in an individual’s proactive behavior of seeking more information from health care providers has been equated with high self-efficacy and adherence to medication.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-5-705"><offsets xml_i="22856" xml_f="22858" txt_i="17580" txt_f="17582">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22865" xml_f="23005" txt_i="17582" txt_f="17722"> In this study, we incorporated chronic disease model components such as use of registry and allied professionals to achieve our stated aim.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-vhrm-5-705"><offsets xml_i="23048" xml_f="23050" txt_i="17722" txt_f="17724">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23057" xml_f="23279" txt_i="17724" txt_f="17946"> It was apparent that without the component of patient self-management, attainment of target blood pressure would be difficult.

Despite its negative outcome, our study is the first of such kind. Our study was limited by its lack of power due to a small sample size and short follow-up of six months.

Given our study results, the next step perhaps is to focus on identifying factors that create barriers to patients’ participation into care initiatives and surveying patients regarding their preferences in care delivery and disease management. Valuable data can then be obtained that may help guide educators and practitioners into structuring a practice care model that enhances patients’ engagement in their health and deliver efficient care with sustained outcomes.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this
