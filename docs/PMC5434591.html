Migration of implants as measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) can predict future loosening. This migration is associated with bone resorption. Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to receptors on osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts. This prevents osteoclast formation, resulting in less bone resorption in cortical and trabecular bone. We investigated whether denosumab can reduce migration of TKR, as measured with RSA.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4052" xml_f="4072" txt_i="565" txt_f="585">Patients and methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4083" xml_f="4568" txt_i="586" txt_f="1071">In this 2-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 50 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were treated with an injection of either denosumab (60 mg) or placebo 1 day after knee replacement surgery and again after 6 months.

This suggests that the risk of loosening was reduced by the treatment. The total 10-year revision rate for cemented knees is normally around 4%, but revision for aseptic loosening amounts to only 1% (The Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register 2015). It has been estimated that the 5-year revision rate increases by 7 percentage points (CI: 4.7–9.5) for every 1 mm increase in MTPM during the first postoperative year (Pijls et al. </offsets><xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18008" xml_f="18012" txt_i="11735" txt_f="11739">2012</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18019" xml_f="18411" txt_i="11739" txt_f="12131">). Assuming a linear relationship, our results would indicate that denosumab can eliminate the need for most revisions due to aseptic loosening. This estimation, however, is likely to be overoptimistic. The relationship between migration and the risk of loosening is not linear. It is even possible that there is a dichotomy in the data, similar to that for acetabular cups (Aspenberg et al. </offsets><xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18442" xml_f="18446" txt_i="12131" txt_f="12135">2008</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18453" xml_f="18698" txt_i="12135" txt_f="12380">). Therefore, reducing median values is probably less important than reducing the number of patients with excessive migration. Such an endpoint, however, would require a much larger number of patients than is normally feasible with an RSA study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18705" xml_f="19016" txt_i="12381" txt_f="12692">MTPM is the length of the translation vector of the point in a rigid body that has the greatest motion. MTPM always has a positive value and is not normally distributed. We used MTPM because the possible effect of a drug on migration is most likely to be detected at the point of maximum motion (Valstar et al. </offsets><xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="19048" xml_f="19052" txt_i="12692" txt_f="12696">2005</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19059" xml_f="19272" txt_i="12696" txt_f="12909">). This might explain why most measures of translation and rotation did not show any statistically significant differences. The treatment effect was apparent after 6 months, and after that the changes were small (</offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003"><offsets xml_i="19305" xml_f="19313" txt_i="12909" txt_f="12917">Figure 3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19320" xml_f="19546" txt_i="12917" txt_f="13143">). Also, MTPM at 12 to 24 months was rather similar between the groups, apparently because the effect of denosumab mainly occurred before that time period. Hence, it is likely that the second dose of denosumab was unnecessary.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19553" xml_f="19670" txt_i="13144" txt_f="13261">The difference in response between the anabolic drug teri­paratide, shown in our accompanying paper in this issue of </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="19678" xml_f="19695" txt_i="13261" txt_f="13278">Acta Orthopaedica</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="19704" xml_f="19902" txt_i="13278" txt_f="13476">, and antiresorptive drugs such as bisphosphonates and denosumab suggest that resorption plays a more important role during the postoperative course than any deficit in bone formation (Ledin et al. </offsets><xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="19933" xml_f="19937" txt_i="13476" txt_f="13480">2017</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19944" xml_f="20084" txt_i="13480" txt_f="13620">). The primary variable of the teriparatide trial was migration from 12 to 24 months. This choice was motivated by the study of Ryd et al. (</offsets><xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="20116" xml_f="20120" txt_i="13620" txt_f="13624">1995</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20127" xml_f="20296" txt_i="13624" txt_f="13793">), where this time period was described as having the highest predictive value. However, later studies have emphasized earlier time periods for prediction (Pijls et al. </offsets><xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="20328" xml_f="20332" txt_i="13793" txt_f="13797">2012</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20339" xml_f="20584" txt_i="13797" txt_f="14042">), so we changed the primary effect variable when we came to the denosumab trial.

However, due to the different mechanisms of action, it is theoretically possible that denosumab may be of value in the treatment of established loosening (Aspenberg et al. </offsets><xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="20988" xml_f="20992" txt_i="14409" txt_f="14413">2011</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20999" xml_f="21001" txt_i="14413" txt_f="14415">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21008" xml_f="21494" txt_i="14416" txt_f="14902">The patient-reported function and symptoms (KOOS) were similar between the groups. This was to be expected. Migration is thought to influence the risk of loosening in the long run, and even if the loosening process starts postoperatively, it probably remains subclinical for several years.
