This study aimed to examine the effect of biofeedback treatment on headache activity, anxiety, and depression in Korean female patients with migraine headache. Patients were randomized into the treatment group (n=17) and monitoring group (n=15). Mood states including anxiety and depression, and psychophysiological variables such as mean skin temperature of the patients were compared with those of the normal controls (n=21). We found greater treatment response rate (defined as ≥50% reduction in headache index) in patients with biofeedback-assisted autogenic training than in monitoring group. The scores on the anxiety and depression scales in the patients receiving biofeedback-assisted autogenic training decreased after the biofeedback treatment. Moreover, the decrease in their anxiety levels was significantly related to the treatment outcome. This result suggests that the biofeedback-assisted autogenic training is effective for the treatment of migraine and its therapeutic effect is closely related to the improvement of the anxiety level.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Migraine</kwd><kwd>Biofeedback</kwd><kwd>Autogenic Training</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title><offsets xml_i="4867" xml_f="4879" txt_i="1184" txt_f="1196">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4890" xml_f="5024" txt_i="1197" txt_f="1331">Migraine is a highly prevalent illness, and women of reproductive ages are more affected by it than men or women in other age groups (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="5055" xml_f="5056" txt_i="1331" txt_f="1332">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5063" xml_f="5253" txt_i="1332" txt_f="1522">).

For the first 15-20 min, after collecting the headache diary data, the patients were rated on psychological variables and headache severity. The patients were trained to increase their skin temperature by an experienced biofeedback therapist for about 15 min according to the procedures described in a treatment manual. During the last 15 min, they were instructed to continue the relaxation exercise by themselves, while listening to a prerecorded tape.

The anxiety and depression scores in the migraine patients were reduced after 4 weeks of biofeedback treatment. Furthermore, the reduction in anxiety level after the biofeedback treatment was related to the treatment response of the patients. To our knowledge, there have been no reports about the association between mood states, including anxiety and depression, and improvements in headache activity in migraine patients receiving biofeedback treatment. Our result is also consistent with the finding of previous studies (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"><offsets xml_i="17485" xml_f="17487" txt_i="12188" txt_f="12190">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17494" xml_f="17495" txt_i="12190" txt_f="12191">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"><offsets xml_i="17527" xml_f="17529" txt_i="12191" txt_f="12193">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17536" xml_f="17790" txt_i="12193" txt_f="12447">) that mood states might affect the experience of pain through the cognitive processing of nociceptive information, although this hypothesis has not been directly examined in headache patients.

Firstly, the time period of the study was short. Migraine is an illness with a fluctuating course in which the symptoms wax and wane, and psychophysiological treatment may have a delayed effect. Secondly, the severity of headache in the recruited patients was relatively low and the patients in this study may not represent the general population with migraine headache. Finally, our sample size was relatively small. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first controlled study to examine the efficacy of biofeedback treatment and the relationship between mood states and headache activity in Korean migraine patients.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20123" xml_f="20629" txt_i="14568" txt_f="15074">In conclusion, biofeedback treatment was found to cause an improvement of headache and mood states such as anxiety and depression in female migraine patients. In addition, the reduction of anxiety level was related to the biofeedback treatment response. These results suggest that biofeedback treatment can be an effective non-pharmacological treatment for migraine patients and that the improvement of the anxiety states afforded by biofeedback treatment may play a key role in reducing headache activity.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This study was supported by a grant from the <funding-source>Korea
