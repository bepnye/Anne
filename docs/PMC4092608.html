Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is effective and is currently used for coagulation factor replacement, carrying a risk of volume overload, transmission of infective agents and being time consuming. Variable and frequently low potency of clotting factors results in minor haemostatic effects compared with prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC), which are considered very effective and safe.

PCC was supplied as 500 IU factor IX (20 ml) vials. The dose was calculated on the basis of body weight, the initial INR and the target INR aiming at an INR of 1.5 after protamine. One-half of this dose was administered before the start of CPB. After weaning from CPB and protamine, the second half-dose was given in order to reach a postoperative INR ≤ 1.5. In case the INR value was still too high a further dose of PPSB was given. In the FFP group, each patient received 4 units: one-half of this dose was given before CPB and the other half after CPB. Additional FFP was given until the INR had reached a satisfactory level. In cases of poor response and/or if there was a danger of volume overload, PCC was given. A portable coagulation monitor (CoaguChek) was used for INR measurements. Blood sampling was preoperative (T-1), preincision (T0), preadministration and postadministration before CPB (T1, T2), during CPB at 15 and 45 min (T3, T4), at the end of CPB (T5), after protamine administration (T6), and 15 and 60 min and 3 and 16 hours post-CB (T7–T10).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="4645" xml_f="4895" txt_i="1984" txt_f="2234">Analyses performed were: INR, PT, Hct, ACT, aPTT, ad factors II, VII, IX, X and FV.
