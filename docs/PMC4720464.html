Interest in CRP in monitoring infection has increased since it was announced that CRP above 140 mg / L, as determined in the third or fourth postoperative day is a good indicator for complications in colorectal surgery (</offsets><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="20129" xml_f="20130" txt_i="14995" txt_f="14996">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20137" xml_f="20858" txt_i="14996" txt_f="15711">). Besides shorter hospital stays, faster establishment of peristalsis, and economic benefits, the study showed that coffee drinkers had significantly lower postoperative value of C-reactive protein in relation to tea consumers(p &lt;0.01) while the value of C-reactive protein levels greater than 140 mg / l represent the cut-off value. And after stratification by type of surgery, coffee drinkers had significantly lower levels of CRP in each procedure. In all patients (consumers of coffee and tea), there was a significant positive correlation between postoperative time reporting stools and the value of CRP; In other words, if the operative stool later occurred, the more the values of CRP were higher (p &lt;0.05).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20865" xml_f="22526" txt_i="15712" txt_f="17361">Coffee and tea group in the study are quite balanced, because there was no difference in the consumers of coffee and tea in anything (age, sex, comorbidity, smoking, duration of surgery, ASA score, frequency of administration, transfusion, incidence stay in JINJ). The tumor of the right colon was significantly more frequent in subjects who were tea consumers (p &lt;0.05). Besides him, one more observed difference was at the level of “stapler-manuel” anastomosis, stapler anastomosis is common in coffee group (p &lt;0.01). Therefore, the study analyzed: CRP, reporting stools, length of hospitalization and the incidence of postoperative complications in stapler and the manual anastomosis, as well as colon cancer and other diseases, which were intended to prove that the coffee itself reduces CRP, hospitalization, or it may stapler or a tumor of the colon “problematic” in itself. The concentration of CRP was significantly lower (p &lt;0.01), and hospitalization was significantly shortest in stapler anastomosis (p &lt;0.01). Also, the concentration of CRP was significantly lower and the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in the right colon tumors than in other illnesses. This means that stapler anastomosis safer, and right colon tumor more problematic than other diseases. Then, CRP and hospitalization in the right colon with coffee consumers were compared. As a result, we found that in patients with tumors of the right colon, concentration of CRP was significantly lower, and length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the coffee consumers. Here by, we have shown that coffee has effect even in tumors of the colon.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22533" xml_f="23068" txt_i="17362" txt_f="17897">One of the possible measures in resolving deferred functions of the gastrointestinal tract after colorectal resection involves administration of drugs such as alvimopan who µ-opioid receptor agonists. Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the impact the alvimopan had in 654 patients after resection of the small and large intestine.

The time for establishing the first bowel movement and stool after resection of the colon and rectum was significantly shorter in the group of patients who consumed coffee compared to the group that consumed the tea which took less time, and was shorter by 15 hours. Coffee consumption in patients with resection of the colon and rectum reduces total hospital stay, and total hospital costs. Faster establishment of normal function of the GI tract is not produced negative repercussions. On the contrary, the overall morbidity in the group that consumed coffee is lower than in the group that consumed tea.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
