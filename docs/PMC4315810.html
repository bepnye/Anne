The results of this study have clear implications for regulations on tobacco packaging, currently under development in the UK. Standardized packaging has the potential to reduce the number of young people who start and subsequently become addicted to smoking each year, via the influence of health warnings. In concert with previous eye-tracking studies, the results suggest that standardized packaging would increase the salience, and thus the impact, of text and pictorial health warnings on non-smokers.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title><offsets xml_i="32226" xml_f="32243" txt_i="24930" txt_f="24947">Author statements</offsets></title><sec id="sec7.1"><title><offsets xml_i="32275" xml_f="32291" txt_i="24948" txt_f="24964">Ethical approval</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32302" xml_f="32598" txt_i="24965" txt_f="25261">Ethical approval (dated 26.03.13) was granted (following light-touch procedures designed for minimal-risk social-scientific research with normal adult volunteers) by the Research Ethics Committee of the Department of Psychology, City University London.

Mean proportion of viewing time spent fixating within the warning-label and branding regions of interest, or in ‘other’ locations (which includes samples where no eye position could be determined, e.g. blinks).
