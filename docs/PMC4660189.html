Logistic regression modelling 28-day mortality, adjusting for factorial design, was to be produced at interim time points. Treatment arms were to be stopped if the two-sided p-value was &lt;0.001. Both benefit and harm (symmetrical stopping boundary) treatment effects were evaluated. This conservative method was formulated because the treatments were already in practice and so convincing evidence to stop early was needed. The treatment interaction of prednisolone and pentixoifylline was assessed at the 10% significance level. If significant, the factorial design assumption was to be removed prior to interim analysis. The stopping rules would then be applied as described.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5049" xml_f="5060" txt_i="1451" txt_f="1462">Application</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5071" xml_f="5337" txt_i="1463" txt_f="1729">An independent data monitoring committee assessed these stopping rules after 200, 400 and 800 patients had reached the primary endpoint.
