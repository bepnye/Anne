However, although these treatments suppress replication of HIV, they do not eliminate HIV entirely. One current area of HIV research focuses on whether and how it is possible to take a break from antiretroviral therapy—which is very toxic—and at the same time achieve very low levels of HIV. Some research groups are also interested in whether and how it might be possible to eliminate the virus completely from the bloodstream and immune system of infected people, and therefore achieve a long-term cure. One such approach involves administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2, a hormone involved in the immune response), in the hope that IL-2 will boost the ability of the body's own immune system to eliminate HIV. Various candidate HIV vaccines have also been designed that, it is hoped, will prime the immune system to make it more receptive to IL-2. In the trial reported here, the researchers wanted to test whether IL-2 administration either alone or in combination with an HIV vaccine, ALVAC vCP1452, would maintain low levels of HIV in the blood of people who had stopped taking antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, participants in the trial were assigned to one of four arms: a placebo version of the vaccine only; vaccine only; placebo version of vaccine plus IL-2; or vaccine plus IL-2. The investigators planned to recruit 92 people into the trial who would be given the various interventions tested here for 12 weeks, while also receiving HAART (step 1). Then, HAART was stopped for 12 weeks (step 2), or, in some people, for 24 weeks if HIV levels remained below a certain threshold (step 3).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9286" xml_f="9287" txt_i="3662" txt_f="3663">

The researchers did not see any significant differences between the treatment groups in any of the three primary outcome measures, which were the proportion of people with undetectable HIV levels during step 2; the average HIV levels during the last four weeks of step 2; and the proportion of people eligible to continue to step 3. Therefore, the investigators concluded that neither the ALVAC vaccine nor IL-2 alone or in combination with each other, prevented HIV from replicating when HAART was stopped.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9991" xml_f="9992" txt_i="4348" txt_f="4349">

A further strength in the design of this trial is the use of a placebo vaccine to control for ALVAC vCP1452, which enabled participants and investigators to be blinded to whether a patient received vaccine or placebo. However, a placebo was not used as a control for IL-2 because patients often experience characteristic side effects to this treatment. Limitations in the design of this study include the small numbers of participants, which means that the trial did not have enough power to exclude the possibility of a small effect of IL-2 or vaccine on HIV levels in blood. The follow-up in the trial was also short, and efficacy outcomes did not include measures that patients might consider important, such as survival.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10972" xml_f="10973" txt_i="5310" txt_f="5311">

Accordingly, even though the dose of IL-2 was low enough to avoid most of the severe systemic constitutional signs and symptoms of inflammation associated with higher IL-2 doses, it is clear that low-dose IL-2 administration is hampered by the fact that it must be injected daily, and still causes both local and systemic inflammation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51718" xml_f="52174" txt_i="38861" txt_f="39317">With regard to AEs, it is worthy of mention that only 13% of the AEs were higher than grade I, and there were no grade IV AEs or SAEs.

</p><p>KAS, ML, SB, CW, and JR designed the study. KAS, SA, ZP, AS, ML, and CW analyzed the data. KAS, LKR, AS, and PB enrolled patients. SA, ZP, LKR, SB, and CW wrote the paper. SA monitored the immune responses of clinical trial participants. ZP was involved in laboratory evaluations. LKR conducted protocol-specified visits to collect clinical data from study participants and manage adverse events. SB acted as the research pharmacist for this trial, which involved designing the randomization scheme, randomizing patients to treatment, calculating and preparing treatment doses, and blinding the vaccine doses. CW designed experiments and analyzed data associated with the use of the CPLp assay.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="n105" fn-type="current-aff"><p>a¤ Current address: Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, New York, United States of America</p></fn><fn id="n106" fn-type="current-aff"><p>b¤ Current address: Columbia University Medical Center, Neurological Institute, New York, New York, United States of America</p></fn><fn id="n103" fn-type="COI-statement"><p>

<bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported in part via a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID; R01-AI-51181) to KAS as an investigator-initiated clinical trial, and by the Weill Medical College General Clinical Research Center (M01-RR00047). The Chiron Corporation supplied Proleukin; Sanofi Pasteur supplied ALVAC vCP1452 and placebo, and BD Biosciences supplied reagents and expertise for flow cytometry. Study corporate sponsors contributed to the study design, analysis and interpretation of data, and the decision to submit it for publication. No financial support was received by the study investigators from the corporate sponsors. As principal investigator, KAS had full access to all of the data in this study and takes complete responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.</p></fn></fn-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CPLp</term><def><p>cytokine-producing lymphocyte precursor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DTH</term><def><p>delayed type hypersensitivity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DTI</term><def><p>diagnostic treatment interruption</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAART</term><def><p>highly active antiretroviral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>[HIV]</term><def><p>HIV RNA concentration (copies/ml)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-2</term><def><p>interleukin 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IFN-γ</term><def><p>interferon gamma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LTNP</term><def><p>long-term nonprogressor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p>standard error of the mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF-α</term><def><p>tumor necrosis factor alpha</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="pctr-0020005-b001"><element-citation publication-type="journal">
