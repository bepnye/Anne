This provided information on cost in relation to the different productivity levels of different groups. The secondary outcomes were: the direct cost per hour of patient contact and the indirect costs of care per hour of patient contact. All the primary and secondary costs excluded educational costs, as these can be treated as sunk costs or retrospective costs that have been incurred and cannot be recovered. The cost of training all medical professionals is substantial because the level of knowledge and skill required for ED roles requires acquisition of high-quality, costly education and practice.

We have demonstrated that the cost of substituting routine care by doctors with a predominantly ESP or ENP workforce is likely to be at best equivalent in cost with a high likelihood of greater cost from the perspective of the NHS, the patient and society. The cost per hour of patient contact for the different professional groups was Â£80.91 for doctors, Â£89.71 for ESPs and Â£109.81 for ENPs. However, an economic analysis undertaken from the perspective of the NHS with costs limited to hospital-based secondary care changes this economic argument. In this context both the ESP and ENP are likely to be equivalent in cost to routine care, and the likelihood of costing less is greater than in the previous comparison. The direct cost per hour of patient contact was Â£60.96 for doctors, Â£52.48 for ESPs and Â£55.21 for ENPs. It is therefore the indirect costs associated with care provided by ESPs and ENPs that make these options for management of soft tissue injuries in ED in England less economically attractive.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s10b"><title><offsets xml_i="31308" xml_f="31332" txt_i="19692" txt_f="19716">Strengths and weaknesses</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31343" xml_f="31638" txt_i="19717" txt_f="20012">This study provides valuable cost-effectiveness data comparing different professional groups which, along with the associated clinical trial, can be used as a basis for decisions relating to workforce and service organisation.

By moving skilled workers away from their existing jobs other consequences follow such as deskilling the existing workforce, the cost associated with any reduction in quality or outcomes of care, the cost of training new staff as a replacement and the impact of the loss of knowledge and clinical skill on a department. It would also be important to consider the consequences of reducing the number of doctors on patient care, future professional skills, postgraduate training and service. The unit cost of healthcare used in these calculations did accommodate the marginal and opportunity costs,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><offsets xml_i="32759" xml_f="32760" txt_i="21017" txt_f="21018">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32767" xml_f="33988" txt_i="21018" txt_f="22239"> but did not adequately investigate these forgone opportunities. A fourth consideration is that while the Doctor group are likely to be equivalent but possibly cheaper than the ESPs or ENPs the sensitivity analysis showed they were randomised to more of the relatively expensive lower-limb injuries. This has the potential to overestimate the doctor group's cost. The randomisation process was robust enough to eliminate the possibility of bias and this allocation is likely to be due to chance. A fifth consideration is that at the time this study was conducted it was not routine practice to issue sick notes/fit notes to patients attending the ED, and this applied to all professional groups (including doctors). The practice of issuing sick notes/fit notes to patients varies from hospital to hospital, and may be a factor in subsequent behaviour, but we believe that the type of healthcare practitioner a patient sees may be more influential, and are currently investigating this in further research. Finally, economic evaluation and cost-effectiveness data are useful for comparisons between different services, but there remains some doubt regarding how the information should be applied to inform decision making.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><offsets xml_i="34020" xml_f="34022" txt_i="22239" txt_f="22241">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34029" xml_f="34030" txt_i="22241" txt_f="22242">

If the information is used to provide healthcare from the perspective of the NHS, patient and society then ESPs and ENPs are likely to be equivalent in cost, or possibly more expensive. If the service is to be implemented in secondary care alone then the opposite applies. Third, if a view is taken at a national level, planning future service delivery and staffing to include educational costs, then all three groups become more or less equivalent in terms of both clinical quality and cost. At this point it is other factors such as workforce availability and sustainability, service provision and skill mix that become important. The UK College of Emergency Medicine recognises the need to utilise extensions in roles due to increasing patient demand, reducing hours of work for junior doctors and national throughput standards. The use of ENPs and ESPs in extended roles will therefore make a significant contribution to future minor injuries care.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28 R29 R30 R31 R32 R33"><offsets xml_i="37537" xml_f="37542" txt_i="25065" txt_f="25070">28â€“33</offsets></xref></p></sec><sec id="s10e"><title><offsets xml_i="37581" xml_f="37596" txt_i="25072" txt_f="25087">Future research</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37607" xml_f="38196" txt_i="25088" txt_f="25677">A further larger scale pragmatic trial of equivalence throughout the UK, with significantly longer follow-up periods and incorporating all the patients managed by the different healthcare professionals, would be valuable but highly challenging.
