the TOPICAL trial (in 2002), because at the time there were no other studies of first-line EGFR inhibitors in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were elderly or had poor performance status. These patients are often excluded from first-line chemotherapy trials.</p><p>Lung cancer is predominantly a disease of elderly people, and elderly patients with advanced NSCLC deemed unsuitable for chemotherapy with poor performance status (2 and 3) or several comorbidities, or both, remain a major challenge. Since TOPICAL, no phase 3 trials of first-line monotherapy for this group have been reported.</p><p><bold>Interpretation</bold></p><p>The findings of TOPICAL and other trials<xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5–8</sup></xref> show that erlotinib is an important treatment for patients with NSCLC in various clinical settings, including as maintenance after first-line chemotherapy, as second-line or third-line monotherapy in unselected patients with advanced NSCLC, and in chemotherapy-naive patients with activating <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations. However, unlike the TOPICAL patients, most of the patients in other studies had good performance status.</p><p>The clinical implications of the TOPICAL trial are that patients who are deemed unsuitable for chemotherapy could be given erlotinib. Those who have <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation-positive tumours could receive continuous erlotinib; whereas those who have wild-type tumours should discontinue erlotinib after about 28 days if they do not develop a rash because of the possibility of decreased survival.</p></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
