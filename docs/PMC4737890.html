Patients aged 18 years or older with one primary localised cutaneous melanoma greater than 2 mm in Breslow thickness arising on the trunk or limbs (but not including the soles of feet or palms of hands) were eligible for the study. Before randomisation, the primary melanoma was excised in an initial surgery with either a 1 mm (proposed pathway) or 1 cm (alternative pathway) margin of excision. A diagnosis of melanoma with a Breslow thickness greater than 2 mm was confirmed histopathologically by histopathologists in participating centres. Two histopathologists from the trial management group did a histopathological review of the primary melanoma in all cases.

Elective lymph node dissection and sentinel node biopsy were not part of routine practice at the time the trial was undertaken and adjuvant chemotherapy was not allowed in the trial protocol. After treatment, patients were followed up for local and distant relapse and death every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for up to 5 years, and annually thereafter. Assessment of disease at the point of relapse was by standard clinical practice within participating centres at that time. Data from trial case report forms (when available) were used to identify cause of death. To maximise the amount of survival data obtained, we also traced UK patients (n=790) for their vital status and in January, 2012, we requested the death certificates of patients known to have died to identify the cause of death as stated on the certificate. Death certificates were not obtained for non-UK patients (n=110). Death was classed as melanoma-specific if the cause of death was reported as melanoma on the clinical trial case-report form for death, or if any evidence was present of distant metastatic melanoma at the time of death (as reported in patient files or on death certificates).

For melanoma-specific survival, patients who died of non-melanoma causes were censored at the time of death and patients who died from an unknown cause were censored on the day before their date of death. Both UK and non-UK patients who were not known to have died were censored at the date of their last visit.
