Pharmacotherapy is the main treatment currently offered, but this has only limited effectiveness. A recent Cochrane review has reported that adding psycho-social interventions that train people to recognise and manage the early warning signs of their relapses is effective in increasing time to recurrence, improving social functioning and in reducing hospitalisations. However, the review also highlights the difficulties in offering these interventions within standard mental health services due to the need for highly trained therapists and extensive input of time. There is a need to explore the potential for developing Early Warning Sign (EWS) interventions in ways that will enhance dissemination.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5768" xml_f="5786" txt_i="855" txt_f="873">Methods and design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5797" xml_f="6745" txt_i="874" txt_f="1822">This article describes a cluster-randomised trial to assess the feasibility of training care coordinators (CCs) in community mental health teams (CMHTs) to offer Enhanced Relapse Prevention (ERP) to people with Bipolar Disorder.

The review highlights the need for further research to explore cost-effective ways in which these interventions can be offered within the NHS.

A CMHT is a multidisciplinary team of health professionals (community mental health nurses, occupational therapists, psychiatric social workers, clinical psychologists and psychiatrists) working out of a team base in the geographical locality the CMHT serves. The CMHT sees service users at the base, other clinic bases or in the home of the service user. All service users with serious mental illness whose needs require more than the support of one professional group would be looked after by a CMHT with one of the health professionals in the team acting as a CC taking the lead role for coordinating the care of the patient but not delivering all aspects of the patient's care [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="12680" xml_f="12682" txt_i="7151" txt_f="7153">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12689" xml_f="13430" txt_i="7153" txt_f="7894">]. All service users in the CMHT will have as a minimum a CC and a psychiatrist but there may also be other members of the CMHT or other health or social service professionals who would provide specific services to the service user with BD. Hence, this study focuses on issues related to the clinical effectiveness of relapse prevention in a real world setting that uses existing CCs and is able to examine the impact and the barriers that arise in this situation. We are aiming to address the important issue of transferring evidence-based interventions from psychological research settings into NHS practice. Interventions that have been shown to be clinically efficacious under ideal conditions may not be effective in clinical practice [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="13462" xml_f="13464" txt_i="7894" txt_f="7896">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13471" xml_f="13741" txt_i="7896" txt_f="8166">].

Once trained, these teams would be unable to offer treatment as usual. Thus in order to assess the effectiveness of the intervention, a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) is needed in which the CMHT is the unit of randomisation. Effectiveness can be assessed at two levels; firstly, the effectiveness of the training on the ability of the CCs to carry out the key elements of the ERP interventions; secondly the effectiveness of the CC delivered ERP intervention on reducing relapse rates in people with Bipolar Disorder.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14529" xml_f="16167" txt_i="8903" txt_f="10541">A large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of the ERP intervention is required. However, this is likely to be a very expensive study due to the costs of training staff and the recruitment, assessment and retention of large numbers of staff, service users and relatives. Therefore it is important that the study is theoretically well designed, methodologically feasible, adequately powered to identify any impact the intervention has on outcome, and well executed. To enable this to happen, essential information is required that will be obtained from this study. This includes: an understanding of what current TAU is for people with Bipolar Disorder who are offered a service by CMHTs; acceptability of the ERP intervention, training and supervision packages; effectiveness of training and supervision on Care Coordinator competency and confidence to offer ERP; recruitment and retention rates for CMHTs, individual Care Coordinators, service users with BD and relatives; acceptability, validity and reliability of assessment measures including those modified for the study; identification of major barriers to carrying out the project within the NHS; an estimate of the effect size of the intervention; an estimate of the design effect of clustering. Detailed evaluation of process variables will allow the mechanism of action to be understood so that important inferences can be drawn in terms of the wider implementation of the intervention.

This intervention is highly consistent with the psychosocial components of treatment recommended by the recent NICE Clinical Guidelines for Bipolar Disorder [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="38755" xml_f="38756" txt_i="28555" txt_f="28556">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38763" xml_f="38765" txt_i="28556" txt_f="28558">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38772" xml_f="39612" txt_i="28559" txt_f="29399">We have designed the feasibility study to provide as much detailed and accurate information as possible. The inclusion criteria for staff and for service users are as wide as possible to increase generalisability. The manual and all training materials are designed to a high standard and quality for wider dissemination. Detailed feedback is sought on the training and supervision. The service user assessments include well standardised, valid and reliable measures of the key outcome variables, along with extensive qualitative interviews to explore the experiences of participants in depth. The research team meet on a regular basis to discuss and log barriers faced in conducting the research and ideas for how these could be avoided/overcome in future work.

Firstly, this study is designed to assess the impact of clustering at the level of CMHT and to account for this in the statistical analysis of outcome. However, in reality the study has 2 levels of clustering: the CMHT and the Care Coordinator. Each Care Coordinator is asked to offer the ERP intervention to a minimum of 3 service users. It could be argued that data from service users who receive the intervention from the same Care Coordinator is likely to be correlated more highly than that from different Care Coordinators within the same team. However, due to the fact that the number of people within each cluster at the CC level would be likely to be very small i.e. 3, and the total sample would be insufficient to explore multiple level clustering, this will not be accounted for in the analysis.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40532" xml_f="41513" txt_i="30307" txt_f="31288">Secondly, we have argued that a cluster design is required because ERP is essentially a team approach. Service users may need to be able to contact the CMHT at very short notice in response to increased recognition of important changes in their early signs of relapse. An effective and reliable response from the team is essential. For this reason, whichever CMHT staff member is currently on duty should be able to work with the ERP plan. In reality, we have recruited teams with a minimum of 4 CCs consenting to take part. This is for purely pragmatic reasons. In setting up the study, services felt unable to commit the time and resources for all staff to attend. Although the documentation regarding early signs monitoring and action plans is available in the service users notes, future work needs to address the best ways to disseminate information within and between mental health teams. It is possible that this limitation will reduce the effectiveness of the intervention.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41520" xml_f="41941" txt_i="31289" txt_f="31710">Thirdly, due to the time constraints on the study, we are unable to recruit all service users prior to randomisation at each NHS Trust site. CCs make referrals throughout the study and generally offer ERP sequentially to one person at a time. Teams in TAU also make referrals throughout as more people who are eligible are identified. We are assessing and will report on whether or not this has led to a recruitment bias.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41948" xml_f="42358" txt_i="31711" txt_f="32121">Fourthly, we are not able to assess fidelity to the intervention for all service users. The trial therapist makes a rating of adherence to the manual for the service users who are offered the intervention during the period of supervision. However, after completing the first intervention, CCs are offering ERP to service users outside of supervision. There is no assessment of fidelity for these interventions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42365" xml_f="43019" txt_i="32122" txt_f="32776">These limitations are clearly important and need to be addressed in future work. However, despite these, the results from this study are essential in progressing research and clinical innovation in this area. If we are able to show that it is feasible to train CCs in the NHS to offer ERP for people with Bipolar Disorder, it will be possible to design a large scale definitive trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on relapse rates. Such an intervention has the potential to offer service users a way of increasing control over their mood disorder and ultimately improving their quality of life and that of their relatives and friends.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="43041" xml_f="43060" txt_i="32778" txt_f="32797">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="43071" xml_f="43126" txt_i="32798" txt_f="32853">The author(s) declare they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="43148" xml_f="43170" txt_i="32855" txt_f="32877">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="43181" xml_f="44115" txt_i="32878" txt_f="33812">FL was involved in the design, oversaw the implementation, produced initial draft of manual, and drafted the manuscript.
