Currently, the intervention program for this group of patients in the Netherlands aims at increasing disease-specific education and encouraging compliance with prescribed exercises and a pain contingent regime of relative (bed) rest and avoiding and limiting several day-to-day activities such as using the stairs, bending, twisting, lifting and cycling. Therapists rely heavily on reported pain duration and intensity during goal setting for intervention.

Midwives and gynecologists recruited the women during early pregnancy (10â14 weeks). Women were included in the cohort if they were at least 18 years old, pregnant and well versed in the Dutch language (n = 7526). Women were given written information explaining the aims and contents of the cohort and intervention studies before they decided to participate. Concerning the intervention study they were told that according to current knowledge, the two investigated treatment options are considered to be equally effective. The moment of inclusion for the intervention study was about three weeks after delivery. An individual woman entered the intervention study after signing informed consent for both the cohort and the intervention studies during early pregnancy and meeting the in-and exclusion criteria of the intervention study shortly after delivery. A basic principle was that inclusion criteria must have a meaningful influence in goal setting for treatment. Women were included when having pain in the pelvic girdle (including the lower back) with an onset during pregnancy or within two weeks after delivery (cohort data), were restricted in their normal daily activities because of pelvic girdle and/or low back pain and if there was a delay in recuperation (unable to participate satisfactorily in housekeeping and care of children because of the complaints under investigation). The severity of symptoms should vary with physical activities and time during the day. In the absence of a clear definition and reference standard to diagnose pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain, the outcomes of a number of currently used diagnostic classification strategies not only led to different selections of women having complaints, the prognostic importance of these subgroups remained also unclear. Therefore we used an extensive description of pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain. Women diagnosed with relevant specific pathology (such as nerve root pathology, rheumatoid disorders, carcinoma, obstetric complications) that affects pain and activities of daily life were excluded. Exclusion also occurred in case of severe family-related or psychosocial problems or when a disablement procedure was not yet finished. Final aspects for in-/exclusion were the willingness of a woman to participate in the study or having a clear treatment preference. We only included women who did not indicate such a preference [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"><offsets xml_i="15127" xml_f="15129" txt_i="9613" txt_f="9615">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15136" xml_f="15138" txt_i="9615" txt_f="9617">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15145" xml_f="16727" txt_i="9618" txt_f="11200">An experienced research-physiotherapist visited the women at home, about three weeks after delivery.

A positive answer from a participating woman from the cohort or her midwife: "Is an intervention by a physiotherapist necessary?" took a central position in these questionnaires. Preceding a possible home visit, a short history taking by telephone took place about two weeks after delivery. The telephone interview focused on exclusion criteria such as willingness to participate, specific pathology and inclusion criteria such as limitations in daily life caused by pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain and a delay in recuperation. During the home visit, a standardized history was taken and physical examination to exclude specific pathology was performed. Self-administered questionnaires were used to asses pain, limitations in activities, restrictions in participation, pain-related fear, pain catastrophizing, positive and negative affectivity, depression, expectancy of treatment result and quality of life. The questionnaires contained clear instructions to complete them with no help or support from others. If a woman met the selection criteria, she was informed about the aim and method of the intervention study and if she was willing to participate, the informed consent procedure was completed.

Information about two opposing behavioral responses of pain-related fear (avoidance and confrontation) was given and a hierarchy of individual fear-eliciting movements and activities was made.

For that reason the recruitment of women with persistent complaints and limitations in activities after delivery was lower than expected. We used the maximum of participants out of the cohort (n = 7526) and still included only 126 women. Nevertheless, we reached sufficient statistical power for the primary outcome, limitations in activities.

The recovery rates of both study groups were still relatively high, 12 weeks after delivery. The reasons why a relatively large number of women in the control group abandoned the current treatment option on second thought, leads to the suspect that the favorable prognosis and distraction of the mind by environmental factors (the new born baby and the change in family life) influenced the ask for help by a physiotherapist.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38619" xml_f="39791" txt_i="30304" txt_f="31476">Longitudinal data of our cohort study (n = 7526) two weeks after delivery showed also a considerable drop in the number of women that reported pain in the lumbo-pelvic region. In literature there is some consensus about a good prognosis after delivery but not in the same extending as in our cohort. However, we could investigate the course of pregnancy-related pelvic girdle and/or low back pain more in detail and could combine it with the ask for help (physiotherapist) during pregnancy and after delivery in a very large group of women (n = 7526). Focusing only on pain did not answer our question if an intervention by a physiotherapist is advisable for whom and when, satisfactory. A reasonable number of women reported still some pain after delivery but they did not want to be referred to a physiotherapist anymore. Still having some pain was obviously not a deciding factor for many women to search for help. Other factors interfered such as a delay in becoming active again after delivery. Details about the enrollment out of the cohort into the trial showed that the start of the experimental intervention (three weeks after delivery) was reasonably well timed.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39798" xml_f="40372" txt_i="31477" txt_f="32048">Subgroup analysis showed that women with moderate limitations in activities (score RDQ at baseline &lt;13 points) improved quite well and nearly in the same extent in both study groups. However, in the subgroups with severe limitations in activities (score RDQ at baseline â¥ 13 points) the improvement favored the experimental intervention group compared to women in the usual care group.

The outcomes of those interviews were compared with literature findings and the outcomes of the group discussions. The answers of women about their perception of the contents of the current treatment approach and the patient-therapist relationship formed a sharp contrast with the view of the therapists about those topics. It made clear that worries about their condition in this population of women are not minor concerns. The worries referred to an unremitting source of anxiety about the etiology and prognosis. The degree of distress may contribute to avoidance of picking up the full range of activities again after delivery and the feeling that a wrong movement could lead to a serious problem, making individual concerns and worries an important target of care. These aspects and the contrast in perception between therapist and patient were important reasons to introduce, within the scope of a biopsychosocial approach, the theoretical concepts of self-management and fear-avoidance. The developed standardized patient information focused therefore on positive attitudes, an active response to the complaints and a physiological rationale about pain. It did not include information about a possible vulnerability of the spine or pelvis to damage and a relation with pain.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42702" xml_f="43559" txt_i="34315" txt_f="35172">In general, women were willing to accept the responsibility to manage their own condition and solve their problems with guidance from the physiotherapists. They picked up the time contingent approach quickly. Nevertheless, there was some hesitation of a number of participating physiotherapists about their role in the intervention protocol during the educational training prior to the trial. Once they were be engaged with patients, they liked their supporting role of the women to create plans that will help her to achieve their goals. The shift from a pain contingent approach to a time contingent approach and the radical change in the character of the patient-therapist relationship seemed to be easier for the women than for the physiotherapists. Finally, both the women and the physiotherapists found the intervention protocol attractive and useful.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="43581" xml_f="43591" txt_i="35174" txt_f="35184">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="43602" xml_f="44550" txt_i="35185" txt_f="36133">The results of the trial supported the hypothesis. Although the biopsychosocial approach as a basis for intervention already is largely investigated in several musculoskeletal disorders and generated significant results, in the field of pregnancy-related pelvic girdle and/or low back pain it is a new approach. Women's individual worries and concerns about their condition were major targets in the experimental intervention. By adopting action plans as the most important act for goal setting, women's own values and the role of the therapist were included in the approach. The considerable drop of pain shortly after delivery influenced clearly the number of women that want to be referred to a physiotherapist. Because of the high level of improvement in both groups (even without treatment), it seems likely that the large improvement in the first weeks after delivery continued for a substantial deal in the first three months after delivery.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44572" xml_f="44591" txt_i="36135" txt_f="36154">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44602" xml_f="44662" txt_i="36155" txt_f="36215">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44684" xml_f="44706" txt_i="36217" txt_f="36239">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44717" xml_f="44924" txt_i="36240" txt_f="36447">CHGB: first author is involved in the design, data collection, statistical analysis, development of the experimental intervention, training the participating physiotherapist and the performance of the trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44931" xml_f="45243" txt_i="36448" txt_f="36760">RAdeB: has made substantial contributions to conception of the study, obtained grants, participated in the design, coordination, statistical analyses, has made substantial contribution to the development of the experimental intervention and is involved in revising the article for important intellectual content.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45250" xml_f="45446" txt_i="36761" txt_f="36957">PMJCW: participated in the design, has made substantial contribution to the development of the experimental intervention and is involved in revising the article for important intellectual content.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45453" xml_f="45573" txt_i="36958" txt_f="37078">PL: participated in the statistical analyses and is involved in revising the article for important intellectual content.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45580" xml_f="45776" txt_i="37079" txt_f="37275">JWSV: has made substantial contributions the development of the experimental intervention and choose of the measurements and is involved in revising the article for important intellectual content.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45783" xml_f="45911" txt_i="37276" txt_f="37404">FS: participated as research-physician in this study and is involved in revising the article for important intellectual content.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45918" xml_f="46050" txt_i="37405" txt_f="37537">JMB: participated in the design and statistical analyses and is involved in revising the article for important intellectual content.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46057" xml_f="46231" txt_i="37538" txt_f="37712">GGME and PvdB: have made substantial contributions to conception, design and experimental intervention and revising the article critically for important intellectual content.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="46253" xml_f="46276" txt_i="37714" txt_f="37737">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="46287" xml_f="46351" txt_i="37738" txt_f="37802">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/7/19/prepub"></ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The funding for this study was provided by the Health Care Insurance Board (College voor zorgverzekeringen CVZ) in the Netherlands as a part of a research project titled " Peripartum pelvic pain during pregnancy and after delivery".
