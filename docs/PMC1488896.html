This model uses a client-centred approach in which the occupational therapist clearly involves the client in the decision-making process. This approach was chosen since in this study participants did not consult the occupational therapist for an existing problem, but instead the elderly people were approached by the occupational therapist.

When indicated, participants received recommendations and information about procedures, possibilities, and costs of assistive devices and community-based services that might be beneficial for them. In cases in which participants decided to apply for the device or service, the occupational therapist provided assistance in filling out application forms or helped with purchasing.

Because we analysed our results on an intention-to-treat basis, these 55 participants might actually have diluted a possible beneficial treatment effect. However, excluding them from the analysis would have introduced bias because it is unlikely that the group of participants who declined the intervention is a random sample of the total group. Second, of the 147 participants who were visited by an occupational therapist, less than half actually had an indication for an intervention. This means that this group of 85-y-olds can be considered well equipped, although there is room for further improvement. Third, not all participants for whom an intervention was indicated complied with the proposed intervention. In most cases, those who did not comply either felt they were confronted with a problem for which they did not experience having a problem or felt it was not necessary to solve the problem. In either of these cases, no action was taken by the participants.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25575" xml_f="25750" txt_i="17739" txt_f="17914">We have previously reported the results of an unsolicited auditory rehabilitation programme for 85-y-old community-dwelling elderly people with untreated severe hearing loss [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010002-b014" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="25796" xml_f="25798" txt_i="17914" txt_f="17916">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25805" xml_f="26577" txt_i="17916" txt_f="18688">]. In that study, the majority of participants declined auditory rehabilitation because they did not perceive the use of a hearing aid as necessary in order to function on a daily basis. Those who expected benefits from a hearing aid had already obtained one. A similar reasoning probably holds for the present study, in which occupational therapy was offered to the same age group. Those elderly people who expected to benefit from a certain assistive device or community-based services probably had already obtained them. This became apparent in the distribution of assistive device and community-based services that were already present (591 and 125, respectively) versus the assistive device and community-based services that were obtained (44 and five, respectively).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26584" xml_f="26703" txt_i="18689" txt_f="18808">During the study, 52 participants died.

However, conditional on a well-organised healthcare system, very elderly people apparently do not solely depend on active case-finding and close surveillance. Instead, they seem to carefully plan the timing of their adaptations to maintain their functional abilities. We think that future elderly people will probably exhibit more of the phenomenon of making independent decisions on the use of assistive devices and community-based services. Therefore, we conclude that unsolicited offering of assistive devices and community-based services to high-risk 85-y-old participants does not decelerate the increase in disability over time.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title><offsets xml_i="29545" xml_f="29567" txt_i="21272" txt_f="21294">SUPPORTING INFORMATION</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010002-sd001"><label><offsets xml_i="29656" xml_f="29673" txt_i="21295" txt_f="21312">CONSORT Checklist</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="29693" xml_f="29704" txt_i="21312" txt_f="21323">(40 KB DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0010002.sd001.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="29773" xml_f="29809" txt_i="21324" txt_f="21360">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010002-sd002"><label><offsets xml_i="29937" xml_f="29951" txt_i="21361" txt_f="21375">Trial Protocol</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="29971" xml_f="29982" txt_i="21375" txt_f="21386">(66 KB DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0010002.sd002.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="30051" xml_f="30087" txt_i="21387" txt_f="21423">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010002-sd003"><label><offsets xml_i="30215" xml_f="30239" txt_i="21424" txt_f="21448">Trial Protocol Amendment</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="30259" xml_f="30270" txt_i="21448" txt_f="21459">(20 KB DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0010002.sd003.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="30339" xml_f="30375" txt_i="21460" txt_f="21496">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010002-sd004"><label><offsets xml_i="30503" xml_f="30510" txt_i="21497" txt_f="21504">Text S1</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="30534" xml_f="30580" txt_i="21504" txt_f="21550">Assistive Devices and Community-Based Services</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="30591" xml_f="30602" txt_i="21551" txt_f="21562">(20 KB DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0010002.sd004.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="30671" xml_f="30707" txt_i="21563" txt_f="21599">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="ack1"><title></title><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p>
