Households within the selected catchment areas, randomly sampled from detailed maps of city blocks, were visited by project field staff, and all potentially eligible older people within selected households were identified.

Of these, 351 individuals stated that they were willing to attend a further appointment, the majority of the remainder stated that they had no time (65%) or no interest (35%). Of the 351 individuals expressing an interest, 242 were recruited to the study. The concomitant availability of 2002 census data made it clear that adults aged 65–67.9 were spread thinly and were also unevenly geographically distributed in the selected clusters. It was therefore decided that a new sampling strategy within clusters was required. The revised recruitment strategy was based on the gathered evidence which indicated that 95% of those who had been identified as potentially eligible via the random sampling procedure, were also on health centre registries. It was therefore agreed that the names of older people on registries held in health centres would be used as the basis for recruitment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19939" xml_f="20397" txt_i="13757" txt_f="14215">Potential participants identified by either of these strategies received, on contact, an information sheet outlining the nature and importance of the study, and were asked for contact details.

It was therefore agreed that rather than making the nutritional supplement available to all eligible individuals in the selected clusters, a sample would be defined that would enable the detection of the proposed primary outcome regarding pneumonia incidence, (a reduction of 33% in the incidence of pneumonia in the PACAM intervention group relative to the control).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38107" xml_f="38605" txt_i="27746" txt_f="28244">Furthermore, during the initial months of the project the MOH implemented a new model of health insurance, called AUGE, which provides guaranteed timely access to health services for specific diseases.
