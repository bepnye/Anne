Mainly qualitative data were gathered including observation of all (virtual and face-to-face) commissioning meetings; semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of participants (n = 32/66); structured questionnaires and interviews with lead researchers of early commissioned projects.

Despite the potential for greater access using a virtual approach, few differences were found in practice. Key advantages included physical access, a more flexible and extended time period for discussion, reflection and information gathering and a more transparent decision-making process. Key challenges were the reduction of social cues available in a computer-mediated medium that require novel ways of ensuring appropriate dialogue, feedback and interaction. However, in both modes, the process was influenced by a range of factors and was not technology driven.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4944" xml_f="4954" txt_i="1902" txt_f="1912">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4965" xml_f="5280" txt_i="1913" txt_f="2228">There is potential for using computer-mediated communication within the research commissioning process.

A website was designed and piloted to enable committees to meet 'virtually' to agree priorities and commission projects. An open recruitment process was also used, including adverts for membership in the popular press. This 'naturalistic experiment' was conceived by the Department of Health with the aims of including a wider constituency in the research process, and so sits within recent policy and practice emphasis within the health service of increasing inclusion in policy, research and practice. It was also intended to enhance the effectiveness and transparency of the process, to contribute to the quality of health research. The authors were commissioned by the UK Department of Health to evaluate the effects of this experiment. The aims agreed for the study were to assess the practical workings of this new approach, its feasibility and whether it may have the intended benefits of enhancing the accessibility, transparency or quality of the research commissioning process. Taking into account the nature of the programme, and the early stage of experimentation with this approach to research commissioning, we opted to use an action research approach, to ensure learning and feedback within the process. The random allocation of different groups to the novel virtual approach or the traditional face-to-face approach enabled us to combine this with a naturalistic-experimental approach using comparison of the process and experiences of the different commissioning groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6996" xml_f="7138" txt_i="3875" txt_f="4017">This paper reports on our overall evaluation and a following paper will discuss the conceptual issues raised relating to CMC in greater depth.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7145" xml_f="8218" txt_i="4018" txt_f="5091">The UK Department of Health in the 1990s commissioned research on a range of health related topics centrally, in particular priority areas and through its regional offices. During the decade there were shifts towards a more strategic approach – designed to meet specific health objectives – and a more inclusive approach, intended to involve practitioners and users of health services more fully in the research process. Greater attention was also focused on the effectiveness of health research and how far it was meeting the needs of the service and of the nation's health. The project studied here sits within that context of development. Traditionally, health research at central and regional level has been planned and commissioned by formal committees, meeting face to face and involving mainly health policy and research experts, supported by anonymous expert peer review of proposals. The 'virtual commissioning' project we studied represented an attempt to move the traditional process towards one that would be more transparent, more effective and more inclusive.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8225" xml_f="9117" txt_i="5092" txt_f="5984">Given the early stage of the work, we focus on the process, as observed and as perceived by the participants, in particular the nature of online, asynchronous communication within relatively formal, task-focused groups, and examine some early indicators of outcomes. Key themes emerging included access to participation, interactivity within formal groups (both virtual and face-to-face) the role of language in this, and the uses of time. We also examine indicators of the quality of commissioning resulting from this approach. The issues arising in this study may provide reflection on interaction within formal groups in a range of settings and support the argument that the impact of different media are socially situated, not technically dependent. Nonetheless, the evaluation highlights issues that need to be considered in designing an environment and process for 'virtual' committees.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9133" xml_f="9152" txt_i="5985" txt_f="6004">Relevant literature</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9163" xml_f="9801" txt_i="6005" txt_f="6643">A comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken using CINAHL, Medline and Sociological Abstracts as well as a number of education and management databases.

The remainder were conducted at a venue chosen by the member and were normally tape recorded, with permission. Informal interviews with the three Regional R&amp;D Officers who were most closely involved with the Programme were used to explore intentions and perceptions of the virtual commissioning process.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30221" xml_f="30515" txt_i="22909" txt_f="23203">Collaborative enquiry (CE) groups were planned to include committee members, chairpersons and Programme managers.

This suggests that neither the open advertising for membership, nor the use of a virtual approach directly increased the number of non-research professional participants. Lack of records meant that we were unable to determine whether few had shown any interest in the adverts for members, or whether interested non-researchers were deterred by the tone and presentation of documents sent out to enquirers – which were thought by members to be rather technical rather than 'user-friendly' packages.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39957" xml_f="40404" txt_i="31184" txt_f="31631">Of the virtual groups, one had no primarily 'consumer' members and the other had two, one of whom made only one contribution – to suggest a topic at the beginning of Phase One – while the other had the highest level of contributions in the group, despite being the only member without a computer, relying on public library access.

This is reflected in the literature and the aims of the Programme studied here. However, the picture in practice was more complex. For example, one member with academic expertise in the theme area of his Group who was also experiencing physical disability was quite clear that being able to participate from his own computer was an advantage of the approach, yet he still did not experience the process as accessible and his participation decreased throughout so that he did not participate at all in Phase Two. This was related in part to a feeling of lack of interactivity and response, discussed below, which discouraged participation at a time when, in his view, he needed positive reinforcement to continue. In contrast, a practitioner member noted that without the virtual approach he simply would not have been able to participate, due to the inflexible nature of his clinic duties. In such cases access was about relationships between time and physical place</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42165" xml_f="43402" txt_i="33368" txt_f="34605">Access to the technology in itself did not prove to be a major barrier, since all but one member had computer and internet access, and this person used public facilities very effectively. However established patterns of using computers and online communication were important, since some had incorporated this more into their work pattern or lifestyle than others, and some members were not sufficiently 'at ease' with this mode to take advantage of its flexibility. This was more than a technical – competence and confidence – matter, since highly active members tended to be those who had incorporated computer and internet use into their everyday and working lives in such a way that regular participation, with frequent, often short log-ins, seemed relatively easy and straightforward. In contrast, some members used to a highly structured diary-approach to work participated little in practice, despite their best intentions. These tended to be members in management and policy type roles who did not lack other forms of experience or confidence to participate. This does provide a warning, however, that changes in medium or technology may, if not prepared for appropriately, substitute new for older forms of inequality of access.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43409" xml_f="43864" txt_i="34606" txt_f="35061">The greater time that the literature suggests is needed for CMC was built effectively into the process studied here – with a total of nineteen days, structured into phases, versus two, three hour face-to-face meetings.

Levels of participation at this stage varied more between the groups within each mode than across them suggesting that the medium of communication was less important than other features such as the topic and the membership mix of each group and the facilitative role of the chairperson. In the Health and Regeneration group, for example, Phase One discussion was seen as 'lively' and even 'heated' in some topic areas and generated a 7,000 word transcript overall (transcripts of the discussion could be copied from the commissioning group website). Phase Two – considering research proposals – was seen as losing momentum, with more limited discussion and dialogue. Even among those who participated, some were more active than others, offering contributions and responses to others, while others simply gave their view in the manner of a statement, without any dialogue.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45793" xml_f="46148" txt_i="36909" txt_f="37264">This suggests that the issues of 'groupness' and 'trust' raised in the literature are not particular to CMC and present a general challenge for formal decision-making groups with a limited history.

In one case, a face-to-face meeting was organised in the time gaps between Phases One and Two due to concerns within the group about momentum and interactivity of the virtual process. This suggests that participants may perceive a need to meet face-to-face, even where CMC has been established, but also that a very extended time period, for a task-focused group, may add to feelings of lack of interactivity and a loss of momentum.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47012" xml_f="47716" txt_i="38110" txt_f="38814">In the face-to-face mode the primary problem was, nonetheless, lack of time to conduct very detailed business in a three-hour meeting. The level of formality and structure observed within the meetings was seen by members as important to achieving this and they regarded the process as effective within these limits. In contrast, in the virtual mode, which is characterised by asynchronous communication, time lags and gaps in response led to feelings of lack of dialogue which some members described as 'lonely' or even 'threatening' in the absence of cues to help explain the lack of response.

Techniques that can be used to enhance a sense of interaction were not well developed in the site and the training provided for virtual group members focused on technical aspects of using the meeting website rather than on how to approach dialogue and decision-making within a virtual medium. Some members attempted a conversational style, and responded to others' contributions directly using first names and examples from personal experience to illustrate their points.

It also tended to shift during the meetings toward dominance of technical research questions and so was increasingly led by academics. Use of language was polite, reasonable, measured and members were generally supportive of each other's contributions, including non-verbal gestures such as nods of agreement. Nonetheless, members tended to follow certain themes and not to radically change views in response to others' comments. One group, with a higher proportion of consumer and voluntary sector members raised more questions about ethics, scope, perspective of proposals, as well as procedural issues and inclusiveness of the bids. The challenge for the chairperson, in either mode, was equally in drawing a rather disparate group of 'strangers' together in a very limited time span to produce clear results.

It is clear from this study and from the existing literature, that the use of technology – such as the bespoke website used here – does not determine processes or outcomes.

The capacity to seek further information was highlighted as particularly important to ensure the decision makers were well informed and that work done does not duplicate that done elsewhere. It is very difficult for even the most knowledgeable membership to have all relevant information to hand in a live, time limited meeting. Set against these were the longer time needed for CMC, the lack of familiarity with working and communicating in virtual groups and the perception of finality, formality and inflexibility of textual messages.

There is little evidence to support the effectiveness of the 'traditional' modes of decision-making against which novel approaches must inevitably be compared. Our study tentatively suggests that the outputs of the research commissioned early in this Programme indicate that the novel approach is feasible and may bring additional benefits if managed appropriately.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="67517" xml_f="67536" txt_i="56455" txt_f="56474">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="67547" xml_f="67607" txt_i="56475" txt_f="56535">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="67629" xml_f="67651" txt_i="56537" txt_f="56559">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="67662" xml_f="67815" txt_i="56560" txt_f="56713">All authors participated in the design, conduct and analysis of the study and the writing of this paper.
