Beta-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7), a peptide uniquely derived from the A1 type of β-casein, was previously reported to downregulate glutathione expression in human gut epithelial and neuronal cell lines by limiting cysteine uptake. The current human study demonstrates that consumption of milk containing only A2 β-casein was associated with a greater increase in plasma glutathione concentrations compared with the consumption of milk containing both β-casein types, and did not increase plasma BCM-7 concentrations compared with the washout diet in the study participants. Thus, milk containing only A2 β-casein and not A1 β-casein has the potential to promote the production of the antioxidant glutathione in humans.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4875" xml_f="4902" txt_i="1022" txt_f="1049">Clinical Trial Registration</offsets></title><p id="Par2"><offsets xml_i="4923" xml_f="4955" txt_i="1050" txt_f="1082">ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier: </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02406469"><offsets xml_i="5046" xml_f="5057" txt_i="1082" txt_f="1093">NCT02406469</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="5068" xml_f="5069" txt_i="1093" txt_f="1094">

Either or both of these β-casein types may be expressed in milk, depending on the cow’s genetic makeup.

Although it was not possible to examine the direct impact of complete elimination of dietary BCM-7 on circulating GSH concentrations, the diet-dependent changes observed in the present study indicate that the residual BCM-7 concentrations detected in the A2 β-casein phase participants were comparable to the washout period without supplementary A1 β-casein consumption and did not adversely affect GSH uptake.</offsets></p><p id="Par28"><offsets xml_i="25631" xml_f="26435" txt_i="18503" txt_f="19307">In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that daily consumption of commercially available conventional milk is associated with an increase in GSH concentrations, possibly as a consequence of increased supply of cysteine in whey protein. However, the magnitude of this increase in GSH concentrations was greater when the participants consumed milk containing the A2 type of β-casein as compared with milk containing both A1 and A2 β-casein. This elevation might be attenuated by the presence of the A1 type of β-casein relative to milk containing only the A2 type of β-casein. These results suggest that eliminating the A1 type of β-casein from milk may allow for a greater increase in GSH concentrations or maximize the potential for GSH production, and hence confer greater antioxidant capacity.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec9"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par35">
