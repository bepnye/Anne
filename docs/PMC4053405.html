A prospective randomised controlled trial of the H&amp;N Cancer Survivor Self-management Care Plan (HNCP) involving pre- and post-intervention assessments will be used. Consecutive patients who have completed a defined treatment protocol for H&amp;N cancer will be recruited from two large cancer services and randomly allocated to one of three study arms: (1) usual care, (2) information in the form of a written resource or (3) the HNCP delivered by an oncology nurse who has participated in manual-based training and skill development in patient self-management support. The trained nurses will meet patients in a face-to-face interview lasting up to 60 minutes to develop an individualised HNCP, based on principles of chronic disease self-management. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measure is quality of life. The secondary outcome measures include mood, self-efficacy and health-care utilisation. The feasibility of implementing this intervention in routine clinical care will be assessed through semistructured interviews with participating nurses, managers and administrators. Interviews with patients who received the HNCP will explore their perceptions of the HNCP, including factors that assisted them in achieving behavioural change.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8403" xml_f="8413" txt_i="1937" txt_f="1947">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8424" xml_f="8803" txt_i="1948" txt_f="2327">In this study, we aim to improve the quality of life of a patient population with unique needs by means of a tailored self-management care plan developed upon completion of treatment.

Treatments can involve extensive surgery, which may result in marked disfigurement, especially if treatments include extensive neck dissection or removal of part of the maxilla or mandible.
