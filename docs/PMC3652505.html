The Asian Disease Problem is a classic example: Imagine that the United States is preparing for an outbreak of an unusual Asian disease that is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs have been proposed to combat the disease. Scientific estimates of the consequences of the programs are figured out. Positive frame: If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved; If Program B is adopted, there is 1/3 probability that all 600 people will be saved and 2/3 probability that no one will be saved. Negative frame: If Program C is adopted, 400 people will die; If Program D is adopted, there is 1/3 probability that all none will die, and 2/3 probability that all people will die. Since A &amp; C and B &amp; D were logically equivalent, there should be no difference in preference for people. Also, there should be no shift of preferences from risk seeking to risk avoiding simply because of how the problem is described. However, Tversky and Kahneman reported in their study that 71% of the participants would choose A rather than B in a positive frame, while 72 % of the participants would choose D rather than C in a negative frame (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R1"><offsets xml_i="7515" xml_f="7516" txt_i="3289" txt_f="3290">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7523" xml_f="7525" txt_i="3290" txt_f="3292">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7532" xml_f="7763" txt_i="3293" txt_f="3524">Considerable studies followed suggested that framing effect was a wide spread and robust phenomenon, and steadily existed in various fields of decision making problems, like economy, lifesaving, resource allocation and management (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R2"><offsets xml_i="7799" xml_f="7802" txt_i="3524" txt_f="3527">2-8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7809" xml_f="8336" txt_i="3527" txt_f="4054">). While some studies also found that there were certain situations particularities in different frames. Levin, Schneider and Gaeth identified three types of framing tasks as: risky-choice framing, for example, Asia Disease Problem; attribute framing, like a pound of beef can be described as “80 lean” or “20% fat”, may significantly influence people’s evaluation; goal framing which refers to the description of the benefit brought from actions or the aftermath of no actions may significantly influence people’s motivation (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R9"><offsets xml_i="8372" xml_f="8373" txt_i="4054" txt_f="4055">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8380" xml_f="8462" txt_i="4055" txt_f="4137">). Levin, et al. found the Structure-specificity among the three kinds of frames (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R10"><offsets xml_i="8499" xml_f="8501" txt_i="4137" txt_f="4139">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8508" xml_f="8592" txt_i="4139" txt_f="4223">). Frisch suggested that the candidate options were not always required equivalent (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R11"><offsets xml_i="8629" xml_f="8631" txt_i="4223" txt_f="4225">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8638" xml_f="9430" txt_i="4225" txt_f="5017">). For example the widely used medical decision making study material provided the following situation: The decision maker should make a choice between having surgery or radiation therapy. The surgical treatment had a lower treatment survival rate, but a relatively higher 5-year survival rate; while the radiation-therapy treatment had a higher treatment survival rate, but a lower 5-year survival rate. The problem could be presented in a positive (survival rate) or negative (mortality rate) frame which might also result in the risk preference shift, though the effects of surgery and radiation therapy were not equivalent. In a recent study conducted by Wong and Kwong, a new kind of framing namely number-size framing was found, which reflected the law of diminishing marginal utility (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R12"><offsets xml_i="9467" xml_f="9469" txt_i="5017" txt_f="5019">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9476" xml_f="9598" txt_i="5019" txt_f="5141">).

For example, Bigman et al. reported that describing the effect of a human papillomavirus (HPV) prophylactic to some participants as being 70% effective (positive frame) and to others as being 30% ineffective (negative frame) produced different results. Even though there was no actual difference between the two frames, the participants who received the positive frame believed that it had a better prophylactic effect and were more willing to receive vaccine (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R13"><offsets xml_i="10247" xml_f="10249" txt_i="5747" txt_f="5749">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10256" xml_f="10416" txt_i="5749" txt_f="5909">).

Similar to a simple dichotomous scale where a participant would choose one of the two options, participants using a 6 point-scale must also favor one procedure over the other since there is no mid-point.

In an attribute frame, when the drug effect was described in a loss frame, people made significantly negative evaluation compared with described in a gain frame. This is consisting with prior research: A pound of beef can be described as “80 lean” or “20% fat”, and people give the former one better evaluation (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R10"><offsets xml_i="23130" xml_f="23132" txt_i="14151" txt_f="14153">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23139" xml_f="24110" txt_i="14153" txt_f="15124">). In a goal framing: The doctors’ advices were respectively described as the benefit brought from compliance and the aftermath of aviation. The participants complied with the later one more readily. In the classical Asia disease problem, people become conservative in a positive frame but risky in a negative frame. In the number sized framing effect, the change of the description also lead to a revision of decision making. The three types of framing effect can all be explained based on the Prospect Theory. According the model, people’s cognition of gains or losses is relative to the reference point, rather than from the absolute level of wealth. Gains and losses are evaluated differently due to the shape of value function which is concave in the gain area and convex in the loss area, reflecting the law of diminishing marginal utility. The loss function is steeper than the gain function, implying that decision makers are more sensitive to losses than gains (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R16"><offsets xml_i="24147" xml_f="24149" txt_i="15124" txt_f="15126">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24156" xml_f="24158" txt_i="15126" txt_f="15128">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R17"><offsets xml_i="24195" xml_f="24197" txt_i="15128" txt_f="15130">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24204" xml_f="26027" txt_i="15130" txt_f="16953">). In a goal framing, “Increase of the probability of catching a disease” can be regarded as a loss, while “decrease of the probability of catching a disease” can be regarded as a gain. So people complied with doctor’s advices more readily when these advices were described as the aftermath of no cooperation. In a number size framing, people are more sensitive to the change from 3 to 10, compared with the change from 190 to 197. So the former description can affect people’s decision. In the classical Asia Disease Problem, though “200 patients can be saved” and “400 patients will die” are logically equivalent, but the two descriptions are understood differently since they are separately above or under the reference point. Due to the marginal utility, the psychological value of saving 200 patients is bigger than that of 1/3 probability of saving 600, thus decision maker are conservative in positive frames. In the same way, the hurt of 2/3 probability of losing 600 lives is not as much as that of losing 400 lives for sure, then decision makers tend to be risky in negative frames. In the risk choice framing with not equivalent options: When people were informed the survival probability of treatment prospects, they were more inclined to choose the radiation therapy treatment with the short-term benefit and long-term loss than mortality. It can be explained as: When participants were informed as survival rate they regarded it as an opportunity rather than a threat; but when they were given mortality information, they thought of it as a threat more than an opportunity. Numerous studies have indicated that when the decision makers perceive opportunities more than threats, they are more inclined to take risks; in contrast, when they perceive more threats than opportunities, they are more conservative (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R18"><offsets xml_i="26064" xml_f="26066" txt_i="16953" txt_f="16955">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26073" xml_f="26075" txt_i="16955" txt_f="16957">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A8469R19"><offsets xml_i="26112" xml_f="26114" txt_i="16957" txt_f="16959">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26121" xml_f="26284" txt_i="16959" txt_f="17122">).
