The effects of LLLT on hearing loss and tinnitus have received some study, but results have been equivocal. The purpose of this study was to determine if LLLT improved hearing, speech understanding, and/or cochlear function in adults with hearing loss. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, subjects were assigned to a treatment, placebo, or control group. The treatment group was given LLLT, which consisted of shining low-level lasers onto the outer ear, head, and neck. Each laser treatment lasted approximately five minutes. Three treatments were applied within the course of one week. A battery of auditory tests was administered immediately before the first treatment and immediately after the third treatment. The battery consisted of pure-tone audiometry, the Connected Speech Test, and transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions. Data were analyzed by comparing pre- and posttest results. No statistically significant differences were found between groups for any of the auditory tests. Additionally, no clinically significant differences were found in any individual subjects. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01820416).</offsets></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title><offsets xml_i="4477" xml_f="4492" txt_i="1280" txt_f="1295">1.

Before potential subjects were enrolled in the study, they were asked a list of screening questions to determine eligibility.

The device was a portable (9′′ × 5′′ × 1′′) unit that consisted of a hand-held probe and a main body. The probe contained two laser diodes. One diode produced light in the green part of the visible light spectrum (532 nm wavelength), and the other diode produced light in the red part of the visible light spectrum (635 nm wavelength). Both diodes produced energy levels of 7.5 mW (class IIIb). The laser beams from both diodes were dispersed through lenses to create parallel line-generated beams, rather than spots. The 532 nm light was constant, and the 635 nm light was pulsed, with frequencies of 15 and 33 Hz. The pulsing alternated between frequencies every 30 seconds. A second Erchonia EHL device served as the placebo. It was identical to the treatment device, except that the laser diodes were replaced with nonfunctioning standard light-emitting diodes. </offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title><offsets xml_i="9600" xml_f="9617" txt_i="5878" txt_f="5895">2.3.

It is worth noting that a similar pattern was seen in individual frequencies: of the 300 audiometric measurements made (5 audiometric frequencies (0.5 to 8 kHz), left and right ears, 30 subjects), only one measurement showed a change greater than 10 dB. A single subject in the treatment group showed an improvement of 25 dB at 0.5 kHz in one ear. The other ear showed a 5 dB decrease. No improvement was seen in this subject's speech scores or otoacoustic emissions. The most plausible explanation is that the large threshold improvement was artifactual, in that the audiometric testing was always under the control of the subject. To summarize the audiometric test results, in addition to group means being the same, no individual subjects showed a clinically significant change in thresholds.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec4.1.2"><title><offsets xml_i="30693" xml_f="30720" txt_i="24103" txt_f="24130">4.1.2.

The current results are further evidence that LLLT does not have an effect on hearing status. In the current study, care was taken to blind the subjects, the researchers administering the treatment, and the researchers administering auditory testing. It appears that some previous studies were less careful about controlling for placebo effect and potential researcher bias. Future studies should also implement double-blinding, as well as control and placebo groups. Other factors may also explain the discrepancy in findings.
