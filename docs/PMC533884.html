Concordantly, the incidence of LBP in the RNLA is high. Acute LBP is the primary reason for soldiers to visit the general practitioner at a military health center. Chronic nonspecific LBP, defined as having complaints for at least 12 weeks, is one of the three most diagnosed disorders during consulting hours of Dutch military company doctors, and takes on average 15% of their weekly consulting hours time.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6607" xml_f="6700" txt_i="3149" txt_f="3242">Currently, there is strong evidence that exercise therapy is more effective than usual care [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="6731" xml_f="6732" txt_i="3242" txt_f="3243">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6739" xml_f="7286" txt_i="3243" txt_f="3790">]. Exercise therapy is a major part of the standard treatment by physiotherapists in the RNLA, involving an active role of the patient. In the experience of our health professionals (practitioners and physiotherapists), this active approach fits in well with the attitudes and beliefs of the target population: soldiers are taught to be aware of their physical abilities and limitations from the moment they enlist for the army.

Therefore, the search for effective and (time-) efficient exercise therapy protocols has led us to a specific form of lumbar extension training.

If, indeed, no specific dimension or type of exercise therapy is superior to one another in producing optimal therapeutic outcomes, other aspects are more relevant when introducing an intervention program, such as: treatment affinity, expectation and compliance of patient and provider, costs, facilities, and personnel capacity.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10494" xml_f="11976" txt_i="6628" txt_f="8110">From this perspective, back strength and endurance training in CLBP patients with the use of training devices is an interesting concept for our military population. RNLA personnel are, from their very first initial military education, used to participate in physical exercise programs, including progressive resistance training on exercise machines. The RNLA is well equipped with an extensive line of modern fitness devices on all major military locations throughout the country, including state-of-the-art lower back machines. Moreover, protocolized treatment sessions with our training device take no longer than 5 to 10 minutes once or twice a week from both patient and provider, compared to (on an average) 30 minutes in regular treatment sessions. We expect this time efficiency to be highly appreciated by our personnel, who work in a typical military culture of "running into extremes": relatively quiet (maintenance) periods on the military base are interspersed with extremely busy periods shortly before and during out-of-area operations. For several target groups, longstanding and time-consuming rehabilitation programs are out of the question. For instance, recruits who drop out of their initial training because of (back) injuries, need to return as quick as possible to prevent a stagnation in their military career. For soldiers standing by for military operations, everything revolves around the mission when being commanded to be prepared within the next weeks.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11983" xml_f="12321" txt_i="8111" txt_f="8449">A second reason for our approach is that the majority of studies on LBP management consist of multimodal interventions, which include physical, behavioral, educational and/or ergonomic elements. To obtain a better view on the (relative) efficacy of either of these concepts, unimodal intervention programs like ours need to be evaluated [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="12352" xml_f="12353" txt_i="8449" txt_f="8450">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12360" xml_f="12361" txt_i="8450" txt_f="8451">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="12392" xml_f="12393" txt_i="8451" txt_f="8452">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12400" xml_f="13038" txt_i="8452" txt_f="9090">]. Besides, we strongly believe that exercise as the primary entrance for restoring back function has a wide span of treatment effects, including improvements for cognitive and/pr behavioral variables. Although exercise has a primary goal of improving functioning of targeted tissues, successful completion of exercise protocols in the presence of chronic pain may for example lead to a reduction in pain-related fears. As standardized exercise on a training machine is based on measured performance (number of kilograms and repetitions), patients are continuously given numerical feedback regarding their increasing physical capacities [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="13069" xml_f="13070" txt_i="9090" txt_f="9091">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13077" xml_f="13190" txt_i="9091" txt_f="9204">].

For instance, behavioral therapy is mainly focused on issues that are prevalent in chronic patients, such as low feelings of self-control or fear of movement/(re-)injury. Since the population of the present study, military employees of the RNLA, is a working population with mostly short-term, intermittent and moderately severe LBP, we chose to apply a more physical approach. As we have seen in our previous research (see the next paragraph), this links well with the health perceptions of our target population, in which perceived health problems were not severe and much more focused on physical than on mental aspects.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14054" xml_f="14190" txt_i="10056" txt_f="10192">Fourth, the efficacy of isolated extension training in chronic back patients has been studied by several other research groups as well [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><offsets xml_i="14222" xml_f="14224" txt_i="10192" txt_f="10194">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14231" xml_f="14669" txt_i="10194" txt_f="10632">].
