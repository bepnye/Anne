New information and communication technologies (ICT) must be culturally acceptable if they are to be effective in daily clinical practice, rather than just in the context of a controlled trial.

Acceptability centers on perception of an innovation (ie, ICT tool) as clusters of perceived attributes. These can be categorized as follows, using ART as an example: (1) perceived inherent attributes (eg, ART is effective or requires scheduling); (2) perceived associational attributes (eg, ART demands periodic clinic visits; is encouraged by medical personnel, but perhaps not by others); and (3) perceived effects (eg, lifestyle and other changes). Each perceived attribute has cultural meaning, and the individual continually weighs the positive and negative aspects of the attributes throughout treatment. The resulting balancing act influences the acceptability of the intervention. Cultural and linguistic factors determine the perception of relevancy of these attributes, as well as other factors, such as age, life cycle stage, health status, motivation to be healthier, and perceptions of the source of the information and intervention [</offsets><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="16007" xml_f="16009" txt_i="6928" txt_f="6930">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16016" xml_f="16017" txt_i="6930" txt_f="6931">,</offsets><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="16051" xml_f="16053" txt_i="6931" txt_f="6933">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16060" xml_f="16062" txt_i="6933" txt_f="6935">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16069" xml_f="16632" txt_i="6936" txt_f="7499">The study aims were to (1) conduct usability testing of CARE+ Spanish; (2) establish a real-world utility of CARE+ Spanish by conducting a 12-month longitudinal randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of the CARE+ Spanish intervention on outcomes, which included ART adherence, sexual transmission risk behaviors, and HIV-1 viral loads; and (3) to assess technology uptake factors, explore the cultural acceptability of the tool, and perceived technology barriers/facilitators among participants and health care providers using the TAM framework.</offsets></p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="16678" xml_f="16686" txt_i="7500" txt_f="7508">Figure 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="16706" xml_f="16735" txt_i="7508" txt_f="7537">Screenshots of CARE+ Spanish.</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v18i7e195_fig1"></graphic></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="16844" xml_f="16851" txt_i="7539" txt_f="7546">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16862" xml_f="17145" txt_i="7547" txt_f="7830">The CARE+ program incorporates motivational interviewing and principles of chronic HIV disease self-management to enhance health-promoting behavior.

Given budgetary constraints, and the large amount of software content, an expert panel review was utilized in place of back translation of the CARE+ tool. The expert panel consisted of clinical experts who were bilingual and bicultural with ancestry from major Latino subgroups (ie, Mexican and Puerto Rican). For the forward translation, a translator with a master’s degree experienced with HIV health-related materials translated the CARE+ content into Spanish. Because the professional translator’s work had been used with predominantly Mexican-American populations, a member of our study team (JAP), who is of Puerto Rican origin and has experience in AIDS research with Mexican and Puerto Rican populations, took on the role of assuring quality of translation and applicability across Latino subgroups. Additionally, there was a secondary reviewer, a health educator and curriculum writer with a master of public health, who has done substantial translation work for HIV interventions in California, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Northeastern United States. She performed final reviews of the translated software content. Spanish-speaking actors of Mexican and Colombian heritage recorded the narration, and text changes were also made if the two voice actors reading the script made recommendations. Then, a panel of bilingual HIV health care providers (two physicians, a nurse practitioner, a nurse, and a health educator) reviewed the translation of the content independently to confirm the appropriateness of the terminology and the minimization of idiomatic regional expressions unique to their culture. After discussion to reach consensus, words identified as idiomatic were deleted and substituted with words that were not specific to only one Latino subgroup. Furthermore, an additional local expert advisory panel (composed of one Spanish-speaking person living with HIV, and HIV providers from medicine, nursing, and social work) was convened in New York City to review the CARE+ Spanish tool content and shorten it for use in a real-world high-volume HIV clinic setting. Once a test-ready version of CARE+ Spanish was available, the program was tested with HIV-positive Spanish-speaking individuals to explore acceptability and usability of the intervention.

However, some did feel there was a difference if the issue(s) related to documentation (ie, “having papers”). One participant noted, “illegal status, it leaves us without options.” Another participant shared additional comments regarding obstacles faced by their undocumented status: “Of course, because we are immigrants and we don’t have legal papers to get around or anything.” Some noted that English-speaking/non-Latinos have more information and receive different care. Other participants discussed the problems Latinos face that keep them from focusing on their illness, fears of engaging in care, not trusting to reveal their diagnosis, parents not teaching their children about safer sex, and fears relating to stigma and discrimination: “Spanish people appear stronger around other(s) and don’t share their weakness” and “Latinos have machista behavior in not taking care of themselves...” Language barriers were a concern in accessing information, understanding, and being understood by providers and navigating the health care system.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="54119" xml_f="54190" txt_i="32548" txt_f="32619">Multiple Sources of Information Related to Human Immunodeficiency Virus</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="54201" xml_f="54723" txt_i="32620" txt_f="33142">Participants reported a range of resources for obtaining HIV-related and general health information.

Another discussed using withdrawal when his viral load is undetectable. A few participants stated that their providers did not discuss this topic with them.

Regarding sex, some reported preferring to speak with a provider of the same sex or same sexual orientation. A few did not have any discussions regarding medications or sex with their providers: “They don’t have the time.” Another participant summed up her sexual situation and the need to discuss it as follows: “There’s not much to say, my status was so traumatic that I don’t believe in love.”</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="58196" xml_f="58243" txt_i="36549" txt_f="36596">CARE+ Spanish Computer-Based Counseling Program</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="58254" xml_f="58811" txt_i="36597" txt_f="37154">The majority of participants reported a positive experience with using the tablet computer.

The availability of the peers was viewed as an overwhelmingly positive aspect of the program.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="60140" xml_f="61022" txt_i="38465" txt_f="39347">Although the majority of those interviewed preferred the program in Spanish, some would have preferred to have an English version available and some thought having both languages would work best for them. (This is important to note for any replication in an urban environment where the population is likely to include acculturated and bilingual individuals.) Nearly all participants stated that they would use the program again to pass the time while waiting in the clinic, and when new information could be provided. Some would use it at every visit, whereas most opted for a few times a year. A few participants were clear in not wanting to use the computer program again; one person disliked the voice of the narrator and the other was uncomfortable with the computer. One participant stated that the program might be good for new clients at the clinic or newly diagnosed people.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="61029" xml_f="61769" txt_i="39348" txt_f="40088">Overall, the CARE+ Spanish program was viewed positively. Most participants used it to improve their health, learn their medications (eg “Showed me how much I know, tested me on what I knew, allowed me to be honest with myself”), and change some behavior (eg “I loved it! I learned so much and because of this I slowed down my sex life and am more careful”). Although some participants saw the program as an important part of their care by asking questions of their providers, others did not, seeing it as not relevant to their lives (eg “the long explanations of topics that were not relevant to me”). The spectrum of responses received in the exit interview reflects the diversity of the study population, Latinos living in New York City.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="61797" xml_f="61830" txt_i="40091" txt_f="40124">Health Care Provider Focus Groups</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="61841" xml_f="62275" txt_i="40125" txt_f="40559">The first focus group was conducted on February 21, 2012 with seven participants.

Participants included five medical doctors and three nurse practitioners. Years in health care ranged from 14 to 29 years and years in HIV care ranged from 11 to 14 years. There were three bilingual providers present.

However, this was a general finding and not specific to Latino patients. One provider reported that not using condoms makes the patient feel “normal” (eg, “I don’t feel sick with HIV when I don’t use a condom”). Other adherence obstacles that are in agreement with findings from the RCT exit interviews include substance abuse, lack of documentation, stigma, and trauma. According to one provider, trauma is a “huge, huge factor” because it affects people, their belief in their right to protect themselves, and their expectations that intimate encounters are at least safe for both parties. Overall, providers were in agreement that “like a hydra head,” when one issue gets addressed, another comes up.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="63622" xml_f="64455" txt_i="41888" txt_f="42721">Regarding the usefulness of the CARE+ Spanish tool, providers agreed that multiple approaches are important (eg “more education is always good”) and that patients may feel more empowered to have a resource (eg “an education tool” and “a health enhancement tool”) they can access without help. However, they felt that there are no substitutes for the provider-patient relationship, personalism in Latino culture, and loyalty to a provider: “...technology might not have the same impact.” Although intervention participants had the option to share their health promotion plan printout and discuss their study participation with their provider, the providers reported that none of the participants did. Therefore, a significant limitation on provider feedback about the CARE+ Spanish program was their lack of familiarity with the tool.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="64525" xml_f="64542" txt_i="42725" txt_f="42742">Principal Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="64553" xml_f="65573" txt_i="42743" txt_f="43763">The CARE+ computer-based counseling tool adapted for a Spanish-speaking population (CARE+ Spanish) was acceptable and feasible to implement in an urban clinic setting. Participants liked the ease of use and the sense of privacy and confidentiality that the computer-based counseling tool provided. The health care providers agreed that multiple approaches are needed and that the counseling tool can be an additional resource for HIV care and support. The CARE+ Spanish program demonstrated trends in positive impact in reducing viral loads, increasing ART adherence and decreasing risky sexual behaviors in three comprehensive care clinics in New York City. In the CARE+ Spanish trial, differences between arms were not statistically significant. In contrast, the CARE+ computer-based counseling tool, when evaluated in a university-affiliated public HIV clinic and a community-based AIDS service organization in Seattle, was found to be efficacious in reducing HIV-1 viral load and sexual transmission risk behaviors [</offsets><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="65606" xml_f="65607" txt_i="43763" txt_f="43764">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="65614" xml_f="65938" txt_i="43764" txt_f="44088">].

Exit interviews from intervention participants and focus groups with providers highlight the efficacy of computer-based counseling tools in overcoming adherence challenges experienced by culturally and linguistically diverse communities, especially stigma.

The computer-based audio-narrated risk assessment that both groups received at baseline may have been enough to support the maintenance of adherence in both groups, and the positive trend noted in the treatment group explained by the impact of the full intervention. Additionally, health provider acceptability is important for any ICT tool that aims to be incorporated into real-world practice. Therefore, although the CARE+ Spanish intervention was developed as a stand-alone computer-based counseling tool, participants did receive a printout of their session that they could use to initiate conversation with their provider about adherence support and risk reduction. Instead, providers were unfamiliar with the CARE+ Spanish program and reported that participants did not share the health plan printouts with them. Although not a specific outcome measure, the lack of familiarity with the specifics of the program and the session printout, from the providers, may highlight that the participants were not engaging their providers on this aspect of their self-care, and this may have been a factor in reducing the effect of the intervention. Potential improvement of this counseling intervention may be developing a mobile cloud-based platform to support users in self-motivated behavioral change for better health. Additionally, targeting the intervention to individuals with adherence and/or sexual transmission risk problems may be another way of improving the program’s effectiveness.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="69158" xml_f="69465" txt_i="47067" txt_f="47374">An innovative strength of our study is the use of peers to support ICT use in a clinic setting for an important and often-neglected population that is disproportionately affected by HIV disease burden.

We found that language preferences and cultural acceptability of a computer-based counseling tool exist on a continuum in our urban Spanish-speaking population.
