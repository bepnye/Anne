Twenty-four women agreed to participate and completed the baseline survey. However, of those, 25% (n = 6) did not return the consent form in time to participate in the study, despite an enclosed stamped self addressed envelope and reminder phone call. Eighteen women received the study emails, 17 kept their preventive health appointment, and of those, 16 filled out the final email survey (18–25 group: intervention n = 2, control n = 2; 50–65 group: intervention n = 5, control n = 7).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18557" xml_f="19260" txt_i="13097" txt_f="13800">Because of the difficulties in recruiting and maintaining participants, there is limited ability to compare secondary outcomes in the intervention and control groups. Regardless, according to follow-up survey responses there appeared to be little difference by arm in the number of topics covered in the preventive health visit or in the receipt of screening tests, although intervention group women aged 50–65 were more likely than controls (4 of 5 vs 4 of 7) to have received fetal occult blood test screening. More relevant to the primary aims, all respondents in the intervention arm (both 18–25 and 50–65 age groups) said they would like to continue receiving health education emails in the future.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19288" xml_f="19298" txt_i="13803" txt_f="13813">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19309" xml_f="19772" txt_i="13814" txt_f="14277">Our survey results look promising for the future utilization of patient-initiated electronic communication in family practice clinics.

From a research perspective, beyond the usual difficulties in establishing initial contact and study refusals, studies based on electronic communication lose potential participants because of lack of access to email and difficulties in the paper-based consent process. One-quarter of recruited participants failed to return the consent form, indicating that a mail-based element in an otherwise electronic intervention can have a strong negative impact on recruitment. Salient to both research and to regular clinical communication, of the few women enrolled in the trial, two had problems receiving the emails sent from the clinic: multiple messages bounced back with the explanation that the 'mailbox was full'. When dealing with email from the physician to the patient, the patients may be less concerned with technological issues than if they initiate the contact themselves.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21446" xml_f="21807" txt_i="15895" txt_f="16256">Roughly 76% of women recruited for the prevention study had access to email, a slightly higher number than we found in the general population.

Conversely, it is important to note that women of lower socioeconomic status, as indicated by enrollment in Medicaid, were disproportionately ineligible to take part in the study because of their lack of access to email.

Our study showed that Medicaid patients and black patients were less likely to have access to email, and that these groups also had a higher mean number of annual visits to the clinic.

Regarding study design, it would have been helpful to collect demographic information on those patients identified as not having an email address. This would have provided additional insight into the influence of age, income, and gender on access to email in our patient population. Also, we chose to utilize dichotomous questions for our survey instead of Likert scales. Although Likert scales, which allow the respondent to indicate levels of agreement or disagreement, would have provided more detail about 'interest level' in our patients, we used dichotomous questions to minimize the time required to complete the survey in our waiting room, and also to avoid the central tendency bias and acquiescence bias common to Likert questions [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"><offsets xml_i="23645" xml_f="23647" txt_i="17939" txt_f="17941">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23654" xml_f="23656" txt_i="17941" txt_f="17943">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23663" xml_f="24165" txt_i="17944" txt_f="18446">Our study on the feasibility of clinic-initiated email was limited by the small number of patients completing the study and by a single clinic site.

Among those women who participated in our feasibility study and received emailed health education materials, there was a high level of interest in receiving future emails from the clinic. This approach to using email – to initiate health-related information exchange from the clinic to the patient – has not been widely reported.
