Multidisciplinary treatment of at least 100 hours, combining exercise therapy, functional restoration and CBT appeared promising in comparison to other non-multidisciplinary treatments, whereas multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs of less than 30 hours failed to prove improvements on several relevant outcome measures.

As a result, it is not clear whether the improvement is reached by the CBT itself, the exercise therapy or the combination of both. Furthermore, many exercise therapies were not of sufficient intensity, frequency and duration to fulfil the physiologic training principles and therefore should not be classified as real reconditioning or strengthening therapies [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="10800" xml_f="10802" txt_i="5602" txt_f="5604">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10809" xml_f="10810" txt_i="5604" txt_f="5605">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"><offsets xml_i="10842" xml_f="10844" txt_i="5605" txt_f="5607">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10851" xml_f="10852" txt_i="5607" txt_f="5608">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="10884" xml_f="10886" txt_i="5608" txt_f="5610">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10893" xml_f="11393" txt_i="5610" txt_f="6110">]. On the basis of the current available research, it appears that the evidence for the effectiveness of model-based treatments is still scarce and many programs used several different treatment techniques often based on several models without knowing what treatment elements or combinations are really necessary to reach positive treatment results. Therefore we designed treatments that are exclusively based on the deconditioning model, the cognitive behavioral model and the biopsychosocial model.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11400" xml_f="11745" txt_i="6111" txt_f="6456">The aim of the current study was to compare the effectiveness of a physical treatment (APT), a cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) and a combination of both (CT) by means of a randomized controlled trial.

Even both problems might be present. So it might be possible that patients only receiving physical treatment will enhance their aerobic capacity, muscle strength and endurance, but there might also be patients who do not resume their normal daily activities because of for example maladaptive beliefs or avoidance behavior. These problems might even hamper successful physical training. Otherwise people receiving cognitive behavioral treatment might be willing to increase their activity level but physical deconditioning might prevent this. By combining both treatments it seems plausible that more people might decrease their level of functional limitations and therefore it is hypothesized that the combination of APT and CBT shows a larger difference than APT or CBT alone.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12694" xml_f="12836" txt_i="7393" txt_f="7535">This paper reports on the immediate post-treatment effects.

The patient performed three sessions of 15–18 repetitions. The exercises started gradually with in the first week one exercise per session, two exercises in the second week and three in the third week. After five sessions of performing an exercise, the patient performed a test to establish the 70% of the 1-RM again. The three exercises consisted of leg extension while sitting on knees and hands, trunk lifting and lifting both legs while lying prone on a couch. During the exercises assistive weight by a pulley system or extra weight placed on the body of the patient were used depending on the calculated load (70% of 1-RM). The increment of load was based on the performance of the patient and not on the judgment of the therapists. Only when a patient reported change in pain pattern (e.g. radiation to one leg), the rehabilitation physician was asked whether the training had to be adjusted (dynamic instead of dynamic-static, lowering of load or temporary not performing an exercise). After the dynamic-static exercises the patient stretched the trunk and leg muscles again during five minutes. Two physiotherapists guided a maximum of four patients at a time.

The patient selected three activities that were of the highest importance but compromised by the pain problem. After the establishment of a baseline, the activity tolerance level was calculated and final treatment goals were set. The patient started performing the selected activities following quotas for each day, starting from 70 to 80% of the baseline with gradually increasing activity levels towards the final treatment goals. The patient was instructed only to perform the agreed amount of activity and not perform less or more, even when he felt capable of doing so. During the training sessions the patient performed one or more of the selected activities, but the most important part of the treatment session was the evaluation of the amount of the activities the patient had performed at home. The patient graphically registered in a personal diary his daily performance. The therapists were instructed to discuss these graphs regularly with the patient, while positively reinforcing any progress towards the pre-set goals. In order to create as much contrast as possible with the APT, no physical training element (e.g. muscle strength or aerobic exercises) was incorporated. Graded activity consisted of two introductory group meetings followed by 18 individual sessions guided by a skilled physiotherapist or occupational therapist.

But even in our study, CT showed no additional effect. This might be caused by the relative low compliance rate in CT. Furthermore the total treatment intensity might have been a crucial factor for obtaining an additional effect. Although the CT had a total duration of 78 hours, this is still lower than the 100 hours of therapy in daily intensive CT-programs showing an additional effect when compared to non-multidisciplinary treatment [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="51182" xml_f="51183" txt_i="42601" txt_f="42602">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="51190" xml_f="51562" txt_i="42602" txt_f="42974">]. Furthermore no functional restoration was applied. On the other hand, we cannot rule out that the mixture of APT and CBT had an oppositional effect. For example, the increase of exercise load in APT was based on training physiology, and the increase of activity in CBT was based on time-contingency, which could have obscured the supplemental effect of both treatments.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51569" xml_f="52138" txt_i="42975" txt_f="43544">By using the WL as reference treatment it cannot be ruled out that the positive effects of all active treatments were caused by other non-specific factors such as attention, a standardized treatment program, or emphasis on active participation. Otherwise, by using the WL we were able to control for time effects showing that the WL did not improve or deteriorate on all outcome measures.

In order to avoid possible confounding within all treatment elements, therapists were trained only to deliver one specific treatment element in the single and combination treatment as well. Therefore it was not possible to keep the therapists blinded. The patients could not be blinded because of ethical reasons. However, before randomization the patients were told that all active treatments are effective, but that the exact effectiveness is not yet clear. Furthermore, patients with an absolute preference for one treatment were excluded. Concealment of randomization was successfully achieved since no one of the referring physicians was aware of the type of treatment the referred patient would be randomized to.

The improvement on performance tasks mainly occurred in APT and CT. This might be due to an increase of aerobic capacity or endurance strength. Otherwise, several patients did not report difficulties in, for example stair climbing, and for them a ceiling effect for this particular task seemed to apply. Furthermore, the performance tasks were possibly not specific enough to detect a change in the ability to perform patient relevant activities. For instance when a patient wanted to improve his walking distance, he would have increased the distance and not the speed. Because of this, the five-minute walking task probably would not change dramatically.
