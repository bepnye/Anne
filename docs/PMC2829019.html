A total score of zero represents good adherence and a score of one or more represents suboptimal adherence. The TABS is another self-reported adherence measure, which was originally developed in Australian patients using chronic medicines.

HAPPY trial is unique because we have taken into consideration the 'Hawthorne effect' in the UCG by having a third group of patients (HCG) who are taking or have taken antihypertensives in the previous six months but not included in the UCG. In addition, UCG pharmacists and their patient participants will not be disadvantaged as, after the study period is completed, they will be offered the intervention package tested in the PCG, a strategy that is expected to enhance participant retention.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="31798" xml_f="31816" txt_i="23260" txt_f="23278">Trial registration</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31827" xml_f="31893" txt_i="23279" txt_f="23345">Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN12609000705280</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="31915" xml_f="31928" txt_i="23347" txt_f="23360">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31939" xml_f="32311" txt_i="23361" txt_f="23733">BP: Blood pressure; TABS: Tool for Adherence Behaviour Screening; RCT: Randomised Controlled Trial; PhARIA: Pharmacy Access/Remoteness Index of Australia; CVD: Cardiovascular disease; PCG: Pharmacist Care Group; UCG: Usual Care Group; HCG: Hidden Control Group; HMR: Home medicines review; DAA: Dose administration aid; PMP: Patient medication profile; and MUR: Medication</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="32333" xml_f="32352" txt_i="23735" txt_f="23754">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32363" xml_f="32421" txt_i="23755" txt_f="23813">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="32443" xml_f="32465" txt_i="23815" txt_f="23837">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32476" xml_f="32816" txt_i="23838" txt_f="24178">RL is the project manager of Happy Trial and wrote the first draft of the manuscript with input from JMcD, DB and JG.
