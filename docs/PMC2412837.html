In addition, these obstetric-gynaecological variables will be recorded: gestational age when subject was included in the study, determined by foetal biometry; type of presentation, determined by echography (characterized as breech, oblique or transverse presentation); foetal biometry (biparietal diameter, abdominal diameter and length of femur) [week of gestation when biometry is performed]; location of the placenta (categorized as anterolateral or posterior), parity (number of previous births), and previous miscarriages.

The security variables determined during the treatment will be recorded on the self-reported questionnaire which is completed by the subjects after each home treatment session, with data on foetal movements, uterine contractions, maternal heartbeat and any other incident following the stimulation.

In designing the present study, special care was taken regarding the characteristics conforming a quality RCT, in accordance with the recommendations made by Jadad [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"><offsets xml_i="28618" xml_f="28620" txt_i="21369" txt_f="21371">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="28627" xml_f="30008" txt_i="21371" txt_f="22752">]. Nevertheless, the following foreseeable limitations should be pointed out: firstly, the sample was extracted from the universe of pregnancies managed within the Andalusian Public Healthcare System (SSPA), and therefore the conclusions drawn will only be applicable to this population group. The complexity of including private clinics in the study led us to renounce this idea, especially in view of the fact that the coverage of the pregnancy control programme within the public system is almost universal; moreover, the pregnant women who make use of private systems do not stop receiving the follow-up attention scheduled under the public healthcare system. From the bibliographic review performed, neither does it seem that social class influences the incidence of breech presentation or its version during gestation. It is very likely, therefore, that the results obtained will resemble those that would be derived for the entire population of pregnant women in Andalusia. The inclusion of a routine control of the official programme (an echography performed in week 32) also avoids possible selection bias. Thus, with the involvement of the gynaecologist performing this examination, and of the midwife who participates in routine care, the uptake is ensured of 100% of the cases of NCP detected during the study period, while the rate of losses to follow up is minimised.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30015" xml_f="30572" txt_i="22753" txt_f="23310">Secondly, there exists the possibility (which has actually occurred in other studies) of a pregnant woman refusing to take part when she discovers which branch of the research study she has been assigned to. This is applicable to the formation of the control group, as normally any intervention (whether true or sham moxibustion) will be willingly accepted by a pregnant woman in a situation of some risk. In the studies examined, this has actually occurred in only a very small percentage of cases, but note should be taken of this possible source of bias.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30579" xml_f="30956" txt_i="23311" txt_f="23688">Thirdly, in designing the present study, we decided upon self-implementation of the intervention procedure, rather than calling upon an expert in acupuncture to apply it.
