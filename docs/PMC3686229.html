Widespread mobile phone use presents new opportunities to engage patients in care. A randomised controlled trial (RCT), WelTel Kenya1, demonstrated that weekly text messages led to improved ART adherence and viral load suppression among those initiating ART. The aim of this study was to determine whether the WelTel intervention is an effective and cost-effective method of improving retention in care in the first year of care following HIV diagnosis.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7711" xml_f="7731" txt_i="653" txt_f="673">Methods and analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7742" xml_f="8579" txt_i="674" txt_f="1511">WelTel Retain is an open, parallel group RCT that will be conducted at the Kibera Community Health Centre in Nairobi, Kenya. Over a 1-year period, we aim to recruit 686 individuals newly diagnosed with HIV who will be randomly allocated to an intervention or control arm (standard care) at a 1:1 ratio. Intervention arm participants will receive the weekly WelTel SMS ‘check-in’ to which they will be instructed to respond within 48 h. An HIV clinician will follow-up and triage any problems that are identified. Participants will be followed for 1 year, with a primary endpoint of retention in care at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include retention in stage 1 HIV care (patients return to the clinic to receive their first CD4 results) and timely ART initiation. Cost-effectiveness will be analysed through decision-analytic modelling.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8601" xml_f="8625" txt_i="1513" txt_f="1537">Ethics and dissemination</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8636" xml_f="9031" txt_i="1538" txt_f="1933">Ethical approval has been obtained from the University of British Columbia and the African Medical and Research Foundation.

which is the basis of one of our trial outcomes: retention in stage 1 HIV care. Our definition includes their proposed start point (first positive HIV test) and outcome (first ART eligibility assessment (patient returns to the clinic to receive the results of their CD4 count)). Tracking retention in stage 1 care is facilitated at the trial site because patients who test positive at the clinic commonly receive HIV care at the clinic (thereby eliminating a referral process in patients who receive a diagnosis at a stand-alone testing centre). Recent changes in clinical practice at KCHC aimed at improving patient enrolment have further simplified processes at this stage. Patients who test positive for HIV have a CD4 test at the same visit, eliminating the extra step of having to return to the clinic to have CD4 testing done. Given the truncated stage 1 care procedures at the clinic site, we have chosen to measure retention in stage 1 at care at 3 weeks, rather than at Fox </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="29023" xml_f="29028" txt_i="15758" txt_f="15763">et al</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="29037" xml_f="29039" txt_i="15763" txt_f="15765">'s</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><offsets xml_i="29071" xml_f="29073" txt_i="15765" txt_f="15767">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="29080" xml_f="29121" txt_i="15767" txt_f="15808"> proposed time points of 3 and 12 months.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29128" xml_f="29377" txt_i="15809" txt_f="16058">For those initially deemed to be ART-ineligible, stage 2 HIV care is the time from completing the first ART eligibility assessment to ART eligibility, while stage 3 is the period from when a patient learns of their ART eligibility to ART initiation.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><offsets xml_i="29409" xml_f="29411" txt_i="16058" txt_f="16060">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="29418" xml_f="30385" txt_i="16060" txt_f="17027"> We will recruit participants at the time of their first positive HIV test, at which point the intervention is randomly allocated; therefore, we are precluded from measuring whether the intervention has an effect on retention in stages 2 or 3 of pre-ART HIV care, that is, because participants’ baseline does not coincide with the start of the time period for later stages of pre-ART HIV care.

Through this trial, we will be able to determine whether the WelTel text-messaging intervention, by engaging patients with the clinic on a weekly basis, is a cost-effective way to help promote retention in this critical stage of HIV care.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="55146" xml_f="55168" txt_i="39745" txt_f="39767">Supplementary Material</offsets></title><supplementary-material id="d35e321" content-type="local-data"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="55255" xml_f="55274" txt_i="39768" txt_f="39787">Author's manuscript</offsets></title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003155.draft_revisions.pdf"></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the patients who participated in pretesting the questionnaire, the staff at the African Medical and Research Foundation and the Kibera Community Health Centre; the DSMB members and Jasmina Memetovic for her assistance with figures.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MLVDK and RTL conceived the study.
