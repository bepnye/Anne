In contrast, both the implementing effort and the additional workload would be overrated, if only considered in a short-term perspective. Since the electronic self-assessment could be reused in future courses, the implementation costs per term decrease drastically. And, as suggested by informal feedback from the students, the additional workload induced by the repeated tests reduced the workload necessary for preparing for the final exam.

Thus, it is not clear so far, whether suitably designed repeated testing can support training in higher level RE&amp;C skills as well. Students with high initial numeracy score did not profit equally from repeated testing in RE&amp;C. As a consequence, opting out of repeated testing could be offered to this subgroup in the future with the provision of initial student profiling.
