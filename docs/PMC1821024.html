In particular, data on quality of life is rarely reported. This is especially important because patients treated with hydrotherapy often report an enhanced sense of well-being. We report a randomised controlled trial in which we compared the effects of hydrotherapy with exercises on land on overall response to treatment, physical function and quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="4185" xml_f="4192" txt_i="588" txt_f="595">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4203" xml_f="4895" txt_i="596" txt_f="1288">One hundred and fifteen patients with RA were randomised to receive a weekly 30-minute session of hydrotherapy or similar exercises on land for 6 weeks. Our primary outcome was a self-rated global impression of change – a measure of treatment effect on a 7-point scale ranging from 1(very much worse) to 7 (very much better) assessed immediately on completion of treatment. Secondary outcomes including EuroQol health related quality of life, EuroQol health status valuation, HAQ, 10 metre walk time and pain scores were collected at baseline, after treatment and 3 months later.

Ten metre walk time improved after treatment in both cases (median pre-treatment time for both groups combined 10.9 seconds, post-treatment 9.1 s, and 3 months later 9.6 s). There was however no difference between treatment groups.

Those defaulting more than 3 sessions were considered to be treatment failures but were followed up, if possible, to obtain study data. Written instructions on home exercises were provided at the outset to all patients. Patients were not required to do exercises between treatment sessions but could do so if they chose. The physiotherapist who had assessed eligibility supervised treatment in both groups, with support from two other senior physiotherapists. A rolling treatment programme was operated for convenience, therefore group sizes varied between 1 to 4 for hydrotherapy and 1 to 6 for land exercises.

The absence of benefit in health utility measures or in self rated global health scores indicates that hydrotherapy would not be judged cost effective because of the additional resources needed for hydrotherapy. A formal economic study of hydrotherapy for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, based in part at our institution, also concluded that hydrotherapy would not be cost-effective [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"><offsets xml_i="24792" xml_f="24794" txt_i="17026" txt_f="17028">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24801" xml_f="24902" txt_i="17028" txt_f="17129">].

We assessed self reported change in health on the day treatment was completed but our primary outcome was not evaluated 3 months post treatment. This was an important limitation of our study. We believed, however, that it was important to capture the direct impact of exercises since our pragmatic study design did not restrict use of other interventions, including use of corticosteroids during the study. Later assessment of our primary outcome may have been confounded by recall bias and other interventions in the weeks after completion of exercises. Many patients changed their drug therapies or received steroid injections especially in the 3 months post treatment, although the proportions of patients changing therapy were similar in the two groups. A pragmatic design is important for aiding policy decisions about therapeutic resources [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="26006" xml_f="26008" txt_i="18117" txt_f="18119">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26015" xml_f="26218" txt_i="18119" txt_f="18322">].

Use of different therapists could have led to important differences in approach to patients' problems or in outcomes because of differences in the abilities of physiotherapists to motivate and heal patients. However, we acknowledge that a conscious or subconscious preference for one or other treatment by the treating therapist may have influenced outcomes. In order to improve internal validity (reliability of the result) outcomes were patient-centred and an independent assessor collected outcomes. We also ensured that group sizes were similar so that therapeutic benefits from being part of a group were similar. It is known that, in addition to the physiological and cardiovascular benefits of exercise, exercise classes also provide opportunities for socialisation and mutual support, and that both are important determinants of continued exercise [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="27293" xml_f="27295" txt_i="19359" txt_f="19361">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27302" xml_f="27304" txt_i="19361" txt_f="19363">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27311" xml_f="27403" txt_i="19364" txt_f="19456">Failure to adhere to exercises is a common human failing mirrored in people with arthritis [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="27435" xml_f="27437" txt_i="19456" txt_f="19458">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27444" xml_f="27576" txt_i="19458" txt_f="19590">].
