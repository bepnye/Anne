This type of trial focuses on the evaluation of the benefit of a treatment when applied in a community service setting under research sampling and assessment conditions. Its design has features that maintain internal and construct validity, while the treatment is evaluated under ‘real world’ clinical conditions that enhance external validity and generalizability. Generalizability features include engagement of sites with ethnically and racially diverse populations, few inclusion and exclusion participant criteria, use of community clinicians, a flexible approach to treatment application, and clinical training and supervision consistent with service environments. Aspects of efficacy designs that are maintained in the proposed study are: random assignment of patients into STAIR Narrative Therapy (SNT) or Treatment as Usual (TAU), use of reliable and standardized diagnosis assessment measures, and use of a manual to guide the protocol treatment and relatively intensive quality assurance of diagnostic assessments and of adherence to the treatment protocol.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10991" xml_f="12059" txt_i="4980" txt_f="6048">The study also incorporates several elements of implementation science research. Clinicians are encouraged to use the SNT protocol in a flexible manner within clear limits, according to the symptoms, needs, and preferences of the specific patient. We view the incorporation of clinician-driven decisions regarding application of the protocol as an important ingredient in facilitating the use and dissemination of EBTs in the community. We will conduct exploratory analyses identifying implementation patterns and their relationship to outcomes for patients and also examine the influence of therapist and organizational characteristics likely to impact implementation. These include, but are not limited to, therapists’ attitudes about the intervention and administrative support for implementation of the intervention within the service. The study also introduces web-based technology as a resource intended to strengthen clinical networks and maintain use of study materials about which we will obtain qualitative data from clinicians regarding its perceived value.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12066" xml_f="13063" txt_i="6049" txt_f="7046">This article provides a description of the study design and reasons for design decisions such the selection of TAU as a comparator and the use of flexible delivery of SNT. These choices were intended to increase clinical realism and the generalizability of findings. However, they also added to the complexity of the study. The selection of TAU, which in a multisite study differs from site to site, requires consideration about how to characterize and assess TAU interventions and analytic techniques that take between-site variability in TAU into account. Similarly, the use of a flexible delivery of the test treatment incorporates clinician judgment and supports patient-centered care, but requires careful consideration about how to define and ensure adherence to the protocol. The study description below provides an example of the issues encountered in hybrid efficacy-effectiveness clinical trials. We present the rationale for our decisions and the scientific literature that guided them.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13070" xml_f="13944" txt_i="7047" txt_f="7921">The study has two aims: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of SNT relative to TAU primarily in regards to PTSD symptom reduction and secondarily in regards to treatment attendance, attrition, and therapist and patient satisfaction, and (2) to explore the relationship between variations in SNT treatment implementation and outcome relative to baseline severity of illness (for example, PTSD severity, GAF score). In addition, the study will obtain qualitative data concerning therapist and staff attitudes about contextual variables (for example, administrative support, clinic resources) including the use of technology (SNT resource website) that facilitate or impede implementation of the EBT and will explore their relationship to intervention delivery and outcome. These data will be collected via interviews conducted at the midpoint and endpoint of the clinical trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="13985" xml_f="13992" txt_i="7923" txt_f="7930">Methods</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="14012" xml_f="14018" txt_i="7931" txt_f="7937">Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="14029" xml_f="14158" txt_i="7938" txt_f="8067">The study design is a randomized controlled trial of treatment in US public sector mental health outpatient settings (see Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="14188" xml_f="14189" txt_i="8067" txt_f="8068">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14196" xml_f="14939" txt_i="8068" txt_f="8811">).

The randomization lists were generated by ‘R’, an open source statistical program. The treatment condition to which the participant is randomized is not revealed until she arrives at her first treatment session. Thus attrition that occurs between acceptance for treatment and the first session cannot be attributed to treatment assignment. The interval between completion of baseline assessment and first treatment session is expected to be no more than 2 weeks. If circumstances occur such that attendance at first session occurs more than 4 weeks after completion of assessment, the CAPS is re-administered.

The STAIR module focuses on resolving problems in daily living through skills training in emotion management and interpersonal functioning. The first four sessions focus on increasing emotion regulation skills including awareness of feelings, self-soothing exercises, and distress tolerance. The second four sessions focus on development of interpersonal skills and include emotion management in the context of social/interpersonal interactions, exploration and revision of maladaptive interpersonal schemas, effective assertiveness, and increased flexibility in interpersonal expectations and behaviors depending on context. Narrative Therapy is a modified version of prolonged exposure. Two interventions have been added to standard prolonged exposure approaches: (1) ‘grounding’ exercises immediately after exposure, and (2) cognitive reappraisal of the meaning of the trauma, with a focus on interpersonal schemas. Expectations about relationships derived from the trauma narrative are identified and validated, and then contrasted with alternative beliefs or ‘working models’, developed during STAIR that may be more adaptive for current relationships.

In the current study, treatment can range from 16 to 24 sessions. The type and number of sessions are determined by the clinician, whose decisions are guided by the needs of the individual patient. The study protocol allows (a) skipping protocol sessions, (b) repeating sessions, and (c) having non-protocol sessions. There are constraints, such that each of the three components of the treatment has a minimum number of sessions as follows: (1) three sessions of skills training in emotion regulation; (2) four sessions of skills training in interpersonal effectiveness; (3) five sessions of narrative work; and (4) two sessions that bookend the treatment, namely the introduction to treatment and termination sessions. This formula requires that a total of 14 sessions are committed to a particular set of interventions. The clinician can adhere very closely to the minimum requirements and use only two additional sessions to deviate from the protocol (for a total of 16) or can deviate rather substantially with the addition of 10 sessions (for a total of 24).

The benefit of standardizing TAU is that it creates a control condition that is well defined and constant across sites. This reduces the heterogeneity of the outcomes from the TAU condition, thus increasing the power of the tests for the differences between conditions (for a given sample size), and internal validity. However, external validity is limited. That is, the comparison does not allow an assessment of a question of clinical interest and practical import, which is whether SNT is more effective than current practice. Standardized TAU is not necessarily like the treatments used by community providers, but rather is a constructed treatment approximating what therapists actually do in practice. Accordingly, if the results indicated that SNT was more effective than a standardized TAU, the findings might be dismissed by community organizations as having little relevance to their practice. The weakness of a design that uses TAU as it naturally occurs in a clinic, particularly in a multisite study, is that there is likely to be wide variation in TAU from site to site, raising the concern that between-site variability will reduce the power of the study to detect clinically meaningful differences between the treatments.
