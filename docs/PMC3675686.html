This paper describes the qualitative findings of the experience of the intervention and its impact on health and psychosocial outcomes. Twenty four primary care facilities (12 public and private each) were randomized to provide either collaborative stepped care (CSC) or enhanced usual care (EUC) to adults who screen positive for CMDs. Participants were sampled purposively based on two criteria: gender and, in the CSC arm, adherence with the intervention. The qualitative study component involved two semi-structured interviews with participants of both arms (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="4434" xml_f="4435" txt_i="781" txt_f="782">N</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="4444" xml_f="5820" txt_i="782" txt_f="2158"> = 115); the first interview within 2 months of recruitment and the second 6–8 months after recruitment. Data were collected between September 2007 and November 2009. More participants in the CSC than EUC arm reported relief from symptoms and an improvement in social functioning and positive impact on work and activities of daily life. The CSC participants attributed their improvement both to medication received from the doctors and the strategies suggested by the lay Health Counselors (HC). However, two key differences were observed in the results for the two types of facilities. First, the CSC participants in the public sector clinics were more likely to consider the HCs to be an important component of providing care who served as a link between patient and the doctor, provided them skills on stress management and helped in adherence to medication. Second, in the private sector, doctors performed roles similar to those of the HCs and participants in both arms placed much faith in the doctor who acted as a confidante and was perceived to understand the participant's health and context intimately. Lay counselors working in a CSC model have a positive effect on symptomatic relief, social functioning and satisfaction with care in patients with CMD attending primary care clinics although the impact, compared with usual care, is greater in the public sector.</offsets></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title><offsets xml_i="5886" xml_f="5896" txt_i="2170" txt_f="2180">Highlights</offsets></title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label><offsets xml_i="5961" xml_f="5962" txt_i="2181" txt_f="2182">•</offsets></label><p><offsets xml_i="5973" xml_f="6055" txt_i="2182" txt_f="2264">Qualitative evaluation of a lay counselor primary mental health care intervention.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label><offsets xml_i="6100" xml_f="6101" txt_i="2265" txt_f="2266">•</offsets></label><p><offsets xml_i="6112" xml_f="6182" txt_i="2266" txt_f="2336">The intervention led to improved patients' health and social outcomes.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label><offsets xml_i="6227" xml_f="6228" txt_i="2337" txt_f="2338">•</offsets></label><p><offsets xml_i="6239" xml_f="6302" txt_i="2338" txt_f="2401">Improvements were attributed to both counselling and medicines.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label><offsets xml_i="6347" xml_f="6348" txt_i="2402" txt_f="2403">•</offsets></label><p><offsets xml_i="6359" xml_f="6435" txt_i="2403" txt_f="2479">Differences were greater in the public compared with the private facilities.</offsets></p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Qualitative</kwd><kwd>Lay health workers</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title><offsets xml_i="6754" xml_f="6766" txt_i="2488" txt_f="2500">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6777" xml_f="6998" txt_i="2501" txt_f="2722">Depressive or anxiety disorders ('common mental disorders' or CMD) are the leading psychiatric causes of the global burden of disease and the vast majority of patients with these disorders present in primary health care (</offsets><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7032" xml_f="7085" txt_i="2722" txt_f="2771">Marcus, Yasamy, Ommeren, Chisholm, &amp; Saxena, 2012</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7092" xml_f="7230" txt_i="2771" txt_f="2909">).

Notable among these barriers is the lack of skilled and affordable human resources in such settings to deliver the psychosocial interventions and support adherence with medication.

Patients in both arms encountered a new health personnel (the Health Assistant) in the clinic who carried out the screening to detect CMD in addition to their doctor. In the intervention arm, an additional personnel was the Health Counselor (HC), the lay health worker who provided case management and psychosocial interventions. Our primary findings are that when compared with enhanced usual care, more participants in the intervention arm reported relief from symptoms, and an improvement in social functioning in terms of relationships with other family members and significant others and positive impact on work and activities in day-to-day life. The intervention arm participants attributed their improvement to both medication received from the doctors and the strategies suggested by the HCs. Greater number of participants from the intervention arm also reported satisfaction with the overall quality of the care. Contact with the HA was also found to be beneficial by participants in both arms. Participants from control arm were more likely to seek multiple treatment sources and engage in ‘doctor shopping’ due to lesser satisfaction with provision of services and perceived impact of care received. However, some key differences were observed in the results for the private and public facilities.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44362" xml_f="44572" txt_i="36328" txt_f="36538">The quantitative evaluation revealed that the intervention was consistently associated with strong beneficial effects over the 12 months on impact on mental health and disability outcomes in public facilities (</offsets><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="44606" xml_f="44625" txt_i="36538" txt_f="36557">Patel, et al., 2011</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44632" xml_f="46114" txt_i="36557" txt_f="38039">). The results obtained through this qualitative investigation confirm that a collaborative-stepped care intervention delivered by HCs can improve recovery rates for patients with CMDs in public PHC settings. Though two key components of the intervention (provision of screening results to participants and physicians, and evidence-based guidelines to the physician) were offered in both the groups, the qualitative investigation indicate that the differences in the results are due to the instrumental role played by HCs in intervention arm. The intervention arm participants considered the HCs to be an important component of providing care who served as a link between patient and the doctor, provided them skills on stress management and helped in adherence to medication. In the PHCs, larger numbers of patients are seen by the doctor in a shorter period and hence the setting and time constraints limit the ability of the doctor to discuss the interpersonal and social difficulties and issues related to treatment management and adherence. Our findings indicate that this gap was filled by the HCs and to some extent by HAs, with whom participants could discuss range of issues related to illness as well as interpersonal and social difficulties. It is well established that a positive therapeutic relationship in which patients feel free to discuss their problems and work toward their resolution is related to improved outcomes from treatment, particularly in primary care (</offsets><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46147" xml_f="46185" txt_i="38039" txt_f="38073">Anderson, Lindberg, &amp; Troein, 2002</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46192" xml_f="46194" txt_i="38073" txt_f="38075">; </offsets><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46227" xml_f="46237" txt_i="38075" txt_f="38085">Cape, 2000</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46244" xml_f="46380" txt_i="38085" txt_f="38221">).

These health care providers also valued the contribution of HCs who provided a range of psychosocial treatments and emphasized adherence management which widened the scope of health care interventions and enhanced the likelihood of success.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47030" xml_f="47352" txt_i="38824" txt_f="39146">Quantitative findings of the MANAS trial also revealed significant effect modification by type of site, i.e. the recovery rates were not significantly different between the two arms in the private facility phase because the control arm participants had similar recovery rates as those of the intervention in either phase (</offsets><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="47386" xml_f="47404" txt_i="39146" txt_f="39164">Patel et al., 2011</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47411" xml_f="49089" txt_i="39164" txt_f="40842">). In part, our qualitative findings confirm that the greater effectiveness of the private control arm (compared with the control arm of the public facilities) was due to the nature of the therapeutic relationship between patients and doctors. Thus, participants described sharing a long-term and trusting relationship with the doctor. Participants from both arms placed faith in the doctor who also acted as a confidante, was known to the patient for a long period of time, and was perceived to understand the patient's health and context intimately. Unsurprisingly, private sector participants were more likely to report satisfaction with the communication and treatment provided by the doctor. In addition, majority of the beneficiaries, even from the intervention arm, associated improvement to the antidepressants rather than to the HC component of intervention. Thus, it seemed that to a large extent the treatment and care provided by the private doctors approximated the care provided by the HCs. In addition, some participants also reported that interaction with HAs was helpful and therapeutic, and served as a catharsis of their stressors in life; indeed, some participants in the intervention arm confused the roles of the HC with the person carrying out the screening. Although the qualitative investigation observed that greater numbers of participants from the intervention arm than control reported relief from the symptoms, there were fewer differences in improvement in interpersonal relations, work life and perceptions of quality of care. These findings are consistent with those obtained from semi-structured interviews with private GPs of the MANAS trial (</offsets><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="49123" xml_f="49143" txt_i="40842" txt_f="40862">Pereira et al., 2011</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49150" xml_f="50057" txt_i="40862" txt_f="41769">). The interviews with the control arm GPs revealed a number of practices which approximated the program interventions to the extent to which these might well explain their comparable performance. Thus, most GPs routinely diagnosed CMD, and provided psychoeducation, advised on life style changes and problem solving. These GPs also routinely prescribed ADT and referred patients with severe CMD to a psychiatrist. Above all, GPs developed good rapport with patients, offering one-to-one consultations in a private space, maintaining confidentiality, and offering advice which reflected their long-standing relationship with the patient and understanding of the patient's social context. Hence, it appears that there is little advantage in adding a new human resource in the form of a counselor/case manager in private primary care settings, though the addition of screening may be of some additional value.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="50064" xml_f="51371" txt_i="41770" txt_f="43077">Although there are now several trials conducted on collaborative stepped care approach to manage depression in the primary care settings in the high and middle income countries, to the best of our knowledge, MANAS is the first trial evaluating the impact of the intervention through concurrent quantitative and qualitative investigation. In conclusion, results from this qualitative investigation indicate the effectiveness of a lay health counselor-led collaborative stepped-care intervention for CMDs in public PHCs on a range of outcomes including symptomatic relief, social functioning and satisfaction with care. The intervention used in the current study may provide a model of how a trained lay counselor can assist the busy public sector primary care physician in educating patients, monitoring and reinforcing adherence, and helping patients with behavioral and lifestyle changes that may be beneficial to their clinical outcome. In the private sector, training GP's in detection, treatment and care of common mental disorders may be sufficient to achieve comparable outcomes. Policy makers concerned with public health care should consider including lay health workers as a key human resource for delivering collaborative care for CMDs in resource constrained, busy public primary care facilities.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindberg</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Troein</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>What shapes GPs' work with depressed patients?
