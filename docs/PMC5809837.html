To tackle this problem more effectively, practicing innovative ways of health care service delivery, which will be integrated with the existing health care system is crucial, and thus mobile technology is being used. Despite the widespread use of mobile technologies in the health care system, there is limited evidence on the efficacy of mobile-phone-based interventions, or m-health, on maternal health care service utilization. In Ethiopia, no study has been conducted on the topic. To fill the gap, this study, through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), examines the effects of m-health on maternal health care service use in Eastern Ethiopia. It is hypothesized that m-health will increase maternal health care service provision in limited-resource and -literacy settings. In this RCT, two districts that are 34 km apart will be selected to reduce the possible risk of contamination between the intervention and control arms and to evaluate the barriers of implementation. The outcomes of this investigation will be analyzed for both intervention and control arms separately. Examining challenges and outcomes at this stage will provide insight into m-health implementation for improved maternal health care service use.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title><offsets xml_i="14528" xml_f="14542" txt_i="6335" txt_f="6349">Methods/design</offsets></title><sec id="Sec3"><title><offsets xml_i="14572" xml_f="14584" txt_i="6350" txt_f="6362">Study design</offsets></title><p id="Par44"><offsets xml_i="14606" xml_f="15038" txt_i="6363" txt_f="6795">A single-blind, cluster-RCT study design will be employed on districts and their respective health centers (HCs).

It is also recognized that m-health is a dynamic issue with the fast transfer in both technology and information literacy for developing countries. Hence, there is a need to examine what works or does not work yet and to establish a standard in this area.
