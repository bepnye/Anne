In the context of a multi-center trial, each clinical center's rate will need to be estimated. One approach for evaluating each clinical center is to solicit information via a questionnaire. Content of the questionnaire could include measurements of the total number of cases currently or recently seen for the targeted condition, a listing of other clinical trials that might compete for the same patients, and a summary of the investigator's (or clinical center's) experience meeting prior accrual expectations. The completed questionnaires can be used to formulate an initial estimate of the accrual rate for each participating clinical center.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5938" xml_f="6089" txt_i="2563" txt_f="2714">However, experience has shown the accrual period is longer than planned even when such tangible efforts are made to estimate the accrual rate.

Often, the expected rate for the clinical trial is estimated by summing the historical trends at each participating research site to create a study-wide estimate of the accrual rate. For example, if subjects are to be recruited from 5 sites at the expected rate of 5 participants per month per site, then one could estimate that it would take 8 months to enroll 200 participants using the combined rate of 25 participants per month. However, since the rate of 25 participants per month is assumed to be fixed in value, it is best to consider that "on average" it may take 8 months to enroll 200 participants. The obvious limitation of this approach is that there is no mechanism to account for known sources of variation in the rate. For example, if the 5 sites were to begin enrolling at different times, then a study-wide estimate of 25 participants per month is no longer tenable. The following approach directly addresses this limitation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7785" xml_f="7802" txt_i="4284" txt_f="4301">Conditional rates</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7813" xml_f="8567" txt_i="4302" txt_f="5056">A more accurate estimate of the accrual period is possible when additional prior information is incorporated into the model. Two important sources of variation in the overall accrual period are the rates at which individual sites accrue and the length of time in which sites actively recruit participants. For example, suppose that a large research institution (Site A) may be capable of recruiting 15 participants per month and that four additional sites are only capable of recruiting a combined 10 participants per month. Then, the point in time in which the Site A begins enrollment will greatly affect the trial's overall accrual rate. Moreover, the timing of Site A's initiation and subsequent accrual should be critically evaluated by the sponsor.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8574" xml_f="9288" txt_i="5057" txt_f="5771">For example, if it is known in advance that Site A will take 4 to 8 weeks longer to initiate recruitment than the other four sites, an estimate of 8 months to enroll 200 participants would seem overly optimistic. The sponsor might be interested in determining the effect of including Site A on key trial markers (e.g., feasibility, cost, and total clinical trial duration) by allowing for up to an 8-week delay in Site A's initiation. However, the calculation of a more refined accrual period, which would drive many of the cost estimates, would require the adjustment for time dependent changes in the overall accrual rate. Fortunately, computational tools such as a spreadsheet aid in the necessary calculations.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9310" xml_f="9325" txt_i="5773" txt_f="5788">Poisson process</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9336" xml_f="9373" txt_i="5789" txt_f="5826">The methodology presented by Carter [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="9404" xml_f="9405" txt_i="5826" txt_f="5827">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9412" xml_f="10019" txt_i="5827" txt_f="6434">] allows for a more sophisticated model that can incorporate a variety of sources of variations. In this paper, the exploration of mean accrual time will be examined. As the two previous approaches illustrate, the mean number of participants per month per site was assumed to be fixed, yet the overall accrual time varied. The source of variation introduced was a delay in the initiation of the protocol at a site. There is another source of variation. Just as is well established in economics, historical trends may not adequately reflect future trends especially when short periods of time are considered.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10026" xml_f="10217" txt_i="6435" txt_f="6626">One approach to incorporating variation into mean number of participants per month is to assume that participants arrive into the study according to a known probability distribution.

Essentially, this method simulates the accrual into a trial using a random number generator. At the end of each simulation iteration, the number of days (or months) required for the program to reach the sample size is recorded. When the simulations are repeated many times, an empirical distribution of the accrual period is obtained. Using this empirical distribution, one can answer questions related to the probability of completing accrual within a specified time as well as observe how much variance in accrual time can be expected given the model assumptions. This probabilistic approach is most beneficial when a finite amount of time has been granted for the clinical trial. Thus by conditioning on the predetermined time, one could estimate the number of clinical centers and the rate per month needed to ensure with high probability, such as 80%, that the clinical trial will complete enrollment before the allocated time expires.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11466" xml_f="11473" txt_i="7736" txt_f="7743">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11484" xml_f="12071" txt_i="7744" txt_f="8331">To illustrate these three approaches, a multi-center protocol undergoing development is presented.

The estimate of 23 months seems much more reasonable given the staggered initiation process; however, additional models could be implemented to examine the effects of fluctuations in the accrual rates. Two separate Poisson models are presented in Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="15826" xml_f="15827" txt_i="10788" txt_f="10789">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15834" xml_f="16876" txt_i="10789" txt_f="11831">. Both models use the initiation pattern of the conditional model; however, the daily rate, which is the monthly rate divided by the standard number of days in the month, has been adjusted to reflect anticipated enrollment dynamics. Specifically, while the clinical sites treat potential participants every day of the week, research staff are expected to be available only five days per week. Thus, the estimated rate per month is discounted effectively by 5/7 to reflect this anticipated pattern. The second Poisson model further adjusts the estimate of 2 participants per month downward to be uniformly distributed between zero and two. Such an adjustment might be necessary to account for the difference in the number of participants eligible for the trial and the number that will actually consent to participate in the research. In addition, this reduction in the overall rate also adjusts the rate downward for other competing demands that could affect the participant accrual rate but would be difficult to quantify directly.

As our example illustrates, the unconditional approach, while simple to implement, can yield results not consistent with trial assumptions, and may endanger the successful completion of the trial. It is acknowledged that the most complicated aspect pertaining to the estimation of accrual periods is the determination of the expected rate. As our example illustrates, sometimes dramatically different results occur with what are apparently minor modifications to model assumptions. When the potential impact of a poorly accruing clinical trial is considered, spending additional time examining the effects of model assumptions is well justified. In the end, accounting for variation and planning are essential components of good clinical research.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18454" xml_f="19368" txt_i="13209" txt_f="14123">For the research study under consideration in this example, an estimate of 24 months to complete study recruitment seems reasonable. An accrual rate of at least two participants per month is the minimum requirement, so the expected rate after adjustment for screening to enrollment dropout percentages should still yield an accrual rate of approximately two per month. However, a more refined estimate of the accrual period can be obtained once final selection of the research sites has been made and all historical information has been analyzed. These models can also be applied after study enrollment has begun, and in the case of the Poisson model, estimating the probability of meeting the established accrual deadline has several practical implications. Although the methods have been presented in the context of a multi-center clinical trial, they are valid in the planning of a single-center clinical trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19375" xml_f="19581" txt_i="14124" txt_f="14330">To facilitate implementation of the models in practice, a spreadsheet template for the calculation of the conditional model and SAS programs for the Poisson process are posted on the first author's website </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://people.musc.edu/~carterre/manuscripts"></ext-link><offsets xml_i="19680" xml_f="20027" txt_i="14330" txt_f="14677">.

For most multi-center clinical trials, the conditional approach should be implemented. Simulation studies using the Poisson model are recommended if there is uncertainty in the accrual rate or if the accrual rate is expected to change over time.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20715" xml_f="20734" txt_i="15277" txt_f="15296">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20745" xml_f="20805" txt_i="15297" txt_f="15357">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20827" xml_f="20849" txt_i="15359" txt_f="15381">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20860" xml_f="21131" txt_i="15382" txt_f="15653">RC conceptualized the three accrual models and performed the analyses.
