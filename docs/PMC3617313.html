This study was also performed to select the proper dose of tetanus toxoid in the new Td vaccines. Healthy adolescents aged between 11 and 12 yr participated in this study. A total of 130 subjects (44 GC1107-T5.0, 42 GC1107-T7.5 and 44 control vaccine) completed a single dose of vaccination. Blood samples were collected from the subjects before and 4 weeks after the vaccination. In this study, all subjects (100%) in both GC1107-T5.0 and GC1107-T7.5 groups showed seroprotective antibody levels (≥ 0.1 U/mL) against diphtheria or tetanus toxoids. After the vaccination, the geometric mean titer (GMT) against diphtheria was significantly higher in Group GC1107-T5.0 (6.53) and GC1107-T7.5 (6.11) than in the control group (3.96). The GMT against tetanus was 18.6 in Group GC1107-T5.0, 19.94 in GC1107-T7.5 and 19.01 in the control group after the vaccination. In this study, the rates of local adverse reactions were 67.3% and 59.1% in GC1107-T5.0 and GC1107-7.5, respectively. No significant differences in the number of adverse reactions, prevalence and degree of severity of the solicited and unsolicited adverse reactions were observed among the three groups. Thus, both newly developed Td vaccines appear to be safe and show good immunogenicity. GC1107-T5.0, which contains relatively small amounts of tetanus toxoid, has been selected for a phase III clinical trial.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tetanus-Reduced Diphtheria (Td) Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6745" xml_f="6757" txt_i="1589" txt_f="1601">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6768" xml_f="6829" txt_i="1602" txt_f="1663">Diphtheria is a toxin-mediated respiratory disease caused by </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="6837" xml_f="6864" txt_i="1663" txt_f="1690">Corynebacterium diphtheriae</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="6873" xml_f="6967" txt_i="1690" txt_f="1784"> with a high mortality rate and a range of symptoms through a systemic blood-borne infection (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="6998" xml_f="6999" txt_i="1784" txt_f="1785">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7006" xml_f="7067" txt_i="1785" txt_f="1846">).

The Td vaccine (GC1107-T7.5) used in the phase I clinical trial contained 7.5 Lf (flocculation units) of tetanus toxoid, which is higher than the 5 Lf tetanus toxoid contained in the Td vaccine distributed worldwide. The recent outbreak of pertussis has led to the recommendation of combined Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis (Tdap) vaccinations to adolescents and adults in epidemic areas with a minimum 5-yr vaccination interval. In this situation, the high rate of adverse reactions of Td vaccination may create a great deal of concern due to this short interval of vaccination.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9099" xml_f="9435" txt_i="3649" txt_f="3985">The objective of this study was to compare the immunogenicity and safety of a newly developed Td vaccine (GC1107-T5.0 and GC1107-T7.5) and control vaccine (Td pure®, SK Chemical, Seongnam, Korea).
