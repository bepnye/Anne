Information about the beliefs and attitudes toward sex during pregnancy, in addition to identifying the improper sexual beliefs of women, can help health care workers in correcting misconceptions by counseling pregnant women.

The determined educational content was offered during five sessions of 1–1.5 hours during a 2-week period at the already coordinated times when the women visited the health centers. The meetings included lectures using PowerPoint presentations, movies and photos, and question &amp; answer. Among the most important topics discussed were a short review of the anatomy and physiology of male and female reproductive organs, their changes during pregnancy, mental changes at different stages of pregnancy, the sexual response cycle of males and females, changes of sexual response cycle during pregnancy, recall of common sexual misconceptions and challenging them through group discussion, determining attitudes toward sexual activity during pregnancy, a review of sexual disorders especially during pregnancy, providing facts on the importance of satisfying sexual needs, the role of sexual relations in the context of the overall relationship and the dimensions of quality of the marital relationship, and presenting appropriate and safe positions for sexual activity during pregnancy.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19121" xml_f="20428" txt_i="12878" txt_f="14185">After obtaining ethical permission from the Regional Ethical Review Board of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences (approval number: IR.ZAUMS.REC.1394.89) to conduct this study, the health centers were randomly selected from among the five regions of the city.

The selected women were randomly assigned into two groups – intervention and control. At first, the questionnaires were completed by both groups (pretest). Then, in the intervention group, the required coordination for holding group sexual counseling sessions was performed. After reaching an adequate number of subjects, the intervention was conducted in the form of groups of five to ten people by the researcher. Again, 6 weeks after the last session of group sexual consultation, the questionnaires were completed by both groups (posttest). The control group received no intervention, just routine prenatal care. Obtaining written informed consent, confidentiality of personal and sexual information, describing the objectives of the study, and describing the research method were the most important ethical considerations in this study.
