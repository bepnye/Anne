Since cocaine is illicit and is a relatively well-publicized teratogen, participants may be more likely to impose harsher maternal sanctions in situations involving prenatal exposure to cocaine, than legal drugs also associated with low birth weight and stillbirths. In Study 1 we hypothesized that attitudes toward substance-using pregnant mothers and postnatal outcomes attributable to prenatal cocaine exposure would be more negative than for licit substances. Study 1 examined college student participants' attitudes about criminal sanctions for hypothetical scenarios involving pregnant women's use of one of four substances; cocaine, nicotine, alcohol and caffeine.

Since all of the mothers in their sample had continued in drug treatment program, Lester and Tronick speculated that this intervention could have mitigated prenatal exposure to crack cocaine and other substances. They emphasized that when infants who were exposed to a wide variety of potentially harmful prenatal insults develop in a reasonably sound home environment, they should be expected to do almost as well as any infant. In contrast, a hostile postnatal environment can aggravate earlier negative prenatal influences and jeopardize the potential for normal patterns of growth and development. They further suggested that responsive postnatal environments noted in their investigation were not considered in past research and may have been one reason that previous investigators had failed to find significant outcome differences in a previous three-year follow-up of their neonatal sample [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"><offsets xml_i="20629" xml_f="20631" txt_i="15395" txt_f="15397">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20638" xml_f="20640" txt_i="15397" txt_f="15399">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20647" xml_f="21945" txt_i="15400" txt_f="16698">The findings of Study 1 showed that the sample held different attitudes about possible criminal sanctions and developmental problems for cocaine, compared to attitudes about alcohol, nicotine and caffeine. Results from Study 2 showed that stereotyped attitudes were modified, at least in the short-term, by media portrayals. However, the cognitive dissonance effect observed in the positive media condition raises doubts about whether these relatively more positive attitudes observed in the short-term would persist. Our findings did not address long-term attitude changes, or whether the data may generalize to a broader population sample. Finding mechanisms for reducing popular crack baby stigmas in the long-term may essentially influence future policy decisions by legislators. Establishing more sensible, equitable measures to treat cocaine-addicted mothers and their children is essential for improving U.S. drug policy. Favorable post-natal environments have moderated potential deleterious prenatal effects, a hopeful finding that should be emphasized in the continuing policy dialogues and media characterizations about cocaine's harmful effects and the treatment of affected women and children. Reducing popular crack baby stigmas could influence future policy decisions by legislators.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="21986" xml_f="21993" txt_i="16700" txt_f="16707">Methods</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22013" xml_f="22108" txt_i="16708" txt_f="16803">Study 1: Comparing attitudes about prenatal exposure to cocaine, alcohol, nicotine and caffeine</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22119" xml_f="22403" txt_i="16804" txt_f="17088">We compared 336 university students' evaluations of criminal justice sanctions against mothers who potentially harmed their fetuses through prenatal ingestion of one of four substances associated with low birth weight and possible stillbirths: cocaine, alcohol, nicotine and caffeine.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22410" xml_f="22730" txt_i="17089" txt_f="17409">The participants were 336 undergraduate students enrolled in Introduction to Psychology (M = 19.8 years, SD = 4.52).
