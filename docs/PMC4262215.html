Notably, the application of a mental clinical nursing pathway in our present study could regulate malignant tumor patients’ nursing care, identify suicide risks as soon as possible, implement timely intervention measures, improve the degree of suicidal ideation in patients, and reduce the suicide rate in hospitalized patients with malignant tumors. Importantly, the result of the Spearman’s correlation analysis suggests that the patients’ suicidal ideation was negatively correlated with KPS. The results of KPS showed that the application of a mental clinical nursing pathway could reduce patients’ suicidal ideation and significantly improve the patients’ quality of life as well as the medical treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17629" xml_f="18241" txt_i="12407" txt_f="13019">As we know, the idea of a mental clinical nursing pathway in clinical work has not yet been universal, and psychological changes during different periods in patients with tumors are larger. Therefore, a mental clinical nursing pathway still needs to be constantly adjusted and revised to improve the practicality and normativity of psychological intervention. In addition, suicide is the result of multiple factors’ interaction. Evidence in other literature suggests that depression and anxiety, and advanced tumor pain and dysfunction, are the two main causes of cancer patients’ suicide or suicidal tendencies.</offsets><xref rid="b15-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18284" xml_f="18286" txt_i="13019" txt_f="13021">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18293" xml_f="18819" txt_i="13021" txt_f="13547"> Additionally, if a patient has a comorbid psychiatric disorder, it may be difficult to find a medication that addresses both the psychiatric disorder and suicidal ideation. Thus, it is very important for medical workers to treat the primary disease, especially pain control and recovery of function in patients with malignant tumors. In particular, additional drug therapy is necessary for those patients with severe mental disorders, and suicide crisis intervention should also be adopted to reduce the incidence of suicide.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was financially supported by Key Department of Jiangsu Medicine (2012–12).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ppa-8-1665"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>World Health Organization, Department of Chronic Diseases and Health Promotion</collab></person-group><source>National cancer control programs: policies and managerial guidelines</source><edition>2nd edition</edition><publisher-name>Health and Development Networks</publisher-name><year>2002</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-ppa-8-1665"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsukuma</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Masaoka</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>Suicide risk among cancer patients: experience at one medical center in Japan, 1978–1994</article-title><source>Jpn J Cancer Res</source><year>1999</year><volume>90</volume><issue>8</issue><fpage>812</fpage><lpage>817</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10543251</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-ppa-8-1665"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akechi</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Okuyama</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Sugawara</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakano</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Shima</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Uchitomi</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Suicidality in terminally ill Japanese patients with cancer</article-title><source>Cancer</source><year>2004</year><volume>100</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>183</fpage><lpage>191</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14692039</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-ppa-8-1665"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Editorial Board of Chinese Behavioral Medicine</collab></person-group><source>Behavioral medicine inventory manual</source><publisher-loc>Beijing</publisher-loc><publisher-name>The Chinese Medicine Electronic Audio and Video Publishing House</publisher-name><year>2005</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-ppa-8-1665"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mor</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Laliberte</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiemann</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Karnofsky Performance Status Scale.
