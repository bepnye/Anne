After exclusion of more sinister causes of haemorrhoidal symptoms (rectal bleeding, perianal irritation and prolapse), the best option for treatment depends upon persistence and severity of the symptoms. Minor symptoms often respond to conservative treatment such as dietary fibre and reassurance. For more severe symptoms treatment such as rubber band ligation may be therapeutic and is a very commonly performed procedure in the surgical outpatient setting. Surgery is usually reserved for those who have more severe symptoms, as well as those who do not respond to non-operative therapy; surgical techniques include haemorrhoidectomy and haemorrhoidopexy.

A rubber band is then fired onto the base of the haemorrhoid which constricts the blood supply causing it to become ischaemic before being sloughed approximately 1–2 weeks later. The resultant fibrosis reduces any element of haemorrhoidal prolapse that may have been present. This is a very commonly performed procedure in all SOPCs; figures from an audit of current practice at STH over 20 such procedures are carried out every week. The procedure is a basic surgical skill that all senior staff are familiar with and competent in performing.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19847" xml_f="20301" txt_i="13993" txt_f="14447">HAL uses a proctoscope modified to incorporate a Doppler transducer.

Further detailed analysis of haemorrhoid recurrence will be performed by analysing the length of time to recurrence under a Cox-proportional hazards model adjusting for the same covariates. The secondary outcome of pain, as measured on the visual analogue scale (VAS), with repeated measures will be analysed under a multi-level longitudinal approach adjusting for the same covariates. The secondary outcome of procedural complications elicited during the complications review or from the patient notes at 6 weeks and one year post surgery, will be compared between the two groups at each time point using Poisson regression which accounts for the essentially random nature with which complications arise, although care will be taken to note whether there is any clustering by surgeon.

These explorations may prove valuable to future modelling studies in this area as there is evidence that previous studies have been hampered by limited utility data. Indeed, a specific recommendation of a recent HTA study was “that further research should include RCTs which collect a generic HRQoL measure such as the EQ-5D or SF-36 at follow-up times close to the procedure and, in the long term, calculate an estimate of preference-based utility. Baseline data from a trial of this kind would also provide a better estimate of HRQoL and utility of patients with symptoms.” (p.88 HTA report
