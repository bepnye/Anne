In this study, target nail clearing and new nail growth provided a clinical basis for estimating the MCID for each scale, as well as for generating an overall MCID for the PRO questionnaire.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36220" xml_f="36569" txt_i="25735" txt_f="26084">In the estimation of the MCID, the choice of a clinical measure is important, because a measure that captures too large a change in a patient's clinical status can obscure the PRO score's ability to reflect small but measurable changes in status. In this study, two measures of incremental improvement, based on target nail clearing, were evaluated.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36576" xml_f="37292" txt_i="26085" txt_f="26801">Results for the smaller level of clinical change (12.5%) corresponded to the smallest average amount of change in the PRO scales (7.30); however, because the clinical differences were probably less discernible to patients (corresponding to one-eighth of a patient's target nail), not all of the adjacent comparisons were statistically significant and therefore not all differences were included in the estimation of the MCID. Estimation using 25% difference in nail clearing was based on statistically significant differences between all adjacent increments of clinical change. Nevertheless, results under both scenarios were consistent with respect to all scores except Symptom Frequency and Treatment Satisfaction.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37299" xml_f="38283" txt_i="26802" txt_f="27786">In addition, a Clinical Success measure involving only two categories (Success or Failure, based on new nail growth of 5 mm or more) was used to estimate the MCID. Clinical Success encompassed a large amount of clinical improvement, and corresponded to a much larger MCID than percent clearing (The MCID for Clinical Success was 16.63, almost twice as large as the MCID for a 25% difference in nail clearing). The MCID is a way to quantify how sensitive a measure is to clinical change (i.e., how much does a scale need to change to correspond to a change in clinical status). For instance, based all three estimation methods, Stigma and Symptom Bothersomeness were the most sensitive measures: a 5- to 6-point gain in the scale corresponded to an incremental improvement in nail clearing (based on either 12.5% or 25% nail clearing improvement). Conversely, the Overall Problem measure reflected clinical change only after a gain of over 11 points, indicating a less sensitive scale.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38290" xml_f="38924" txt_i="27787" txt_f="28421">In the absence of a clinical measure, the Minimally Important Difference (MID) can be estimated as some proportion of the standard deviation; a reasonable MID might represent one-quarter to one-third of a standard deviation for the score in question. In the context of baseline PRO scores, which had standard deviations of approximately 22 to 33 points, the overall MCID estimates for nail clearing represented amounts of change that generally fell into that range. The MCID for new nail growth fell outside that range – a MCID of 16.63 points represented one-half to three-quarters of a standard deviation of the baseline PRO scores.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38931" xml_f="39272" txt_i="28422" txt_f="28763">The MCID can help interpret PRO results for the treating provider by translating an objectively understood clinical assessment, such as the percent of nail clearing, into a number of points on a PRO scale. For a clinician, this means that an average gain of about 8 to 9 points in PRO can be expected with a 25% improvement in nail clearing.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39279" xml_f="39736" txt_i="28764" txt_f="29221">Future studies of the responsiveness and clinical meaningfulness of the OnyCOE-t™ questionnaire could address the limitations of the population. Administering this questionnaire to groups of patients expected to have different clinical outcomes (e.g., active versus placebo studies) might allow for sharper distinctions between Improved and Not Improved groups, and for a larger Stable group.
