During an EUS procedure, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) scope is inserted into the esophagus through the mouth to obtain ultrasonographic as well as endoluminal images of various upper gastrointestinal pathologies. The probe has a channel that enables ultrasoundguided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of suspicious lesions to be performed at the same time. The distal end of the EUS probe has a longer, stiffer section than conventional endoscopes and therefore needs extra care during manipulation through the gastrointestinal tract. Further, the diameter of the EUS probe is greater than that of conventional endoscopes, at around 13–14 mm compared to 8–10 mm. The procedure usually takes between 30 min and 1 h. Patients are sedated to keep them comfortable during the procedure and to help them tolerate the scope.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6780" xml_f="6947" txt_i="2576" txt_f="2743">Propofol is a common sedative agent for outpatient procedures because of its advantageous pharmacokinetic properties, which include a quick and clear-headed recovery [</offsets><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6978" xml_f="6979" txt_i="2743" txt_f="2744">1</offsets></xref><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7017" xml_f="7018" txt_i="2744" txt_f="2745">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7025" xml_f="7282" txt_i="2745" txt_f="3002">].

Side effects include increased secretions and agitation on recovery. To counter the side effects, we administered glycopyrrolate in the ketamine group along with midazolam as premedication. Increased salivation can be problematic especially during upper GI endoscopic procedures in which the patient is unable to swallow due to the presence of the scope. Midazolam was administered to prevent agitation during recovery from ketamine [</offsets><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18671" xml_f="18673" txt_i="13268" txt_f="13270">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18680" xml_f="18682" txt_i="13270" txt_f="13272">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18689" xml_f="18703" txt_i="13273" txt_f="13287">Singh et al.

Hence, we evaluated whether the addition of ketamine or fentanyl in a small single dose to propofol infusion for sedation during EUS resulted in a decrease in propofol consumption. In line with previous studies, in the present study, we found that the addition of either 50 µg of fentanyl or 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of propofol consumed (in mg/kg/h). There was no difference in the dose of propofol used between the ketamine and fentanyl groups. Time taken to achieve PADS was significantly longer in the ketamine group; however, all patients were successfully discharged from the recovery room at the end of a 2-h observation period. There were no major adverse events in any of the three groups. This is in accordance with previous studies in which the use of either propofol with ketamine or propofol with fentanyl for deep sedation had comparable side effects with minor hemodynamic events [</offsets><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="20943" xml_f="20945" txt_i="15295" txt_f="15297">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20952" xml_f="20954" txt_i="15297" txt_f="15299">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20961" xml_f="21335" txt_i="15300" txt_f="15674">Thus, we can conclude from the present study that the addition of fentanyl to propofol results in a decrease in propofol consumption with no increase in either the time to recovery or adverse effects. Fentanyl is thus a good additive to propofol for sedation during EUS. The addition of a single dose of ketamine reduced the total propofol requirement, but delayed recovery.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation
