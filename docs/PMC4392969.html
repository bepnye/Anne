The body empowerment approach posits that increased knowledge, sense of ownership, and pride in the body (“body knowledge”) are an independent pathway to self-esteem and to self-efficacy for protection behavior—use of female-initiated barriers, MC negotiation with partners, and refusal of unsafe sex.

We also focused on the need for female solidarity and mutual support.

We integrated content on female and male barriers in each intervention session, focusing on practical applications of the FC with diverse partners, including paid sexual transactions (e.g., “cheeking” or oral application of MC without partner initiation) concomitant with drug use (e.g., inserting an FC before getting high), and situations of potentially violent partners (inserting cervical barrier with spermicide for discreet risk reduction).

Study participants were selected on the basis of specific criteria drawn up to concentrate a high level of drug-related and sexual risk. They agreed and were expected to attend five, relatively long, intervention sessions and return for follow-up assessments. Other drug-using populations with a lower risk profile or less availability for study procedures might have demonstrated different results. All self-reported behavior is subject to social desirability bias. Nevertheless, we used a-CASI [</offsets><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34080" xml_f="34082" txt_i="26662" txt_f="26664">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34089" xml_f="34884" txt_i="26664" txt_f="27459">], an established technique to increase the validity of reporting of sensitive behavior in numerous populations. Additionally, there was high variability in frequency of reported unprotected acts at both time points. These considerations tend to mitigate concerns about reporting bias, though there is no way of eliminating this possibility. Comparisons of FC and MC use proportions were cross-sectional due to high levels of changes in partner and sexual activity. The last data were collected in 2004, potentially raising concerns about relevance. Drug-using women continue to be at extremely high risk for HIV/STI, with large demonstrated racial disparities, despite successful inroads made for other at-risk populations in the interim, such as non-injection-using men who have sex with men [</offsets><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34916" xml_f="34918" txt_i="27459" txt_f="27461">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34925" xml_f="34977" txt_i="27461" txt_f="27513">]; additional approaches are still urgently needed [</offsets><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="35009" xml_f="35011" txt_i="27513" txt_f="27515">35</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35018" xml_f="35339" txt_i="27515" txt_f="27836">].

We did not find it ethical to withhold FC from control participants. Also, our analysis was based on an intention-to-treat approach; women assigned to the intervention arm did not necessarily complete all five sessions. The sample size may have been too small to detect some changes that were statistically significant—for example, the differences within main partner across intervention and control arms. Finally, contamination of the message across study arms was certainly possible, given the relatively small geographic recruitment area and overlapping social networks; this too would have acted to minimize observed differences across the study arms.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title><offsets xml_i="36176" xml_f="36189" txt_i="28632" txt_f="28645">5.
