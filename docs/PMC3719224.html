By asking the key question “Have you ever thought about HIV/AIDS?” at the beginning of the first session, the students were asked to think about AIDS. Then, they were taught about HIV/AIDS epidemiology, its global statistics, and ways of identifying the disease, using audiovisual equipments.

The students in groups of four to five persons discussed the task. At the end of the group discussion, representatives of each group presented the achieved results to the rest of the students, and then the researcher explained the vague points and answered the students’ questions. Also, the ways of transmission and disease cycle were presented and their misconceptions were corrected. For instance, there were some misconceptions like “anal sex does not lead to HIV/AIDS,” “by having sex once, a person will not be infected,” or “only pervert people become infected”; therefore, some explanations were given.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17813" xml_f="18524" txt_i="11954" txt_f="12665">Furthermore, in the second session, through the prevention ways, the students were asked to talk about their feelings toward sexual abstinence. For providing the students with clear and more precise prevention techniques, extracts from the Holy Quran verses and religious literature were used, which brought about a kind of religious support. Also, the address of the behavior consulting center and its services was presented. During the third session, discussion about perceived susceptibility and perceived risk was offered and it was also discussed that women and girls are more vulnerable to the infection.

The scenario was about a girl student who suggests her friend to go to a party, but she refuses with decisive answers. Afterward, the participants were asked to write a short story about a girl who was experiencing a high-risk situation, and to analyze how she could avoid such situation. This task provides them with replacement experience. At the end, a multimedia educational package (CD) and a book with the name “Healthy Life” were distributed among the participants.
