The home-based, wellness coaching intervention period will last for 12 weeks, with laboratory assessments at baseline, post-intervention (3 months after baseline), and at follow-up (6 months after baseline). A 6-month follow-up period was chosen to evaluate the feasibility of having participants return to the laboratory for an assessment following the conclusion of the intervention. A fully powered study examining the impact on health outcomes may employ a longer-term follow-up to assess maintenance of behavior change and subsequent changes in health outcomes.</offsets><fig id="Fig1"><label><offsets xml_i="18965" xml_f="18971" txt_i="12829" txt_f="12835">Fig. 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="18991" xml_f="19049" txt_i="12835" txt_f="12893">Study flow diagram for The Wildcat Wellness Coaching Trial</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40814_2016_66_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"></graphic></fig><offsets xml_i="19134" xml_f="19135" txt_i="12894" txt_f="12895">

Since this is a new combination of a one-on-one wellness coaching intervention delivered within the home setting to girls, there is no current literature available regarding effect sizes needed for future power calculations. As such, we will assess the preliminary impact on health-related outcomes to more appropriately inform a future fully powered trial. Using a 6-month follow-up assessment will allow us to evaluate the feasibility of having participants return to the laboratory following a no-contact period, as well as the potential for lasting impacts resulting from the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41040" xml_f="41821" txt_i="33347" txt_f="34128">An additional consideration when developing an intervention with multiple outcome measures is participant burden. The inclusion of the health outcome measures has been a very successful recruitment tool in the past, since parents will be provided with a results packet at the conclusion of the intervention. We are able to provide health information for their children at no cost. In our experience, participants have viewed the battery of health assessments (lasting around 1 h) as a benefit, rather than a burden. Additionally, participants are also receiving a free wellness coach in their home for 12 weeks. For the families who have completed the intervention, we have qualitative data from parents and girls expressing that the overall process has been a positive experience.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41828" xml_f="42464" txt_i="34129" txt_f="34765">The proposed home-based wellness coaching model, consisting of both the health education and healthy eating and physical activity skills conditions, may serve as a novel approach to overcome difficulties of reaching this specific population for early health promotion and obesity prevention intervention. Such early intervention is needed, due to the high prevalence of overweight and obesity and the associated costs, both physical and financial. Additionally, the National Prevention Strategy is codified within the Affordable Care Act and seeks to integrate effective prevention strategies to promote improved health and well-being [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39"><offsets xml_i="42497" xml_f="42499" txt_i="34765" txt_f="34767">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42506" xml_f="42926" txt_i="34767" txt_f="35187">]. As such, there is now a much better platform for prevention within the USA, and obesity prevention through home-based wellness coaching may align well with those national efforts. Creating sustainable behavior change through wellness coaching may play a key role in reducing the burden of childhood obesity. If feasible, the model will be further evaluated in a fully powered randomized controlled trial study design.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p>
