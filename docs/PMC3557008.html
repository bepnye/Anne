Controlling these changes is one of the most important issues in open heart surgery. It requires monitoring BP, PR, heart rhythm, and CVP.

For example, having vasoplegic syndrome causes hard vasodilatation after CPB. Vasoconstriction, which is the opposite of vasodilatation, is particularly important in stopping hemorrhage and acute blood loss. Vasoconstrictors or vasopressors are substances used in vasoconstriction.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ARYA-08-161"><offsets xml_i="10488" xml_f="10489" txt_i="6352" txt_f="6353">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10496" xml_f="10922" txt_i="6353" txt_f="6779"> When blood vessels constrict, the flow of blood is limited or reduced. Therefore, body heat is maintained and vascular resistance is increased. The second reason might be inordinate temperature of the patient during rewarming under CPB. This process may reduce vasodilatation which in turn decreases blood circulation and BP.
