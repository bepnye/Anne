Diagnostic uncertainty and patient expectations and worries are major drivers of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. A C-reactive protein (CRP) point of care test may help GPs to better guide antibiotic treatment by ruling out pneumonia in cases of low test results. Alternatively, enhanced communication skills training to help clinicians address patients' expectations and worries could lead to a decrease in antibiotic prescribing, without compromising clinical recovery, while enhancing patient enablement. The aim of this paper is to describe the design and methods of a study to assess two interventions for improving LRTI management in general practice.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5179" xml_f="5193" txt_i="814" txt_f="828">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5204" xml_f="5796" txt_i="829" txt_f="1421">This cluster randomised controlled, factorial trial will introduce two interventions in general practice; point of care CRP testing and enhanced communication skills training for LRTI.

CRP trapped on the membrane will bind the antibody gold conjugate. Unbound conjugate is removed by one drop of washing solution.

If there is no indication of random effects at a GP level, then this will be reduced to a two level model with GP seen acting as a patient level covariate.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35050" xml_f="35538" txt_i="27061" txt_f="27549">A four level linear regression model will be fitted to the symptom scores (logged) to account for practice, GP, patient and repeated assessments over time. The correlation between repeated assessments within individual patients will be modelled to allow for greater correlation between assessments, which are closer in time. The effect of interventions would be seen in the comparison of the slopes of symptom scores over time in the groups, i.e. having faster (or slower) recovery rates[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"><offsets xml_i="35570" xml_f="35572" txt_i="27549" txt_f="27551">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35579" xml_f="35957" txt_i="27551" txt_f="27929">]. Sensitivity analyses on the symptom scores will be undertaken to assess the impact of loss to follow-up by either interpolating from available data using the estimated slope of symptoms from the model or using last value carried forward. The later is unlikely to arise in practice for an acute infection, however provides a useful extreme bound in which to interpret results.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35964" xml_f="36826" txt_i="27930" txt_f="28792">Secondary outcomes (satisfaction, enablement, re-consultation and other investigations) will be compared between the two groups using three level regression models (linear and logistic where appropriate). No formal sub-group analyses are planned. However, exploratory analyses will investigate the influence of patient and practitioner demographics on outcomes. The statistical uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of the different strategies will be assessed using non-parametric bootstrap resampling techniques and result in estimates of net monetary benefit values. For the groups of GPs trained in enhanced communication skills and/or CRP testing, the cost analysis will be extended beyond patient level data. Training will lead to additional costs (organising and giving the training and GPs' time investment) which will be included in the analysis[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"><offsets xml_i="36858" xml_f="36860" txt_i="28792" txt_f="28794">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36867" xml_f="37151" txt_i="28794" txt_f="29078">].

Both are promising interventions in reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. A systematic evaluation in daily general practice is required to assess effectiveness. Our inclusion criteria are quite broad as a reflection of daily practice. LRTI is such a commonly seen illness among the full range of patients in primary care that we think the inclusion criteria should enable us to investigate all these patients. Primary inclusion criterion is the GP's suspicion of LRTI being the primary cause of the acute cough episode. GPs are daily facing difficulty in deciding upon management for these patients. The pragmatic approach of this trial leaves them very close to daily practice when considering recruiting the patient for this study. We did however define a group of focal and a group of systemic signs and symptoms in the inclusion criteria, which indicate that this patient has signs and symptoms of an infection of the lower respiratory tract.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38555" xml_f="39708" txt_i="30363" txt_f="31516">A low CRP test result, expected to occur in at least half of these patients with LRTI, will be reassuring for both the GP and the patient that the illness is mild and most probably self-limiting. On the other end of the spectrum, very high test results will help the GP in considering antibiotic treatment or referral to a hospital. To achieve this GPs must be aware of the usefulness of the test and they should be able to properly interpret results. These are crucial conditions for a positive effect of the CRP intervention. If GPs are not aware of the value of the test, other important influences such as time pressure and patients' expectations may dilute any possible effect on antibiotic prescribing. If GPs are able to build the communication skills, which take the latter influences into account, into their routine consultations, long term competence and performance have to be monitored, since maintenance of acquired communication skills is difficult. So even when GPs understand the theory of the test and the principle of the enhanced communication, the question remains whether they will use it to adjust the management of LRTI patients.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39715" xml_f="40215" txt_i="31517" txt_f="32017">We chose a factorial design, as it will enable us to efficiently investigate the interventions by including all participants in both analyses. Furthermore it will give us the opportunity to consider both the individual effects of both interventions and the benefits of receiving both interventions together. Factorials trials do require special considerations at the analysis stage. Interaction between the interventions needs to be investigated, since this can have effect on the power of the study[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42"><offsets xml_i="40247" xml_f="40249" txt_i="32017" txt_f="32019">42</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40256" xml_f="40258" txt_i="32019" txt_f="32021">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40265" xml_f="41829" txt_i="32022" txt_f="33586">In this trial both interventions are targeted at the GPs with impact on patient outcomes. Randomisation at practice level has been chosen in this trial, because there is less risk of contamination by GPs concurrently managing usual care patients, while other GPs manage their patients under the experimental regimen in the same practice. However, since patients yet have to be recruited after randomisation post-randomisation recruitment bias deserves special attention. One may expect that practices not receiving a desired intervention may gradually loose enthusiasm to recruit. As a strategem to prevent this, those practices allocated to the usual care arm, as well as those allocated to one of the arms to which only one intervention will be allocated, will be informed that they will receive a CRP device and/or the communication training after the study period. Recruitment rates across the four groups have to be monitored and baseline characteristics will be described to ensure comparability. Because of the small number of practices involved, randomisation will be restricted carefully with regard to recruitment ability. With a small number of clusters and a large number of patients this trial may be difficult to analyse and risk of loss of power exists if one practice should drop out. In cluster randomised trials the outcome for each patient cannot be assumed to be independent of that of any other patient since the patients within one cluster (practice) are more likely to have similar outcomes. Therefore multi-level analysis will be performed.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41836" xml_f="42059" txt_i="33587" txt_f="33810">Prediction of sample size in cluster randomised trials is difficult given the fact that not only the expected effect size has to be estimated, but also the anticipated cluster size and intra-cluster correlation coefficient[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43"><offsets xml_i="42091" xml_f="42093" txt_i="33810" txt_f="33812">43</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42100" xml_f="42254" txt_i="33812" txt_f="33966">].

If these interventions decrease antibiotic prescribing and enhance patient satisfaction with favourable clinical outcomes, they could be used to enhance the quality of a large number of consultations in primary care, both for common infections and for other conditions.
