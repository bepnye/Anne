Evidence for the effectiveness of any treatment for CFS/ME in primary care, where most patients are seen, is sparse. Recently, a brief, pragmatic treatment for CFS/ME, based on a physiological dysregulation model of the condition, was shown to be successful in improving fatigue and physical functioning in patients in secondary care. The treatment involves providing patients with a readily understandable explanation of their symptoms, from which flows the rationale for a graded rehabilitative plan, developed collaboratively with the therapist. The present trial will test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pragmatic rehabilitation when delivered by specially trained general nurses in primary care. We selected a client-centred counselling intervention, called supportive listening, as a comparison treatment. Counselling has been shown to be as effective as cognitive behaviour therapy for treating fatigue in primary care, is more readily available, and controls for supportive therapist contact time. Our control condition is treatment as usual by the general practitioner (GP).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6712" xml_f="6730" txt_i="1336" txt_f="1354">Methods and design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6741" xml_f="7683" txt_i="1355" txt_f="2297">This study protocol describes the design of an ongoing, single-blind, pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a brief (18 week) self-help treatment, pragmatic rehabilitation, delivered by specially trained nurse-therapists in patients' homes, compared with nurse-therapist delivered supportive listening and treatment as usual by the GP. An economic evaluation, taking a societal viewpoint, is being carried out alongside the clinical trial. Three adult general nurses were trained over a six month period to deliver the two interventions. Patients aged over 18 and fulfilling the Oxford criteria for CFS are assessed at baseline, after the intervention, and again one year later. Primary outcomes are self-reported physical functioning and fatigue at one year, and will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. A qualitative study will examine the interventions' mechanisms of change, and also GPs' drivers and barriers towards referral.</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7745" xml_f="7755" txt_i="2306" txt_f="2316">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7766" xml_f="8027" txt_i="2317" txt_f="2578">Chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as ME (CFS/ME), is a symptomatically-defined condition in which the main complaint is medically unexplained fatigue, lasting at least six months, and of sufficient severity to impair the patient's functioning substantially [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="8058" xml_f="8059" txt_i="2578" txt_f="2579">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8066" xml_f="8067" txt_i="2579" txt_f="2580">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="8098" xml_f="8099" txt_i="2580" txt_f="2581">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8106" xml_f="8210" txt_i="2581" txt_f="2685">].

The explanations for various symptoms of CFS/ME highlight the interaction between psychological and biological factors. They are given to the patient both verbally during an initial discussion with the therapist and in the form of a fully-referenced manual, which has been developed in close collaboration with patients who have successfully completed the treatment.

We will use our results to develop educational programmes for primary care health professionals. If our treatments prove effective and cost-effective in primary care, we envisage that they would be deliverable as specialist services provided or commissioned by primary care trusts. We have taken steps to ensure that our training of nurse therapists in the two treatments is well-described and replicable, so that training and service delivery can be implemented later.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="56850" xml_f="56869" txt_i="47276" txt_f="47295">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="56880" xml_f="56940" txt_i="47296" txt_f="47356">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="56962" xml_f="56984" txt_i="47358" txt_f="47380">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="56995" xml_f="59057" txt_i="47381" txt_f="49443">All authors contributed to the overall design of this study, and are involved in the ongoing management of the trial.
