The FLUID study investigates the non-inferiority of a Treat and Extend (T&amp;E) protocol of 0.5 mg ranibizumab, which allows treatment extension in the presence of incomplete resolution of sub-retinal fluid (SRF) ≤200 μm at the foveal centre relative to a T&amp;E protocol that requires complete resolution of all retinal fluid (i.e., both SRF and intra-retinal fluid [IRF]) in patients with nAMD.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4793" xml_f="4807" txt_i="706" txt_f="720">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4818" xml_f="6171" txt_i="721" txt_f="2067">This 24 month, randomised, phase IV trial has completed recruitment of treatment-naïve patients randomised 1:1 to ranibizumab “intensive” treatment (complete resolution of IRF and SRF) or ranibizumab “relaxed” treatment (resolution of IRF or &gt;200 μm SRF only at foveal centre). Patients in both arms follow a T&amp;E regimen where extension decisions are based upon assessment of lesion activity: loss of ≥5 letters of visual acuity, new haemorrhage, presence of IRF and SRF on an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan. The determination of SRF is conducted at a reading centre while the assessment of IRF is physician-determined. The primary endpoint is the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to 24 months. Secondary endpoints include the mean change in central retinal thickness (CRT) from baseline to 12 and 24 months, the number of ranibizumab injections administered at 12 and 24 months, and the pharmacogenomic assessment of AMD Gene Consortium-identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their association with treatment response. Three hundred and forty seven (347) patients have been recruited by 16 Australian sites within approximately 16 months. A protocol to adjudicate on SRF has been established by the central reading centre and is demonstrating good concordance with investigator assessment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6193" xml_f="6203" txt_i="2069" txt_f="2079">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6214" xml_f="6479" txt_i="2080" txt_f="2341">This study will provide important insights into retreatment criteria for managing nAMD using a T&amp;E regimen.

Further, to avoid the introduction of Investigator bias in making retreatment decisions (since the Investigator is both the assessor and injector at the majority of sites), a central reading centre (Bern Photographic Reading Center, Bern, Switzerland) is employed to mask the study and facilitate compliance of Investigator sites to the protocol. The central reading centre is masked to the randomisation and treatment of the patient. All images collected during the study (OCT, FA, CF, AF) are sent to the central reading centre for analysis. Since the primary aim of the study is to investigate whether retreatment should be based on SRF, masked reading centre assessment of the presence of SRF overrides investigator assessment in determining retreatment interval. While the reading centre will read the IRF component as well, the investigator is allowed discretion if they disagree with the reading centre's interpretation of the IRF component. The adjudication of IRF by the investigator site was implemented by a protocol amendment (3) on 10th December 2014 to ensure greater alignment with standard clinical practice since decisions on IRF often cannot be made in isolation (as is the case with a central reading centre assessment) i.e. requiring more than OCT plus an assessment of the patient’s previous response to anti-VEGF therapy to determine if spaces on the OCT are indicative of active disease or, alternatively, if they represent chronic atrophic changes. This change does not impact the key study question, which is whether SRF needs to be completely resolved in making treatment extension decisions since the adjudication of SRF remains with the central reading centre. The original protocol (and protocol amendments 1 and 2) required that IRF adjudication be performed only by the masked reading centre.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title><offsets xml_i="37148" xml_f="37168" txt_i="29531" txt_f="29551">Statistical analyses</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37179" xml_f="37239" txt_i="29552" txt_f="29612">The sample size for non-inferiority is based on a one-sided </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="37247" xml_f="37248" txt_i="29612" txt_f="29613">t</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="37257" xml_f="37929" txt_i="29613" txt_f="30277">-test with α = 0.025 and 80 % power.

As such, each physician is required to make a judgment on the activity of the CNV lesion. The current best clinical practice states that fluid on an OCT will be considered as an indication of active disease. However, we know that physicians add their own interpretation to the appearance of fluid and make a judgment call on its relevance to disease activity. For example, they question whether a cyst is a chronic atrophic cyst, or whether SRF is simply a failure of the interdigitating photoreceptors and RPE to reconnect tightly thus leaving a small “space”. All of these anatomical features would be interpreted by a reading centre as evidence of fluid and therefore disease activity yet, in many instances, clinicians would not act on these findings. Indeed, in the CATT study, there was a discrepancy of fluid interpretation between the reading centre and investigators in 31 % of adjudications in which the reading centre found fluid where the clinician did not (and thus did not treat with anti-VEGF therapy) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12"><offsets xml_i="40779" xml_f="40781" txt_i="32752" txt_f="32754">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40788" xml_f="40790" txt_i="32754" txt_f="32756">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40797" xml_f="42779" txt_i="32757" txt_f="34735">Therefore, there appears to be an “art” based on years of experience that informs a clinician as to the relevance of certain appearances of fluid and how it has behaved with previous treatments when making their decision to treat in the case of PRN protocols, or extend an interval in the case of T&amp;E protocols. Our research in the FLUID study aims to address these unscripted decisions in order to help all clinicians who are now attempting to make judgments on disease activity for their patients presenting with nAMD. The key question being addressed in the study is whether or not a small amount of SRF (≤200 μm) still present at the end of the often-implemented three initial monthly injections is a variable that affects final VA or, alternatively, if remaining SRF is not associated with worse visual outcomes. Note that the figure of 200 μm was chosen as the upper limit of tolerance for SRF by the study Steering Committee who made the clinical judgement that an accumulation of SRF less than this was acceptable to investigators to not actively treat. In addition, 200 μm was deemed sufficiently large to be reproducibly measured by both site and the central reading centre. If the study does not demonstrate any difference in visual outcomes between the two arms, that is, if there is no difference in VA at 24 months between the relaxed fluid treatment regimen compared to the intensive fluid treatment regimen, then it would suggest that clinicians may adopt a treatment approach in which less ranibizumab injections are required to still achieve optimal visual outcomes. It will also highlight the notion that a clinician’s experience in interpreting OCT findings is a crucial factor in achieving optimal outcomes for that individual patient. The more we can articulate what this experience tells us by way of protocols, the easier it will be for clinicians with less experience in this disease to achieve optimal visual outcomes while minimising treatment burden.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AF</term><def><p>autofluorescence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AMD</term><def><p>age-related macular degeneration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BCVA</term><def><p>best-corrected visual acuity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CATT</term><def><p>comparison of AMD treatments trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CF</term><def><p>colour fundus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNV</term><def><p>choroidal neovascularisation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRT</term><def><p>central retinal thickness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ETDRS</term><def><p>early treatment diabetic retinopathy study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FA</term><def><p>fluorescein angiography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FRB!</term><def><p>Fight Retinal Blindness!</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HD</term><def><p>high definition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICH</term><def><p>International Conference on Harmonization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRC</term><def><p>intra-retinal cysts</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRF</term><def><p>intra-retinal fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>logMAR</term><def><p>logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>nAMD</term><def><p>neovascular age-related macular degeneration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCT</term><def><p>optical coherence tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBAC</term><def><p>Pharmaceuticals Benefits Advisory Committee </p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBS</term><def><p>pharmaceutical benefits scheme</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRN</term><def><p><italic>pro re nata</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p>retinal pigment epithelium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>spectral domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNPs</term><def><p>single-nucleotide polymorphisms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SRF</term><def><p>sub-retinal fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T&amp;E</term><def><p>treat and extend</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VA</term><def><p>visual acuity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VEGF</term><def><p>vascular endothelial growth factor</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Jennifer Arnold and Robyn Guymer are members of the Novartis Advisory Board.
