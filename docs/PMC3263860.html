We also speculate that avoidance of hypoglycemia might have been so important to the parents of these young children that they were reluctant to tighten glycemic control and increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Although responses on the CGM Satisfaction Scale indicated a strong perceived benefit of CGM in warning about hypoglycemia, no significant treatment group differences were found on the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey at 26 weeks. We conjecture that this apparent discordance may be explained by the fact that even though wearing a sensor provided parental reassurance and comfort on a daily basis (as measured on the CGM Satisfaction Scale), sensor wear might not alter an underlying deep-rooted fear of hypoglycemia (as measured on the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey). In fact, for some parents, it is possible that observing downward trends of the CGM glucose levels actually might have made them even less aggressive in trying to achieve tighter glycemic control because of their fear of hypoglycemia. At 26 weeks, the amount of time the glucose level was ≤60 mg/dL was extremely small (median 6 min/day), whereas glucose levels were high for a substantial portion of the day: &gt;200 mg/dL for ∼10 h/day (median) even when a sensor was being worn ≥6 days/week.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29760" xml_f="30291" txt_i="20342" txt_f="20873">In summary, CGM in 4- to 9-year-olds did not improve glycemic control, despite a high degree of parental satisfaction with CGM. We postulate that this may be related to limited use of CGM glucose data in the day-to-day management of diabetes, target glucose levels that are too high, and a persistent, unremitting fear of hypoglycemia in the parents of these young children. Overcoming the barriers that prevent the integration of these glucose data into day-to-day management of pediatric diabetes remains a substantial challenge.</offsets></p></sec><offsets xml_i="30301" xml_f="30308" txt_i="20875" txt_f="20882">
