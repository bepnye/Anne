This was not permitted according to the trial protocol which states that "None of the persons directly involved in the conduct of the trial will have access to the treatment codes." Neither Ian Roberts nor Haleema Shakur had access to the treatment codes. As members of the Trial Steering Committee Ian Roberts and Haleema Shakur were shown selected tables of un-blinded data by the Data Monitoring Committee in order to judge whether the trial should continue. This was permitted by the trial protocol. However, the allegation that they were un-blinded to the data while queries were on-going and prior to the final data analysis is false.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5138" xml_f="5353" txt_i="2182" txt_f="2397">The HIREOS Scale is a modified version of the Oxford Handicap Scale.
