When visualization of the elevated tube was unobstructed, the ligation technique required slightly less time than the coagulation technique although this difference was not statistically significant.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18796" xml_f="19189" txt_i="14089" txt_f="14482">Mesosalpingeal bleeding in 10% of cases was attributed to sharp dissection of adhesions rather than to the salpingectomy alone. Additional precautions to minimize the risk of bleeding included placing the scissors tips either within the cauterized area or well above the endoloop suture. Kleppinger forceps were on the operating room table for either technique to coagulate any bleeding sites.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19196" xml_f="19286" txt_i="14483" txt_f="14573">Both techniques permitted gross confirmation of the removed tube segment by our residents.</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><offsets xml_i="19323" xml_f="19325" txt_i="14573" txt_f="14575">10</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="19338" xml_f="19612" txt_i="14575" txt_f="14849"> The only additional cost associated with either technique was histologic confirmation of the tubal segments. We consider this additional charge ($60 by our pathology service) to be worthwhile, when viewed from a liability perspective in the case of a sterilization failure.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19619" xml_f="20308" txt_i="14850" txt_f="15539">This investigation was not intended to review the contraceptive efficacy of these sterilization techniques, because the small number of patients was only followed up for 48 months postoperatively. Separation of tube segments with the bipolar coagulation technique may be more desirable when one considers the possibility of spontaneous reanastamosis or fistula formation when crushed tubal segments with the ligation method heal in close proximity to each other. It should also be appreciated that surgical reversal is less possible with removal of longer tubal segments. Either salpingectomy technique is, therefore, not usually recommended in women who are either young or of low parity.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20315" xml_f="20983" txt_i="15540" txt_f="16208">Findings from this randomized surgical trial are promising. Either procedure is technically feasible without adding much additional time to remove the tubal segment. Use of smaller-diameter instruments avoids the need for incisional closure and leads to the formation of very small scars at the port sites. Pain from the 3 puncture sites and from partial salpingectomy was usually well tolerated. More experience is necessary to report the incidence of less common complications (such as injury to nearby pelvic structures or need for laparotomy) and to confirm our suspicion that the failure rate is lower with a partial salpingectomy than with tubal occlusion alone.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="presented-at"><p>Presented at the 10<sup>th</sup> International Congress and Endo Expo 2001, SLS Annual Meeting, New York, NY, December 5â 8, 2001</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Sterilization</article-title>. <source>Am Coll Obstet Gynecol Tech Bull</source>. <year>1996</year>;<volume>222</volume>: <fpage>1</fpage>â<lpage>3</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
