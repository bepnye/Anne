Therefore, the supratherapeutic dose was eight-fold higher than the therapeutic dose and due to nondose proportional PK, the exposure was ∼13-fold higher. Lesinurad is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9, with 30%–40% of lesinurad excreted unchanged in urine. In other studies, the moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, fluconazole, caused approximately a 60% increase in lesinurad AUC, whereas lesinurad exposure was approximately doubled in subjects genotyped as CYP2C9 poor metabolizers (hence their exclusion from these studies). Severe renal impairment also doubled lesinurad exposure and moderate hepatic impairment increased lesinurad exposure by 33%. Therefore, the supratherapeutic dose utilized in this study greatly exceeded exposure from any of these conditions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33795" xml_f="33896" txt_i="26644" txt_f="26745">The inclusion of only healthy subjects is consistent with guidance to minimize interfering variables.</offsets><xref rid="b14-dddt-10-3509" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="33941" xml_f="33943" txt_i="26745" txt_f="26747">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33950" xml_f="34317" txt_i="26747" txt_f="27114"> However, it is a limitation of this study as the drug is intended for use in patients with gout, many of whom are overweight and have cardiovascular disease.
