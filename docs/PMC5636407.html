The scar (at least 4.5 cm long) was divided into 3 equal segments (at least 1.5 cm long). Each segment was randomized to either treatment modality A (purpuric: 1.5ms), B (non-purpuric: 10ms), or no treatment (control). Treatment sessions were performed at day 1, 30 and 60. Fluences were delivered according to Fitzpatrick skin type. Follow up visits were at 3 and 6 months. Standardized pictures were taken at each visit and patients were blindly assessed by a physician using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). At baseline and each visit a series of parameters (hemoglobin and melanin concentration, skin texture) were recorded by means of multispectral analysis (Antera 3D</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="4215" xml_f="4217" txt_i="908" txt_f="910">TM</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="4223" xml_f="4409" txt_i="910" txt_f="1093">). Patients were excluded if their scars were on the genitals, hands, or feet; they were &lt; 18 year old; they had a history of light sensitivity.

Hemoglobin concentration decreased significantly in the treated groups, as opposed to the control group. Skin texture varied significantly in the non-purpuric group.</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="4853" xml_f="4864" txt_i="1506" txt_f="1517">CONCLUSION:</offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="4871" xml_f="4995" txt_i="1517" txt_f="1641"> Hypertrophic and keloid scars often result in patient dissatisfaction, functional impairment and decreased quality of life.</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="5000" xml_f="5001" txt_i="1641" txt_f="1642">1</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="5007" xml_f="5123" txt_i="1642" txt_f="1758"> The abundance of treatments in the literature indicates that no available treatment produces a reliable improvement</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="5128" xml_f="5129" txt_i="1758" txt_f="1759">1</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="5135" xml_f="5334" txt_i="1759" txt_f="1958">.

We demonstrated that PDL is effective in improving hypertrophic and keloid scars, and that non-purpuric pulses are superior to purpuric ones in this indication.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5892" xml_f="5912" txt_i="2476" txt_f="2496">Reference Citations:</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5923" xml_f="6166" txt_i="2497" txt_f="2740">1.
