In those patients that did receive midazolam, the use of remifentanil considerably reduced the total dose of midazolam required. Between days 3 and 10 the weighted mean infusion rate of remifentanil remained constant with no evidence of accumulation or of a development of tolerance to remifentanil.

Analgesics and sedatives are also used to allow patients to tolerate nursing procedures and tracheal intubation and to aid in mechanical ventilation. Most commonly, the combined use of a sedative agent with an opioid is used to achieve this. The sedative agent is titrated towards the degree of sedation and opioids are added as judged necessary for pain control.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7943" xml_f="8922" txt_i="2792" txt_f="3771">The pharmacodynamic effects of traditionally used sedative and opioid drugs are unpredictable and often prolonged in the critically ill patient for various reasons. The pharmacokinetics are altered with different volumes of distribution and elimination half-lives. Multiple drugs are given in large doses for prolonged periods, which can lead to drug interactions and tolerance. There is altered organ function with impaired renal/hepatic function, altered regional blood flow, protein and enzyme system dysfunction and altered receptor response. In addition, the most commonly used sedatives and opioids have a context-sensitive half-time that increases with time. Thus, these drugs will accumulate during prolonged use. All opioids have sedative properties to various degrees at high doses. However, traditionally the opioid part of a sedation regime is kept to a minimum to protect against opioid accumulation and an unpredictable recovery/weaning from mechanical ventilation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8929" xml_f="9087" txt_i="3772" txt_f="3930">Remifentanil hydrochloride is a potent, selective μ-opioid receptor agonist that has a rapid onset of action (about 1 min) and quickly achieves steady state [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="9118" xml_f="9119" txt_i="3930" txt_f="3931">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9126" xml_f="9238" txt_i="3931" txt_f="4043">].

The difference between remifentanil and the comparator group was more than 2 days (53.5 hours). The time from starting the weaning process to extubation was also significantly different by more than 1 day (26.6 hours). Reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation by a matter of days will potentially help to reduce the complications associated with prolonged intubation and ventilation. These differences cannot be explained by differing eligibilities to start the weaning process, because there was no difference between the times to start the weaning process in either of the two study groups. The SAS and PI scores were the same in both groups from baseline through the treatment period and to the end of the post-treatment period.
