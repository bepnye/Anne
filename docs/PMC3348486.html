Participants were randomly allocated to immediate treatment with MBCT or to a waitlist condition and life goals were assessed both before and after the treatment or waiting period. Results showed that participants receiving MBCT reported significantly more specific goals post-treatment whereas those allocated to the waitlist condition showed no significant change. Similarly, participants allocated to MBCT regarded themselves as significantly more likely to achieve their important goals post-treatment, whilst again there was no significant change in the waitlist group. Increases in goal specificity were associated with parallel increases in autobiographical memory specificity whereas increases in goal likelihood were associated with reductions in depressed mood. These results suggest that MBCT may enable participants to clarify their important goals and in doing so increase their confidence in their capacity to move in valued life directions.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Goals</kwd><kwd>Specificity</kwd><kwd>Self-regulation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title><offsets xml_i="4515" xml_f="4527" txt_i="1197" txt_f="1209">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4538" xml_f="4694" txt_i="1210" txt_f="1366">A goal can be conceptualised as a future-oriented image of an ideal occurrence, stored in memory for comparison with actual occurrences (Cochran and Tesser </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6"><offsets xml_i="4726" xml_f="4730" txt_i="1366" txt_f="1370">1996</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4737" xml_f="4914" txt_i="1370" txt_f="1547">).

Goals differ in abstractness and scope. Theoretically, it is suggested that at the highest level, goals define the kind of person that an individual wants to be (for example the concept of the ideal self). Embedded within these very broad goals are a hierarchy of lower-order, more concrete goals which specify, in increasing detail, the actions which need to be taken in order to move forward in valued directions.

For example Latham and Locke (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13"><offsets xml_i="6084" xml_f="6088" txt_i="2560" txt_f="2564">1991</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6095" xml_f="6705" txt_i="2564" txt_f="3174">) in a summary of several decades of work on the effects of different types of goals on outcomes in organisational settings suggest that, independent of difficulty, specific challenging goals (‘complete 10 elements of the task by lunchtime’) lead to better outcomes than vague challenging goals (‘try to do your best on this task’), as well as to the spontaneous formation of plans and less variability in performance. Support for the idea that specification of goals is useful in increasing goal progress also comes from research on the formation of implementation intentions (see Gollwitzer and Brandstatter </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11"><offsets xml_i="6738" xml_f="6742" txt_i="3174" txt_f="3178">1997</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6749" xml_f="6828" txt_i="3178" txt_f="3257">).

In so doing, implementation intentions link actions to cueing conditions. Thus a person may have the general goal to “get fit” and may then specify this goal by forming the implementation intention “I will cycle to work on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays” so that the bicycle and the day of the week become cues to action. Research, primarily in health promotion contexts, provides good evidence that encouraging people to specify goals in the form of implementation intentions facilitates action, for example increasing uptake of testicular self-examination (Steadman and Quine </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22"><offsets xml_i="7620" xml_f="7624" txt_i="3999" txt_f="4003">2004</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7631" xml_f="7688" txt_i="4003" txt_f="4060">) or consumption of fruit and vegetables (Chapman et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5"><offsets xml_i="7720" xml_f="7724" txt_i="4060" txt_f="4064">2009</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7731" xml_f="7733" txt_i="4064" txt_f="4066">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7740" xml_f="7988" txt_i="4067" txt_f="4315">If formation of specific goals facilitates goal-directed activity, difficulty in formulating specific goals is likely to produce problems. Since failure to make adequate progress towards desired goals results in negative affect (Carver and Scheier </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"><offsets xml_i="8020" xml_f="8024" txt_i="4315" txt_f="4319">1998</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8031" xml_f="8141" txt_i="4319" txt_f="4429">), lack of specificity of goals may be linked to heightened risk of depression.

Work in the clinical domain has also identified a lack of specificity in goals and plans as a problem for depressed and suicidal patients. For example Vincent et al. (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23"><offsets xml_i="8567" xml_f="8571" txt_i="4783" txt_f="4787">2004</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8578" xml_f="8686" txt_i="4787" txt_f="4895">) showed that patients who have recently engaged in parasuicide do not differ from hospital controls in the </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="8694" xml_f="8700" txt_i="4895" txt_f="4901">number</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="8709" xml_f="9157" txt_i="4901" txt_f="5349"> of goals they have, but describe goals that are significantly less specific and more self-focused. These patients are also able to think of more obstacles on the path to goal attainment and are less able to generate specific plans of how to attain their goals. These findings mirror a number of studies which have shown lack of specificity in other areas of cognition amongst depressed patients, including autobiographical memory (Williams et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29"><offsets xml_i="9190" xml_f="9194" txt_i="5349" txt_f="5353">2007</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9201" xml_f="9251" txt_i="5353" txt_f="5403">) and imagining of future events (Williams et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31"><offsets xml_i="9284" xml_f="9288" txt_i="5403" txt_f="5407">1996</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9295" xml_f="9634" txt_i="5407" txt_f="5746">). Although specificity of memory and specificity of future goals have not been formally linked, there is evidence to suggest that similar processes may contribute to both, since over-generality of memory is known to be associated with the formation of less effective solutions to hypothetical interpersonal problems (Pollock and Williams </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18"><offsets xml_i="9667" xml_f="9671" txt_i="5746" txt_f="5750">2001</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9678" xml_f="9694" txt_i="5750" txt_f="5766">; Sidley et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21"><offsets xml_i="9727" xml_f="9731" txt_i="5766" txt_f="5770">1997</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9738" xml_f="9740" txt_i="5770" txt_f="5772">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9747" xml_f="10284" txt_i="5773" txt_f="6310">The abstract, ruminative cognitive style of people with depression is one factor that may contribute to lack of specificity in goals and plans. Social psychological research suggests that people differ, depending on context, in whether they tend to construe goals at a more abstract or more concrete level, with a focus on ‘why’ questions (which are typical of depressive rumination) tending to activate higher level, abstract goals and a focus on ‘how’ questions, tending to activate lower level, more concrete goals (Rabinovich et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19"><offsets xml_i="10317" xml_f="10321" txt_i="6310" txt_f="6314">2009</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10328" xml_f="10635" txt_i="6314" txt_f="6621">). Consistent with this observation, it has been demonstrated that inducing depressed patients to adopt a concrete self focus, improves their social problem solving relative to adoption of an abstract self focus, and that increased concreteness of problem solutions mediates this effect (Watkins and Moulds </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26"><offsets xml_i="10668" xml_f="10672" txt_i="6621" txt_f="6625">2005</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10679" xml_f="10693" txt_i="6625" txt_f="6639">; see Watkins </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24"><offsets xml_i="10726" xml_f="10730" txt_i="6639" txt_f="6643">2008</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10737" xml_f="11217" txt_i="6643" txt_f="7123">, for a detailed analysis of the impact of abstract versus concrete construal level on repetitive thought and its consequences). Interestingly when people focus on high level, abstract goals they show a tendency to prioritise the desirability, function or purpose of goals over the feasibility or ease with which they can be attained, whereas when they focus on low level goals this leads to prioritisation of issues relating to the process and ease of attainment (Freitas et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10"><offsets xml_i="11250" xml_f="11254" txt_i="7123" txt_f="7127">2001</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11261" xml_f="11706" txt_i="7127" txt_f="7572">). These observations have clear implications for the ability of depressed and suicidal patients, who engage in high levels of rumination and hence tend to operate at the abstract construal level, to self regulate adaptively in the face of unattainable goals—it is likely to be harder for individuals to disengage from desired but unattainable goals and re-engage with new goals when goal desirability rather than attainability takes precedence.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11713" xml_f="11946" txt_i="7573" txt_f="7806">Given the potential problems posed by a lack of specificity in life goals it is important to consider how goal specificity might be improved through treatment.

Indeed, treatments such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Hayes et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12"><offsets xml_i="12101" xml_f="12105" txt_i="7888" txt_f="7892">1999</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12112" xml_f="12423" txt_i="7892" txt_f="8203">) explicitly encourage participants to clarify valued life directions (high level strivings) and then set specific goals which enable them to put these values into action (p. 227), whilst Problem Solving Therapy involves goal setting as a component in the step-by-step process taught to clients (Malouff et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16"><offsets xml_i="12456" xml_f="12460" txt_i="8203" txt_f="8207">2007</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12467" xml_f="12625" txt_i="8207" txt_f="8365">).

Goals coded as “1” are those which specify an action in a specific life domain, but which could be divided into further sub-tasks (e.g., “get fit”, “eat sensibly” “get on better with my family”). Goals coded as “2” are those which specify actions in specific domains and which could be followed by the average person without the need for further clarification (e.g., “go swimming”, “get my driving licence”). Finally goals coded as “3” are those which specify actions in a specific domain, as in “2”, but include further specifying information concerning how or when the action would be completed (e.g., “arrange a meeting next week to speak to my boss about reducing my hours” “sign up for a photography course at the local college this autumn”).

Participants were instructed to retrieve a memory of a specific event in response to each word. A specific memory was defined as a memory of an event which lasted less than a day and occurred at a particular time and place. Participants were given three practice words before the task commenced and practice continued until specific memories had been retrieved to at least two of the three practice cues. All participants were able to retrieve at least two specific memories during the practice phase with the help of prompting and the use of examples. In the test phase participants were given 30s to respond to each cue word and were requested not to repeat memories or retrieve memories of events occurring in the past 7 days. In line with previous research, memories were coded as specific, extended, categoric, semantic associate or as an omission by one of two research assessors, both blind to treatment condition.

In this case, changes in mood mediated the effect of randomisation group on goal likelihood change.

First, research suggests that individuals who adopt an abstract mode of processing (which is characteristic of, but not confined to, people with depression), are more likely to construe goals at an abstract level. Studies which have used experimental manipulations to increase concrete thinking have demonstrated concurrent increases in the concreteness of problem solving plans and autobiographical memory specificity (Watkins and Moulds </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26"><offsets xml_i="37491" xml_f="37495" txt_i="29738" txt_f="29742">2005</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37502" xml_f="37525" txt_i="29742" txt_f="29765">; Watkins and Teasdale </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27"><offsets xml_i="37558" xml_f="37562" txt_i="29765" txt_f="29769">2001</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37569" xml_f="37571" txt_i="29769" txt_f="29771">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28"><offsets xml_i="37604" xml_f="37608" txt_i="29771" txt_f="29775">2004</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37615" xml_f="37738" txt_i="29775" txt_f="29898">), and previous studies have reported a similar effect of a course of MBCT on the autobiographical memory (Williams et al. </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32"><offsets xml_i="37771" xml_f="37775" txt_i="29898" txt_f="29902">2000</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37782" xml_f="38867" txt_i="29902" txt_f="30987">). If MBCT is able to produce a shift in mode of processing it would be expected to also produce changes in the concreteness of goals. The increase in goal specificity observed may represent such an effect. Consistent with the idea of a broader increase in concreteness of thinking produced by MBCT increases in goal specificity and increases in autobiographical memory specificity were moderately correlated for the sample as a whole and for those allocated to MBCT. MBCT may also, through its cognitive therapy elements, and through its general emphasis on self-compassion, encourage participants to reflect on the specifics of their current lifestyle (through monitoring pleasant and unpleasant events, the identification of nourishing and depleting activities and so on) and in so doing recognise both aspects that are functional, bring pleasure or enhance well being, and those that are unhelpful and deplete energy and resources. These exercises may naturally lead individuals to think in more concrete terms about how to set manageable goals that will enhance future well-being.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38874" xml_f="39699" txt_i="30988" txt_f="31813">Although the findings of the current research are interesting and consistent with existing literature in the area, there are a number of limitations that must be considered. Most notably the data reported here were collected as part of a small pilot trial of MBCT for chronic suicidal depression. As a result the sample is relatively restricted in its clinical characteristics, potentially limiting generalisability, and was also small in size, limiting power. Further although it was beyond the scope of the current study to include an active control treatment, comparing the effects on life goals of MBCT and another active treatment that addresses goal setting processes more directly (for example problem solving therapy, or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) would be a particularly interesting line for future research.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39706" xml_f="40583" txt_i="31814" txt_f="32691">It was not possible from this study to determine the extent to which changes in specificity were a function of changes in the content of goals, the increasing specification of existing goals and/or the increased prioritisation of existing goals higher in specificity. Future research on larger samples would benefit in particular from exploring how goal content changes. It was not our impression from examining the data that people who had received MBCT changed markedly in the nature of the goals they described, but a formal investigation of goal content change, perhaps including qualitative work examining patients’ perceptions of changes in life goals would be informative. Finally these findings are limited by the absence of a follow-up period and therefore it is not clear whether changes in goal specificity persist over time or are predictive of longer-term outcome.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40590" xml_f="41425" txt_i="32692" txt_f="33527">Despite these limitations, the findings remain of interest. It is important to understand not just how treatments such as MBCT target clinical symptoms, but also the mechanisms through which such treatments build resilience and reduce risk of relapse. Goals contribute to a person’s sense of meaning in life and the ability to set and effectively pursue goals is at the heart of adaptive self-regulation. Although preliminary, the data presented here suggests that MBCT is able to increase both the specification of important life goals and the perceived likelihood of their attainment, changes which may have significant implications for a person’s ability to move forward in life with confidence. As such examining in more detail how MBCT influences goal-related self-regulation is likely to be a promising angle for future research.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank our participants for giving their time to complete our assessments.
