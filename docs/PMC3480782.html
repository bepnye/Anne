Clinically, it is characterized by four major symptoms – rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal itching, and nasal congestion. Allergic rhinitis is a global health problem.

Patient preference for a particular INC is largely influenced by the sensory attributes of the nasal spray, which in turn is largely dependent on formulation factors. For instance, preservatives in the spray formulation may produce nasal irritation, reducing tolerability. Other excipients may impart unacceptable taste or odor to the formulation. Further, the relative osmotic pressure or tonicity of the formulation can modulate nasal retention and absorption, thereby potentially influencing clinical efficacy.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7406" xml_f="7584" txt_i="3203" txt_f="3381">Intranasal ciclesonide (CIC) was introduced in the Indian market in 2008.

There were no statistically significant differences between the two drugs for other sensory attributes either immediately or 2 min after dosing. Previous studies with nasal steroids have reported that patients usually prefer scentless and tasteless preparations but in our study patients preferred fluticasone that has a mild fruity odor, while ciclesonide has no odor but evokes a more irritating sensation in the nasal mucosa. Although the immediate efficacy of the two drugs was comparable, the differences in sensory attributes probably led to the greater preference for fluticasone over ciclesonide.

As newer intranasal corticosteroids are introduced, product attributes and immediate efficacy may decide the patient preference and adherence to therapy and thereby reflect on treatment outcome. In this study, although their immediate efficacy and tolerability were comparable, an overall patient preference was for fluticasone propionate formulation rather than ciclesonide. The former was also preferred over ciclesonide with respect to the sensory attributes of scent, soothing feel, and less nasal irritation. Comparing efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability with respect to various sensory attributes on continued or repeated use deserves further exploration.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge with gratitude the approval and logistical facilities extended by the Director, Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (IPGME&amp;R) and SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, India, for conducting this trial and Head, Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the same institute, for provision of the study drugs.
