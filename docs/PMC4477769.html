In the Middle East, healthcare seemingly has undergone a major change with an increased stress on family-centered care (FCC), which is defined as healthcare that recognizes the need for a partnership among physicians, patients, and patients’ families in a suitable and holistic manner. Central to the FCC approach is the assurance that decisions will be made that respect the wants, needs, and preferences of the patients and their families (</offsets><xref rid="b3-epj-07-1078" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9408" xml_f="9409" txt_i="4203" txt_f="4204">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9416" xml_f="9958" txt_i="4204" txt_f="4746">). When a child is admitted to a hospital, the entire family is affected. In providing care, nurses, doctors, and others who provide care for the child must consider the impact of the child’s being admitted to the hospital on all of the members of the family. This precept fits well with FCC, which is “a way of caring for children and their families by providing health services that ensure that care is planned around the whole family, not just the child who is ill. In this context, all of the family members are known as care receivers” (</offsets><xref rid="b5-epj-07-1078" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10001" xml_f="10002" txt_i="4746" txt_f="4747">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10009" xml_f="10376" txt_i="4747" txt_f="5114">). In the past, the psychological needs of children and their families have been of little concern to the medical community. Thus, therapeutic environments were designed to satisfy only the patient’s physical needs, and this approach of providing only technological services may not be very suitable for the health and welfare of the sick children or their families (</offsets><xref rid="b6-epj-07-1078" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10419" xml_f="10420" txt_i="5114" txt_f="5115">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10427" xml_f="10781" txt_i="5115" txt_f="5469">). Many studies have focused on the effects on families when severe or chronic sicknesses afflict their children (1, 7, and 8). In recent years, the focus has been shifting slowly to the needs and preferences of families. Previous studies have shown incongruence between the perceived needs of families and the provision of care by healthcare personnel (</offsets><xref rid="b9-epj-07-1078" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10824" xml_f="10825" txt_i="5469" txt_f="5470">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10832" xml_f="11023" txt_i="5470" txt_f="5661">).

The philosophy of FCC involves holistic care and requires collaboration with members of the family to plan, intervene, and evaluate the healthcare. Consequently, it changes the concept of conducting interventions on the child and family to performing interventions with the family (</offsets><xref rid="b12-epj-07-1078" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="11626" xml_f="11628" txt_i="6118" txt_f="6120">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11635" xml_f="11886" txt_i="6120" txt_f="6371">). FCC considers each family as a unique unit and focuses on the permanent influence of the family on a child’s life. In addition, this approach emphasizes the provision of care that involves healthcare workers, the sick children, and their families (</offsets><xref rid="b13-epj-07-1078" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="11930" xml_f="11932" txt_i="6371" txt_f="6373">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11939" xml_f="12156" txt_i="6373" txt_f="6590">).

This may be due in part to a lack of understanding of the family’s needs and to a lack of knowledge regarding various elements of the patient’s care.

The Chronbach’s alpha test was used to determine the reliability of the questionnaire. Principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation was calculated to assess the underlying structure of the 30 items in the FCC questionnaire. The items were designed to index three constructs, i.e., participatory support, educational support, and psychological support. After varimax rotation, these three factors accounted for 22.1, 16.1, and 12.9% of the variance, respectively. One of each child’s parents completed a two-part questionnaire in the presence of a researcher. The first part of the questionnaire solicited socio- demographic information about the child and the parent who completed the questionnaire. The second part consisted of 30 questions regarding the satisfaction of the parent with the care the child received. The scale of items ranged from 1 to 5. Of the 30 questions, eight were related to participatory care, 10 to educational support, and 12 to psychological support. Satisfaction was ranked by four items, i.e., “Not satisfied, Weak, Moderate, and Good” with corresponding scores of Weak (0–29), Moderate (30–59), and Good (60–99). The findings showed the items and factor loadings for the rotated factors, with loadings less than 0.40 omitted to improve clarity.

The total mean score of items related to the satisfaction of parents can be consider as interval (quantitative) variables, therefore, due to the normal distribution of the total score, the paired sample t-test was used to compare the scores before and after intervention. The extent of the parents’ satisfaction concerning the importance of FCC was analyzed using descriptive statistics, means, standard deviations, and frequency tables. The means of the family’s satisfaction before and after the intervention were presented in table form. Also, the paired sample t-test was used to compare the means of family satisfaction before and after intervention.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><label><offsets xml_i="18189" xml_f="18191" txt_i="11527" txt_f="11529">3.</offsets></label><title><offsets xml_i="18206" xml_f="18213" txt_i="11529" txt_f="11536">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18224" xml_f="18489" txt_i="11537" txt_f="11802">Of the subjects, 51.4% were between three months and three years old, 60% were males, 61.4% were the first child, 68.57% had been hospitalized for more than four days, 74.29% had social security insurance, and 67.14% had been hospitalized earlier in the same ward (</offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-epj-07-1078"><offsets xml_i="18533" xml_f="18540" txt_i="11802" txt_f="11809">Table 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18547" xml_f="18671" txt_i="11809" txt_f="11933">).

In this study, the satisfaction score reached 90% after FCC was implemented. In fact, 90% of parents expressed their satisfaction with the care provided. Such a high level of satisfaction was similar to the findings of a previous investigation, which reported 99.8% satisfaction (</offsets><xref rid="b18-epj-07-1078" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="22140" xml_f="22142" txt_i="14919" txt_f="14921">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22149" xml_f="22442" txt_i="14921" txt_f="15214">).

The results of a previous study highlighted that 174 family members of patients had participated (75 in the control group and 99 in the experimental group), and the average scores were 3.2 (control group) and 3.5 (experimental group) at follow-up after FCC intervention (</offsets><xref rid="b20-epj-07-1078" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="22955" xml_f="22957" txt_i="15626" txt_f="15628">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22964" xml_f="23980" txt_i="15628" txt_f="16644">). These results predicted positive interactions between family members and nurses. Such healthcare, collaboration, and support would have been impossible without the establishment of good relationships between the healthcare providers and the patients’ families. Application of this approach is necessary to prevent complications during hospitalization. In addition, it can lead to the provision of more holistic care, increased satisfaction of families of hospitalized children, and higher quality care. A survey conducted in Children’s Hospital at the University of Virginia (in the U.S.) indicated that sharing information and involving the family in a patient’s care had the following effects: 1) A significant increase in the patient’s and the family’s satisfaction, 2) a decrease in the clinical workload, and 3) an increase in the staff’s satisfaction. The results of this research underscored the significance of using components of FCC and encouraging parents’ participation in the care of their children (</offsets><xref rid="b21-epj-07-1078" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="24024" xml_f="24026" txt_i="16644" txt_f="16646">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24033" xml_f="24179" txt_i="16646" txt_f="16792">).

This resulted from parents being allowed to participate in making decisions about the healthcare of their children, which resulted in the development of good relationships between the parents and the healthcare providers. Therefore, essential changes should be made in the organizational culture of healthcare settings to incorporate the principles of FCC in their decision-making activities in education and the delivery of service. With regard to increasing inclination for extensive utilization of FCC in healthcare organizations, more emphasis on its principles, with purposeful operations, can be expected in the coming years. Furthermore, incorporating an FCC syllabus in the nursing curriculum is recommended because of its beneficial impacts on clinical practice.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This project was sponsored by the Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Islamic Azad University, Chaloos Branch.
