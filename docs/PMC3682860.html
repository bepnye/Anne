Participants were recruited in 19 women’s shelter facilities and 22 homeless shelter facilities across The Netherlands and randomly allocated to the intervention group (CTI) or the control group (care-as-usual). They were interviewed four times in nine months: once before leaving the shelter, and then at three, six and nine months after leaving the shelter. Quality of life (primary outcome for abused women) and recurrent loss of housing (primary outcome for homeless people) as well as secondary outcomes (e.g. care needs, self-esteem, loneliness, social support, substance use, psychological distress and service use) were assessed during the interviews. In addition, the model integrity of CTI was investigated during the data collection period.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5624" xml_f="5634" txt_i="1549" txt_f="1559">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5645" xml_f="6009" txt_i="1560" txt_f="1924">Based on international research CTI is expected to be an appropriate intervention for clients making the transition from institutional to community living.

Organisations were also required to assign an internal coach who was responsible for monitoring the model integrity of the intervention. The CTI workers and the internal coach met fortnightly to discuss the CTI clients and possible problems concerning the working conditions of the CTI workers, such as their caseload. The internal coach monitored the execution of the intervention with the aid of a CTI monitor record. The CTI workers documented their activities in a CTI record for each client. With the aid of these CTI records and the CTI monitor records, we are able to measure the CTI model integrity (Conover &amp; Herman, unpublished Fidelity Manual, June, 2012). Consequently, we are able to link the results of CTI to the extent to which the intervention was carried out in accordance with the model.

Nineteen women’s shelters (run by nine organisations) and 22 shelters for homeless people (run by nine organisations) participated in the studies. These shelter facilities for homeless people could be best characterised as transitional housing facilities. Some participants recruited in these facilities have not experienced literal homelessness, seeing that not all of them have spent time on the street, in emergency shelters or doubled-up with family or friends before entering these facilities. However, the participants may be characterised as homeless persons using a broader definition; all participants entered these transitional housing facilities because they lacked the resources or support networks needed to obtain housing [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53"><offsets xml_i="28638" xml_f="28640" txt_i="20699" txt_f="20701">53</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="28647" xml_f="28649" txt_i="20701" txt_f="20703">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28656" xml_f="28704" txt_i="20704" txt_f="20752">Clients were eligible for participation if they:</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28711" xml_f="28741" txt_i="20753" txt_f="20783">• were aged 18 years or older;</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28748" xml_f="28858" txt_i="20784" txt_f="20894">• were willing to receive support from the shelter organisation during and after leaving the shelter facility;</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28865" xml_f="28970" txt_i="20895" txt_f="21000">• were staying in the shelter facility due to intimate partner or honour-related violence (abused women);</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28977" xml_f="29058" txt_i="21001" txt_f="21082">• had been staying in the shelter facility for at least six weeks (abused women);</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29065" xml_f="29180" txt_i="21083" txt_f="21198">• would be staying in the shelter facility for no longer than 14 months at the date of departure (homeless people);</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29187" xml_f="29291" txt_i="21199" txt_f="21303">• had been given a date of departure from the shelter facility or had received a declaration of urgency;</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29298" xml_f="29416" txt_i="21304" txt_f="21422">• were going to depart to supported or independent housing where no daily supervision or support would be present; and</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29423" xml_f="29499" txt_i="21423" txt_f="21499">• would be required to pay rent or housing costs in their new accommodation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29506" xml_f="29784" txt_i="21500" txt_f="21778">Clients were unable to participate if they were going to live in a region where none of the participating organisations provided services.

Each group should contain 91 participants to detect this difference with 80% power (α = .05, two-sided) in the current study. Assuming the ICC to be .05 due to clustering of clients in case managers and an average number of five clients per case manager, the number of participants in each group should be increased to 109. Accounting for 30% attrition, the intended sample size is 312 for the total group.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="52315" xml_f="52323" txt_i="40910" txt_f="40918">Analyses</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="52334" xml_f="53250" txt_i="40919" txt_f="41835">Statistical analyses will be performed using the software program IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0.

The primary outcomes of the studies (improvement of quality of life during the nine-month follow-up and decrease in days unhoused over nine months), as well as other outcomes, will be compared between groups according to the intention-to-treat principle using mixed-effects analyses to correct for clustering. Quality of life at baseline will be added as covariate. Dichotomous outcomes will be compared using multi-level logistic regression and odds ratios will be reported. In the analyses corrections will be made for important characteristics such as age, gender, duration of victimisation, duration of homelessness and severity of psychological problems.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title><offsets xml_i="53300" xml_f="53310" txt_i="41838" txt_f="41848">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="53321" xml_f="53497" txt_i="41849" txt_f="42025">Although it is widely acknowledged that socially vulnerable people such as abused women and homeless people leaving shelter facilities merit appropriate care in the community [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"><offsets xml_i="53529" xml_f="53531" txt_i="42025" txt_f="42027">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="53538" xml_f="53539" txt_i="42027" txt_f="42028">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35"><offsets xml_i="53571" xml_f="53573" txt_i="42028" txt_f="42030">35</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="53580" xml_f="53581" txt_i="42030" txt_f="42031">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47"><offsets xml_i="53613" xml_f="53615" txt_i="42031" txt_f="42033">47</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="53622" xml_f="53803" txt_i="42033" txt_f="42214">], there is a notable lack of evidence-based interventions which systematically address the needs of these populations.

Consequently, follow-up rates in these studies are expected to be satisfactory. An additional strength of the studies is that the participants included will probably form an accurate reflection of the Dutch shelter population due to the participation of shelter facilities from different regions, the inclusion of clients with alcohol or drugs dependence and the inclusion of clients with a poor understanding of the Dutch language.

Although there is a wide variety of clients in women’s shelter facilities, only victims of intimate partner or honour-related violence were selected for the study in women’s shelters in order to establish a homogeneous group of participants. For this reason, statements about other specific groups in women’s shelter facilities, such as victims of human trafficking, cannot be made.
