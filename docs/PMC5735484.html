The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Since the study was conducted in pediatric population, consent for participation was obtained from the parents/guardians. They were explained that the participation was voluntary and refusal would not affect adequate anesthesia care. On their approval, written informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians of the participants. A total of sixty consecutive children belonging to age group of 1–8 years and American Society of Anesthesiologist Grade of I and II (ASA) undergoing inguinal hernia repair in our institute were selected for the study. Children with upper respiratory tract infection, heart diseases, neurological diseases, receiving antiepileptic drugs, cough syrups, antihistamines, analgesics, and contraindication to regional anesthesia were excluded from the study. Since this was the first study of its kind, an arbitrary sample size of sixty was selected taking into consideration, the frequency of pediatric hernia repair surgery in our institute from previous years. Sixty children were divided into three groups, namely, Group I (control), Group II (oral clonidine), and Group III (regional clonidine) of twenty patients each, based on random numbers generated from computer. Group I received oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) and regional bupivacaine (0.5%, 0.25 ml/kg), Group II received oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) with oral clonidine (4 μg/kg) and regional bupivacaine (0.5%, 0.25 ml/kg), and Group III received oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) and regional clonidine (4 μg/kg) with bupivacaine (0.5%, 0.25 ml/kg) [</offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="9761" xml_f="9768" txt_i="5676" txt_f="5683">Table 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9775" xml_f="10200" txt_i="5683" txt_f="6108">].
