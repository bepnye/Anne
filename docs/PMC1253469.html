These seven companies were also slightly more likely to perceive health promotion as important and to have offered health promotion programs in the past, compared to other eligible worksites (differences not statistically significant). Later in the trial, one worksite withdrew from the intervention condition and another withdrew from the control condition; both cited lack of time as reason for withdrawal.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20759" xml_f="20769" txt_i="16030" txt_f="16040">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20780" xml_f="21165" txt_i="16041" txt_f="16426">This paper reports on the process and outcome of our efforts to recruit small manufacturing worksites employing multiethnic, low-wage workforces into a cancer prevention intervention trial.

An additional seven worksites initially consented but withdrew very early in the trial. Among worksites eligible to participate, we observed no statistically significant differences between those that consented and those that declined to participate in the trial with regard to workforce composition, anticipated expansion of the workforce (financial outlook), and perceived importance and history of heath promotion activities and occupational health and safety programs. In sum, we found that the racial and ethnic composition of the workforce, financial outlook, and perceived importance and experience with health programs were not barriers to adoption in cancer prevention trials in this sample of worksites.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22013" xml_f="23378" txt_i="17151" txt_f="18516">The study had a few limitations. First, the survey relied on self-reports by a worksite representative, and we did not attempt to validate the information provided. Second, using the RE-AIM measures, we attempted to assess worksite participation in a cancer prevention research trial as a proxy measure for adoption of a cancer prevention program. Participation in a research trial is not the same as adoption of a program. And finally, our pre-recruitment survey did not contain measures that allowed us to characterize differences between adopters and decliners, suggesting that additional measures may be needed, the development of which might rely on qualitative, open-ended questions on factors that promote or inhibit adoption. The survey administrators noted anecdotally that employer reasons for adoption included having a family member with a history of cancer; viewing participation as a low-cost, value-added benefit for employees during a time of tight labor markets; wanting to take advantage of our occupational health and safety expert consultations; and believing that a healthy workforce is a more productive one. Common reasons noted by employers for declining to participate were lack of time and poor labor-management relations. These reasons may form the basis for distinguishing adopters and decliners in recruitment surveys for future trials.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23385" xml_f="24235" txt_i="18517" txt_f="19367">Our findings have several important implications for the HD-SB trial and for other future worksite-based trials. First, although our adoption rate was 20%, a systematic assessment of the adoption rate using the RE-AIM framework indicates strong external validity for HD-SB trial findings: we found no significant differences between eligible worksites that adopted the cancer prevention trial and those that declined. We may generalize the findings of our main trial to other small manufacturing businesses that are located in urban areas and employ multiethnic, low-wage workers. The application of the RE-AIM measures for worksite adoption used here represents a key strength of our trial: few prior studies have reported explicitly on the percentage and representativeness of worksites that are willing to adopt or try a health promotion program (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"><offsets xml_i="24267" xml_f="24269" txt_i="19367" txt_f="19369">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24276" xml_f="25275" txt_i="19369" txt_f="20368">). Second, the results provide guidance to future researchers and practitioners in estimating likely rates of adoption and early withdrawals. When recruiting small manufacturing worksites, which may be particularly vulnerable to volatile economic conditions and production schedules, it may be necessary to recruit additional worksites to allow for early withdrawals and avoid threatening the trial’s statistical power. A related point is that when attempting to reach worksites to assess eligibility for recruitment, researchers ought to use a short survey instrument that they can administer conveniently, preferably by telephone. Third, the high mean level of reported importance of occupational health and safety programs among all eligible worksites is noteworthy, suggesting that these programs may represent an attractive intervention component for small manufacturing businesses. This level of interest in health and safety has not been evident in studies of larger manufacturing worksites (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"><offsets xml_i="25307" xml_f="25309" txt_i="20368" txt_f="20370">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25316" xml_f="25317" txt_i="20370" txt_f="20371">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"><offsets xml_i="25349" xml_f="25351" txt_i="20371" txt_f="20373">37</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25358" xml_f="25360" txt_i="20373" txt_f="20375">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25367" xml_f="25837" txt_i="20376" txt_f="20846">Recruitment for this trial took place within a larger social context: the decline of the U.S. manufacturing sector. U.S. manufacturing companies often are in precarious financial situations, or they may perceive that they have too little time to commit to a health promotion trial. On the other hand, they may view such an endeavor as a “free” resource. Our anecdotal data support both of these hypotheses, which can be subjected to rigorous assessment in future trials.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25844" xml_f="25955" txt_i="20847" txt_f="20958">Reducing racial/ethnic and class-based health disparities is a major focus for the U.S. Public Health Service (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="25987" xml_f="25989" txt_i="20958" txt_f="20960">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25996" xml_f="25997" txt_i="20960" txt_f="20961">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"><offsets xml_i="26029" xml_f="26031" txt_i="20961" txt_f="20963">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26038" xml_f="26757" txt_i="20963" txt_f="21682">). Intervention research is essential to developing effective methods for reducing the disproportionate cancer risk associated with health behaviors and occupational exposures among immigrant, multiethnic and multi-racial, less-educated, and low-wage workers. Our results indicate that small manufacturing worksites are a viable community-based channel for reaching low-wage, multiethnic populations with cancer prevention programs, but that we can expect low adoption rates within this sector. Future intervention studies in these settings need to address the concerns of small businesses and to assess systematically the worksite characteristics that promote participation in trials and, ultimately, program adoption.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for this study is provided by National Cancer Institute grant number 5 P01 CA75308-02 and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.

				</p><p>Hello, my name is ______________________. I am calling from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We recently sent your company a questionnaire for a project we are conducting with small businesses in the Boston area. The questionnaire was called the “Health Survey of Small Businesses in Massachusetts.”  We have reviewed the survey and have made changes to shorten it. Since we did not receive a completed survey from your company, would you be able to take about five minutes now to answer a few questions?</p><p>

							</p><p>I would like to thank you for your participation in the Health Survey of Small Businesses. One of the purposes of this survey is to identify potential participants for the Cancer Prevention in Small Businesses project, funded by the National Cancer Institute. The goal of the project is to develop a national model for worksite cancer prevention. The study offers two years of health programming provided by experienced staff at no cost to you. We will focus on healthy eating, increased physical activity, and safety issues.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are you able to make the decision to participate in a program like this one on your own?
