Treatment interventions were unsupervised and done under free-living conditions. During the closed-loop period, a model-predictive control algorithm directed insulin delivery, and prandial insulin delivery was calculated with a standard bolus wizard.

The bolus calculations provided by the study pump's built-in bolus calculator took into account carbohydrate content of meals, insulin on board, and entered capillary blood glucose readings. The algorithm was initialised by pre-programmed basal insulin rates downloaded from the study pump. Participants' bodyweight and total daily insulin dose were entered at set-up. During closed-loop operation, the algorithm adapted itself to a particular participant.

Thus, in adults who are actively engaged with self-management, closed-loop insulin delivery might provide additional benefits, justifying its use in this particular population. The overall positive feedback from participants reflected the acceptance of closed-loop technology during daily diabetes management, albeit with some limitations to its use, which might affect user adherence and experience.
