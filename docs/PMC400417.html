Twenty-two patients with active RA were enrolled in a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 30 μg IFN-β-1a by weekly self-injection for 24 weeks. The primary outcome of the study was safety. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at 24 weeks. There were no significant differences in adverse events reported in the two groups. Fewer than 20% of patients in each arm of the study achieved an ACR 20 response at 24 weeks (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="3601" xml_f="3603" txt_i="687" txt_f="689">P </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="3612" xml_f="3965" txt_i="689" txt_f="1042">= 0.71).

The advent of biologic response modifiers has changed the paradigm of treatment options. However, despite the introduction of anti-cytokine therapy, there remains a significant unmet need for additional therapy in the treatment of RA that stems from several existing problems, namely that no one therapy or combination of therapies works for all patients, that patients who do respond rarely achieve remission, that therapy can lose efficacy over time, and that side effects can limit the utility of any therapy. These issues result in a demand for compounds that have minimal side effects while providing disease modification both by ameliorating signs and symptoms of RA and by retarding the erosion of joint tissue.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5045" xml_f="5181" txt_i="1917" txt_f="2053">Recombinant human IFN-β is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="5212" xml_f="5213" txt_i="2053" txt_f="2054">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5220" xml_f="5445" txt_i="2054" txt_f="2279">].

Using a more liberal ITT last-observation-carried-forward analysis, it appears that 44% of patients were responding at the time of their last visit but chose to leave the study anyway. The patients' decision to terminate the study reflects either their perceptions of lack of efficacy despite having achieved a 20% improvement in some cases or a lack of improvement substantial enough to warrant continuing in the study in the face of mild adverse events.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18697" xml_f="18707" txt_i="14395" txt_f="14405">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18718" xml_f="19078" txt_i="14406" txt_f="14766">The results of this small pilot study suggest that IFN-β-1a, while generally safe, may not be a significantly efficacious agent for the treatment of RA.
