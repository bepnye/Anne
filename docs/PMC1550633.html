In our case, recruitment using Internet technologies including email, electronic discussion boards, Usenet forums, and websites did not prove to be an effective approach for soliciting young subjects to participate in our research. Possible reasons are discussed, including the participants' perspective. A major challenge is to differentiate trustable and legitimate messages from spam and fraudulent misinformation on the Internet. From the researchers' perspective, approaches are needed to engage larger samples, to verify participants' attributes, and to evaluate and adjust for potential biases associated with Internet recruitment.</offsets></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>data collection</kwd><kwd>World Wide Web</kwd><kwd>research subjects</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title><offsets xml_i="7525" xml_f="7537" txt_i="3103" txt_f="3115">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7548" xml_f="7906" txt_i="3116" txt_f="3474">The advent of the Internet has radically changed communication and information dissemination patterns among individuals and in society at large.

After allowing for taxes and shipping charges, a Can $20-dollar certificate is worth only about Can $14 thereby limiting what can be bought. Despite this limitation with electronic gift certificates, it was chosen as the incentive in the study because of the anonymity it provided.

Instead of sending the referral's email to the study coordinator, the study website could be programmed so that the referrers could send invitation emails using their own email addresses directly to their friends. Spammers have exploited various deceptive techniques such as employing fake sender email addresses from legitimate domains, embedding real logos from legitimate websites onto messages, and using misleading or enticing (such as money or free prizes) subject lines.

Since it is simple for anyone to apply for new email accounts from free email service providers such as the Hotmail and the Yahoo Mail, the same individual can create multiple identities and participate in a study more than once. This issue is particularly difficult in studies using discussion boards or Usenet forums where unique login information (username/password) or URL cannot be assigned to each participant. The use of cookies is only effective to detect multiple participations if the participants access the study website twice from the same computer.

For example, one can post the study invitation on those discussion boards or Usenet forums that have higher posting traffic, such as those related to computers. However, it is bad ânetiquetteâ to cross-post in forums with out-of-context messages, such as study recruitment of a health behavior study in a computer-related forum. Such messages will either be ignored or removed. In some cases, the sender will be âflamedâ (responded to by overly harsh and often hostile terms). Another possibility is to purchase advertisement space such as in the form of page banner on websites that are popular among target users.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="35669" xml_f="35679" txt_i="28080" txt_f="28090">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="35690" xml_f="36281" txt_i="28091" txt_f="28682">This study is one of the first attempts to investigate the feasibility of Internet recruitment in the âage of spam.â In our specific case our recruitment strategies were not efficient. However, we caution against generalizing our negative results. Internet recruitment may prove viable if studies are conducted on a larger scale, if the right newsgroups are targeted, the right incentives chosen, and the right wording is used. Recruitment announcements in the form of Web page banners can potentially be viewed by tens of thousands, if not more, of online users on high traffic Web portals.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36288" xml_f="36835" txt_i="28683" txt_f="29230">From the researchers' perspective, the validity of study results can be compromised by limitations in verifying participants' attributes such as age. For motivated participants, it is not clear how to differentiate trustable and legitimate messages on the Internet. Researchers using Internet recruitment in their studies should focus on ways to improve the perceived legitimacy of the invitation message. For example, participants should be able to easily identify the study website as belonging to a legitimate organization such as a university.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36842" xml_f="37093" txt_i="29231" txt_f="29482">Success in recruiting participants online depends on many factors, which are similar to those for getting responses in traditional mail and telephone surveys.

It is clear that there is no single strategy that can guarantee good response rates in all situations, due to variations in study characteristics, target populations, type and amount of incentives, sponsorships, length of questionnaires, text used for recruitment, and follow-up strategies. Future studies on Internet recruitment should focus on investigating ways to convey trust online to Internet users and to find attractive incentive structures for Internet users.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by grants from the Government of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (grant #416632) and from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (grant #452037).
