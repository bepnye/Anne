Therefore, Limberg flap and Mutaf techniques had a comparable early recurrence rate. Although Mutaf technique was associated with more frequent seroma formation, prolonged time to drain removal, and prolonged healing time, the 2 groups were similar in terms of early recurrence rate, wound site induration, wound dehiscence, hematoma formation, local sensory loss, and infection rate. Also, a lower VAS score at day 1 in Mutaf technique group was considered as an advantage. Therefore, we believe that Mutaf triangular closure technique may represent a viable surgical therapeutic alternative among off-midline approaches. This view should be supported with larger clinical samples involving the use of this technique in larger defects and involving longerterm follow-up.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
