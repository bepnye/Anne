Participants were marginally faster in completing the 16 survey questions when using pen entry (20/24 participants). The mean response time with the barcode scanner was 31 seconds longer than traditional pen entry for a subset of 16 questions (p = 0.001). The responsiveness of the scanning system, expressed as first scan success rate, was less than perfect, with approximately one-third of first scans requiring a rescan to successfully capture the data entry. The responsiveness of the system can be explained by a combination of factors such as the location of the scanning errors, the type of barcode used as an answer field in the paper version, and the optical characteristics of the barcode scanner.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5191" xml_f="5201" txt_i="1738" txt_f="1748">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5212" xml_f="5767" txt_i="1749" txt_f="2304">The results presented in this study offer insights regarding the feasibility, usability and effectiveness of using a barcode scanner with older adults as an electronic data entry method on a PDA.

Dedicated personnel generally administer survey instruments during interviews or have patients complete questionnaires. Although different approaches are used to gather the information (i.e. self-report, use of a proxy, interview), paper-and-pencil is still the most common method of data entry used by clinicians and researchers using self-report based health status questionnaires. Traditionally, information is converted into a format suitable for computerized quantitative data analysis, either by manual data entry (single or double key punching) or scanner technology. This can severely burden clinicians and researchers with unmanageable quantities of paperwork, compromise the accuracy of the information obtained, delay information processing and tranfer, and increase associated research and care management costs. Errors can also occur when completing the questionnaires at the point of data entry, transcribing the data for digitization to a computer database, or processing the information for tabulating scores and generating reports [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="7345" xml_f="7346" txt_i="3750" txt_f="3751">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7353" xml_f="7354" txt_i="3751" txt_f="3752">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7361" xml_f="7601" txt_i="3753" txt_f="3993">Electronic capture of PRO data (ePRO) from self-report health status questionnaires using computers is seen as a solution to these problems.

Among these platforms, pen entry on PDAs is the most widely used and tested method in medical fields. However, the usability of PDA devices with older adults in the context of data entry for self-report health outcome questionnaires has not been studied extensively. Usability is defined as the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specific goals effectively, efficiently, and with satisfaction in a specified context of use [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="8380" xml_f="8382" txt_i="4625" txt_f="4627">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8389" xml_f="8988" txt_i="4627" txt_f="5226">]. Usability is a multidimensional attribute used in the study of human-machine interaction to assess the ease with which a user can learn to operate, prepare inputs for, and interpret outputs of a system or component. PDAs have relatively small displays with limited resolution and data entry is accomplished primarily through the use of a stylus and touch screen. Because visual acuity, contrast-sensitivity function, and fine motor skills decrease with age, the usability of the user interface found in PDAs and the modes of data entry on these devices are not appropriate for most older adults [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="9020" xml_f="9022" txt_i="5226" txt_f="5228">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9029" xml_f="9498" txt_i="5228" txt_f="5697">]. They work relatively well in the hands of experienced able-bodied young people but often fail when one of these devices is given to an older adult with limited computer skills, poor eyesight, and imperfect hand-eye coordination or movement disorders.

A data entry input mask is a representation of answer fields that a user will activate through a specific action (i.e. checking a box corresponding to a given answer). Data entry input masks are linked to unique identifiers in a database stored on the mobile computer. Electronic forms can be a single questionnaire or multiple questionnaires as part of a library of health outcome measures. Information from health outcome questionnaires is presented on paper where each question and potential answer is assigned an 8-digit barcode. Upon successful scanning of a barcode for a given answer to a specific health outcome question, the answer field is activated on the data capture mask on the mobile computer data acquisition platform and the corresponding answer is read out loud on a speaker by the text-to-speech voice synthesizer. The system can be used by clinical personnel during interviews or by the patients themselves with relatively little training or supervision. After completion of the health outcome questionnaire, a report (scores or norm) can be generated and printed or transmitted by email to a third party, and the raw data transferred to a PC relational database.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="12329" xml_f="12355" txt_i="8259" txt_f="8285">Usability testing scenario</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12366" xml_f="13359" txt_i="8286" txt_f="9279">The usability of the barcode scanning system as a data entry method for self-report questionnaires was tested on 24 older adults recruited from the community.

Only 2 participants out of the 24 had a negative perception of the learnability of the barcode system (i.e. mean score lower than 60% indicating disagreement with statements; mean +/- SD score for the group was of 71% ± 12%). Results on the subjective satisfaction scale indicate that participants were comfortable with the system, did not find it too complex or cumbersome, and generally felt confident when using it. Mean scores on the subjective satisfaction scale after completing the first round of data entry using the barcode scanning system range from 44% to 85% with an mean +/- SD of 69% ± 7%. Only one subject had a negative perception on the subjective satisfaction scale. This was the same individual who had an unfavorable learnability score. Mean scores on statements comparing barcode entry to pen entry suggest that participants would not favor one data entry method over the other with respect to enjoyment, ease of use and effectiveness of completing an outcome questionnaire. Mean scores were distributed around the 60% mark and varied from 50% to 68% with an mean +/- SD of 62% ± 6%.

Usability issues when using PDAs as tools to collect information typically include screen size, handwriting recognition problems and data entry mechanisms [25]. An ePRO system combining barcode scanning with a voice synthesizer was developed and tested to address such difficulties. The concept behind the system is to use barcode scanning of answer fields from survey questions to input data electronically on a database residing on a PDA. The usability of a data entry system based on barcode scanning for electronic data capture of self-report health outcome questionnaires was evaluated in older adults living in the community.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32097" xml_f="32815" txt_i="23063" txt_f="23781">Participants were able to use the system to answer questions from an outcome questionnaire with limited instructions and no supervision. While the time to complete the survey questions using the barcode entry system was statistically longer than the time needed to complete the questions using pen entry, the difference can be considered marginal for real life applications, and is certainly offset by the time saved in avoiding the need for subsequent manual input of the data into a computer, which would likely be required when processing the pen entry data. Barcode scanner responsiveness was less than perfect, with approximately one-third of first scans requiring a rescan to successfully capture the data entry.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32822" xml_f="34482" txt_i="23782" txt_f="25442">The lack of responsiveness of the system can be explained by a combination of factors such as the location of the scanning errors, the type of barcode used as an answer field on the paper version, and the optical characteristics of the barcode scanner. A high percentage of first scan errors was located on answer fields on the far left of the paper, or more specifically for answer fields closest to the edge of the paper. Video analysis of first scan errors showed that unsuccessful scans were associated with starting the scanning motion too close to the printout of the barcode on the paper or putting too much pressure on the paper, thus slowing the scanning motion considerably. For barcodes to be scanned effectively, users must use a fluid motion from start to finish and start their scan at least one cm before the beginning of the barcode. The optical sensitivity of the barcode scanner in distinguishing blank space from space occupied by the barcode may therefore be a factor when considering ways to reduce first scan errors in future applications. Moreover, the precision of the positioning of the barcode scanner and the fluidity of the scanning motion were also affected by the hand dominance of the participants (92% righthanded). Answer fields positioned on the far left required more complex coordination of shoulder, elbow and wrist joints to position the barcode wand scanner and perform the scanning motion. However, it would seem that the need to use a second pass to successfully scan the chosen answer field did not have much impact on the time taken to complete the tasks and the participants' subjective satisfaction with the system.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34489" xml_f="35591" txt_i="25443" txt_f="26545">The results presented in this study offer insights regarding the feasibility, usability and effectiveness of using a barcode scanner with older adults as an electronic data entry method when completing patient-reported outcome questionnaires on a PDA. This was an exploratory study in a relatively small sample (n = 24) where the usability of a novel approach to data entry was assessed under conditions that approximated a real life clinical context. The sample size proved sufficient to identify barriers and obstacles that should be considered when designing and optimizing such a system for wide-scale use under the proposed specific application. Furthermore, while participants in this study found their experience with the barcode scanning system enjoyable and learned to become proficient in its use quite quickly, their educational background and generally positive attitudes toward technology could have introduced a positive bias in their evaluation of this device. In fact, the participants were highly educated and well above the average for adults, according to U.S. population statistics.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35598" xml_f="37585" txt_i="26546" txt_f="28533">When this study began, there were no commercially available systems designed specifically for the application we studied. A barcode scanning system with text-to-speech feedback combined with PDA technology was configured based on the consideration that such technologies could complement one another in providing greater flexibility and usability compared to paper-based systems or pen entry on a PDA when completing health status questionnaires. The barcode technology gets around the limitations associated with PDA screens and the use of a stylus. The flexibility of using a traditional paper-based medium to present information offers many possibilities for users to adapt such forms relatively easily using word processing and graphical software packages, as well as the ability to duplicate them on demand using a variety of print media. The paper layouts on which the barcodes are presented can be adapted to the user's characteristics (young, old, literacy, and linguistic backgrounds) or the context of use (interview or patient-entered information) through changes in the language of the text, graphical representation, color, or font size. The electronic data capture infrastructure programmed on the PDA is hard-coded but it is written in a way that allows the user to customize the method of data entry into the system. The use of paper versions and a data entry interface such as the barcode wand scanner make interactions between the ePRO system and the user more natural. The barcode wand scanner is similar in shape to a pen and can be easily manipulated with less dexterity than when writing with a pen. The use of a barcode scanner linked to a text-to-speech synthesizer provides dual feedback on both scanning success and accuracy of the item scanned. The features can be activated or not at the user's discretion and could also be used for communication purposes in people with cognitive difficulties or the inability to communicate quickly through the written word.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37607" xml_f="37617" txt_i="28535" txt_f="28545">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37628" xml_f="38764" txt_i="28546" txt_f="29682">The results presented in this study offer insights regarding the feasibility, usability and effectiveness of using a barcode scanner with older adults as an electronic data entry method on a PDA. With limited instruction and practice, participants successfully used the barcode scanner to answer survey questions from a self-report outcome questionnaire without assistance. While participants in this study found their experience with the barcode scanning system enjoyable and learned to become proficient in its use, the responsiveness of the system constitutes a barrier to wide-scale use of such a system. Optimizing the graphical presentation of the information on paper should significantly increase the system's responsiveness. Further testing on a larger sample is needed to address performance and reliability issues and ultimately compare the effectiveness of this method with other means of collecting information electronically from self-report health outcome questionnaires. Recent developments in pen-driven computing such as Tablet PCs (cost considerations aside) have provided fertile ground for new applications of ePRO.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38786" xml_f="38805" txt_i="29684" txt_f="29703">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38816" xml_f="38876" txt_i="29704" txt_f="29764">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38898" xml_f="38920" txt_i="29766" txt_f="29788">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38931" xml_f="39306" txt_i="29789" txt_f="30164">PB participated in the design and data collection of the study, performed the data analysis and drafted the manuscript.
