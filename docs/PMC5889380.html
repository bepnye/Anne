The students followed different approaches to work on each case depending on the experimental condition to which they had been randomly assigned. Under the self-explanation condition, students provided a diagnosis and a suitable pathophysiological explanation for the clinical findings whereas in the hypothetico-deduction condition students hypothesized about plausible diagnoses for signs and symptoms that were presented sequentially. One week later, all students diagnosed eight vignettes, four of which represented cardiovascular diseases. A mean diagnostic accuracy score (range: 0–1) was computed for the criterion cases.

Many schools now offer clinical reasoning courses early in the curriculum, but there is little empirical research on the approaches commonly used for the teaching of clinical reasoning. This experiment compared the effectiveness of two teaching approaches: self-explanation and hypothetico-deduction. The latter asks students to hypothesize about plausible diagnoses for clinical findings that are presented sequentially. Despite being very common, its effectiveness has rarely been investigated. The hypothetico-deduction approach worked slightly better than self-explanation to foster students’ diagnostic performance. Possible explanations for the findings are discussed.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title><offsets xml_i="11729" xml_f="11741" txt_i="2645" txt_f="2657">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11752" xml_f="12153" txt_i="2658" txt_f="3059">The acquisition of competence in the skill of diagnostic reasoning is perhaps the most important task a medical student is confronted with, a task that is fraught with difficulties.

In response to these developments, medical schools have begun to establish clinical reasoning courses earlier in the curriculum, during which students become acquainted with the art and science of diagnostic reasoning by practising with clinical problems. Early examples concern employing simulated patients for this task. More recent additions involve the use of high-fidelity virtual patients presented online. Both are however expensive to develop and execute and have uncertain advantages over paper vignettes [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6"><offsets xml_i="13654" xml_f="13655" txt_i="4327" txt_f="4328">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13662" xml_f="13664" txt_i="4328" txt_f="4330">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7"><offsets xml_i="13696" xml_f="13697" txt_i="4330" txt_f="4331">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13704" xml_f="13959" txt_i="4331" txt_f="4586">].

They distinguish between approaches on the basis of several dimensions, one of which is of interest for the present study: a distinction between cases unfolding in a sequential fashion (the ‘serial-cue’ approach) and ‘whole-case’ approaches. The basic difference between these two approaches is whether the case information is disclosed step-by-step or the entire case is available from the start. The former (‘serial-cue’) involves ‘hypothetico-deduction’, a way of reasoning resembling the diagnostic process of physicians [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8"><offsets xml_i="14560" xml_f="14561" txt_i="5116" txt_f="5117">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14568" xml_f="14977" txt_i="5117" txt_f="5526">]. Information about the patient only becomes sequentially available in the course of a student’s engagement with a case.

Subsequently, they were subdivided in groups of six, each with a facilitator who was a member of the academic staff. Prior to the study, the facilitators attended a 2-hour training session aimed at familiarising them with the study and ensuring uniformity of the procedure. The facilitator’s task was to take care that the procedure as described below was followed meticulously. He or she did not provide feedback or otherwise interfere with the learning.

The first three steps were taken individually. In step 4, students had to explain to each other how the signs and symptoms in the case were produced by the underlying pathophysiology. In step 5, they were to agree on a most likely diagnosis. After having reached an agreement, the next case was presented on screen. Students did not receive feedback.

When the core diagnosis was not given, but one component of the diagnosis was mentioned, the diagnosis was considered partially correct (e.g. ‘mitral insufficiency’ in a case of chronic mitral insufficiency with secondary heart failure). When the participant’s response did not fall into one of these categories, the diagnosis was considered incorrect. Three experts in internal medicine (G.A.C., M.M.M., and M.D.) independently evaluated participants’ responses for each case. Responses had been previously transcribed from the booklets to excel sheets so that evaluators were not aware of the experimental condition under which the diagnoses had been provided.

In addition, their control condition was not asked to process the cases sequentially, but to provide a best diagnosis based on the engagement with a whole case.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34565" xml_f="34647" txt_i="22839" txt_f="22921">A number of possible explanations for these divergent findings present themselves.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34654" xml_f="35212" txt_i="22922" txt_f="23480">First, some facilitators reported that students in the self-explanation groups had difficulty coming up with explanations incorporating mechanisms or principles underlying the signs and symptoms in the cases. It seemed that they had already forgotten much of the basic science they learned previously or had difficulty applying pathophysiology to actual clinical cases. This may be a reason that the self-explanation condition did not reach its full potential: it simply insufficiently activated relevant knowledge to strengthen the students’ knowledge base.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35219" xml_f="35725" txt_i="23481" txt_f="23987">Second, the hypothetico-deductive condition encouraged students to explicitly consider more than one hypothesis, while the self-explanation condition did not. Since the cases in the learning phase and the test phase were not identical, the chances are that those who were hypothesizing about possible diagnoses also considered one of more diagnoses that returned in the test phase, giving them a slight edge over the self-explanation group. On the other hand, in the studies by Chamberland and colleagues [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15"><offsets xml_i="35758" xml_f="35760" txt_i="23987" txt_f="23989">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35767" xml_f="35805" txt_i="23989" txt_f="24027">] and those of Mamede and colleagues [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20"><offsets xml_i="35838" xml_f="35840" txt_i="24027" txt_f="24029">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35847" xml_f="35849" txt_i="24029" txt_f="24031">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21"><offsets xml_i="35882" xml_f="35884" txt_i="24031" txt_f="24033">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35891" xml_f="36215" txt_i="24033" txt_f="24357">], the knowledge elicitation procedures excelled in particular with transfer cases, that is: cases that were in the same domain (for instance: cardiovascular disease) but had different diagnoses. To be fair, it has to be noted, however, that their studies did not include a comparison with a hypothetico-deduction condition.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36222" xml_f="36447" txt_i="24358" txt_f="24583">A third factor possibly favouring the hypothetico-deduction condition is that our experimental setup forced us to provide both groups with the same patient information, even if students in the hypothetico-deduction condition </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="36455" xml_f="36487" txt_i="24583" txt_f="24615">did not ask for that information</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="36496" xml_f="36930" txt_i="24615" txt_f="25049">. In real life, as in most educational settings, hypothetico-deduction is driven by the informational needs as seen by the doctor or student engaged in diagnosing a case. The problem-solver receives only the information he or she has asked for. Nendaz has demonstrated that, when doctors and students diagnose clinical vignettes using the hypothetico-deductive approach, they perform less well than groups who receive the whole case [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12"><offsets xml_i="36963" xml_f="36965" txt_i="25049" txt_f="25051">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36972" xml_f="37105" txt_i="25051" txt_f="25184">].

With mean scores around 0.20 on a scale between 0 and 1, our participants’ achievements were well under the achievements of students in similar studies [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20"><offsets xml_i="37387" xml_f="37389" txt_i="25427" txt_f="25429">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37396" xml_f="37398" txt_i="25429" txt_f="25431">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21"><offsets xml_i="37431" xml_f="37433" txt_i="25431" txt_f="25433">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37440" xml_f="37749" txt_i="25433" txt_f="25742">]. Again, this may indicate that our participants simply did not yet have sufficient knowledge to deal with the cases, and therefore those who produced, perhaps haphazardly, more different hypotheses during the learning phase, had a slight edge over those who did not. More research is clearly necessary here.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37756" xml_f="38296" txt_i="25743" txt_f="26283">It should be highlighted that many of these limitations can be seen as a side effect of our attempt at increasing ecological validity. We opted for comparing the two approaches under conditions that would closely simulate those encountered in an actual medical program: students worked in small groups with different facilitators. In doing so, we may have gained in validity, but strict control over the discussion in the groups was not possible. This comes as the unavoidable trade-off between ecological validity and experimental control.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38303" xml_f="38628" txt_i="26284" txt_f="26609">In conclusion, the much-used hypothetico-deductive method for teaching clinical reasoning did relatively well in our study. Tentative explanations have been raised but further research is required to explore which approach works better and under which conditions. New methods, such as self-explanation, need further scrutiny.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Institution to which the work should be attributed: College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University of Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Availability of data and materials</bold></p><p>Data are available for sharing upon request to the first author.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><sec id="FPar11"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank the following tutors of King Saud bin Abdulaziz University of Health Sciences for their contributions to the study: Saima Aamir, Hatouf Sukkarieh, Nosheen Mahmood, Amal Abdulrahim, Anum Yaqoob, Saima Ejaz, Suha Althubaiti, Mohammed Bargo, Mohammed Abdelrahim, Hisham Elaagip, Mohammed Eltoum, Amir Shouk, and Saleh Sayed.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><sec id="FPar12"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>A. Al Rumayyan, N. Ahmed, R. Al Subait, G. Al Ghamdi, M. Mohammed Mahzari, T. Awad Mohamed, J.I. Rotgans, M. Donmez, S. Mamede and H.G. Schmidt declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>ALQahtani</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Rotgans</surname><given-names>JI</given-names></name><name><surname>al Mamede Set</surname></name></person-group><article-title>Does Time Pressure Have a Negative Effect on Diagnostic Accuracy?</article-title><source>Acad Med</source><year>2016</year><volume>91</volume><fpage>710</fpage><lpage>716</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1097/ACM.0000000000001098</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26826069</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>HG</given-names></name><name><surname>Mamede</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Schuit</surname><given-names>SCE</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>Do patients’ disruptive behaviours influence a doctor’s diagnostic accuracy?
