Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive macitentan or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary clinical end point will be amputation-free survival rate at 12 months, defined as the time to major (above the ankle) amputation for the index (trial) limb or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, quality of life, in-hospital mortality and morbidity, repeat interventions, healing of tissue loss, and hemodynamic changes following revascularization. Sample size is estimated as 120 patients. The economic analysis will consist of two components: a “within-study” analysis, which will be based on study end points; and a “model-based” analysis, which will extrapolate and compare costs and effects likely to accrue beyond the study follow-up period.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4931" xml_f="4941" txt_i="1772" txt_f="1782">DISCUSSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4952" xml_f="5289" txt_i="1783" txt_f="2120">The REVASC trial is designed to be pragmatic and represents current practice of the real-world population management after limb revascularization for CLI due to atherosclerosis.

Briefly, FMAD is determined after visualization of the brachial artery using high-resolution Doppler ultrasound (12 MHz linear array transducer; Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) over the fold of the elbow in a longitudinal section, 60° transducer angle, with three measurements of the diameter between the intima–media interfaces. A pressure cuff above the transducer is inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes, and the brachial artery diameter is measured again at 60 seconds after its release. FMAD (%) is calculated by subtracting the mean of the baseline diameter from the mean of the postischemia diameter, divided by the mean baseline diameter, and is expressed as percentage. The coefficient of variation for FMAD in our laboratory is 7.3% ± 5.1%, as described previously, meeting the standardized method and variability measurement values recommended by AHA/American College of Cardiology.
