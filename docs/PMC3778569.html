The scoring method of the questionnaire in the knowledge part was 1 score for each correct answer and 0 for each wrong answer, and in the attitude part the score range of each question varied from 1 to 5, so that “completely disagree” scored 1, “disagree” 2, “I have no idea” 3, “agree” 4 and “completely agree” scored 5. In the practice part, given the practice and performance of the mother, correct practice was scored 1 and incorrect practice was scored 0. The scale scores of knowledge, attitude and practice were calculated out of 100. The inner practice guide questions about prevention of febrile seizure were calculated as frequency form. Assessment of the validity of the above-mentioned questionnaire was conducted through face and content validity; thus, the questionnaire was provided given reliable articles and sources and for assessment of content validity was given five experienced professors in various areas, and was reviewed by the researchers and a number of the views and comments applied in the questionnaire. In the previous stage, in order to assess the face validity, it was given to 10 mothers (homogenous and non-participated) and the explanations, questions and shortages inside the questionnaire were evaluated. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed on 25 mothers through internal consistency and Cronbach's alfa 70% was obtained in this regard. Two other identical health care centers (two selected centers as control and intervention group) were used in order to select mothers for implementation of reliability and validity of the questionnaire.
