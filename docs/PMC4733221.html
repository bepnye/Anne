We will recruit 3000 participants who meet the following eligibility criteria: 16-30 years of age, resident in the London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark, having at least one sexual partner in the last 12 months, having access to the Internet and willing to take an STI test. People unable to provide informed consent and unable to read and understand English (the websites will be in English) will be excluded. 
Baseline data will be collected at enrolment. This includes participant contact details, demographic data (date of birth, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation), and sexual health behaviors (last STI test, service used at last STI test and number of sexual partners in the last 12 months). 
Once enrolled, participants will be randomly allocated either (1) to an online STI testing and results service (Sexual Health 24) offering postal self-administered STI kits for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and HIV; results via text message (short message service, SMS), except positive results for HIV, which will be delivered by phone; and direct referrals to local clinics for treatment or (2) to a conventional sexual health information website with signposting to local clinic-based sexual health services. Participants will be free to use any other interventions or services during the trial period. 
At 6 weeks from randomization we will collect self-reported follow-up data on service use, STI tests and results, treatment prescribed, and acceptability of STI testing services. We will also collect objective data from participating STI testing services on uptake of STI testing, STI diagnoses and treatment. 
We hypothesise that uptake of STI testing and STI diagnoses will be higher in the intervention arm. Our hypothesis is based on the assumption that the intervention is less time-consuming, more convenient, more private, and incur less stigma and embarrassment than face-to-face STI testing pathways. 
The primary outcome measure is diagnosis of any STI at 6 weeks from randomization and our co-primary outcome is completion of any STI test at 6 weeks from randomization. We define completion of a test, as samples returned, processed, and results delivered to the intervention and/or clinic settings. We will use risk ratios to calculate the effect of the intervention on our primary outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. All analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title><offsets xml_i="10003" xml_f="10010" txt_i="3185" txt_f="3192">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10021" xml_f="10358" txt_i="3193" txt_f="3530">This study is funded by Guyâs and St Thomasâ Charity and it has received ethical approval from NRES Committee London-Camberwell St Giles (Ref 14/LO/1477).

There is a small risk that friends and partners may see participantsâ results if phones are shared. However, as in routine care, if participants are concerned about their privacy they can opt to receive their results via different methods (eg, via post). The intervention delivers the results via SMS text message (except in the case of a positive result for HIV, which is delivered via phone). However, this is made very clear on the website and participants can choose not to order an STI test kit online, if they are concerned about their privacy.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38948" xml_f="38980" txt_i="29573" txt_f="29605">Retention of Trial Documentation</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38991" xml_f="39043" txt_i="29606" txt_f="29658">We will retain the trial documentation for 10 years.</offsets></p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title><offsets xml_i="39096" xml_f="39103" txt_i="29662" txt_f="29669">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39114" xml_f="39239" txt_i="29670" txt_f="29795">By April 21, 2015, 1405 participants were randomized.
