This possibility is not supported by the neuroimaging data, assuming that striatal loss of dopamine-transporter binding is an accurate marker of PD-related nigrostriatal neurodegeneration and has the capacity to detect a meaningful group difference in change over 15 months. A concern is that patients with slow PD progression might have been over-represented among the PROUD participants, a consequence of the selection of patients deemed likely to tolerate a placebo phase of 6–9 months.

Mean response at week 72 did not differ between early and delayed starters at the higher dose of 2 mg per day.

This might imply that a floor effect for UPDRS rating of early PD might have masked a potential disease-modifying effect of rasagiline at the dose of 2 mg per day.

Excessive dropout of fast progressing patients from the placebo group might be expected to lead to a lower (ie, better) mean UPDRS score in those remaining and entering period 2. However, in PROUD, the two groups entering period 2 remained well matched, making this an unlikely explanation for the results noted.

disease (PD). On April 22, 2013, we searched in PubMed for reports of clinical trials, without restriction on language or on publication date, using the search terms “delayed-start” plus “Parkinson disease” or “Parkinson's disease”. We identified six reports: five concerning the Azilect Given Once-daily (ADAGIO)<xref rid="bib12 bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,19,20</sup></xref> or TVP-1012 in Early Monotherapy for PD Outpatients (TEMPO)<xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21,22</sup></xref> studies of the monoamine-oxidase inhibitor rasagiline, and one<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> presenting the rationale for the present study of pramipexole, a dopamine agonist. The Deprenyl and Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism (DATATOP) study<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> tested the ability of the monoamine-oxidase inhibitor selegiline with or without the antioxidant tocopherol to retard PD progression. Dopamine agonists have also been assessed for ability to slow the rate of progression of imaging parameters of dopamine metabolism or dopamine transporter density, compared with levodopa (Comparison of the Agonist Pramipexole versus Levodopa on Motor Complications of PD [CALM-PD]<xref rid="bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23,24</sup></xref> and Ropinirole as Early Therapy versus L-dopa Positron Emission Tomography [REAL-PET]<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> studies). All results of the published trials have been negative or inconclusive.</p><p><bold>Interpretation</bold></p><p>In a randomised delayed-start design study using 1·5 mg pramipexole during 6–9 or 15 months, we noted no difference in unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) total score between the early and delayed initiation groups. There was also no difference in dopamine transporter status by SPECT between the two groups at 15 months. These results indicate that pramipexole does not demonstrate an ability to slow progression of PD, as judged by UPDRS, over the 15-month period of the trial, and by contrast with the results of previous studies, does not indicate that earlier dopaminergic therapy is neuroprotective. Future clinical trials for neuroprotective drugs with symptomatic benefit will need to be designed with consideration for potential confounding factors (eg, biased PD sample, suboptimum PD stage for delaying neurodegeneration, inadequate study duration, masking by symptomatic effect, or suboptimum neuroimaging markers).</p></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
