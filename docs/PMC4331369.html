Social distance is the measure of how proximate a situation is to oneself and one’s own social group. For example, people exhibit closer social distance to themselves than to others, and they are closer to others in their social group than to those outside the group.

It seems that both the issue of outcome and feasibility places the focus on utilitarian reasoning, namely accomplishing a desired end. With deontic reasoning the focus is on the moral rightness or wrongness of specific features of the action. Thus, it is low CL oriented, but not primarily focused on feasibility. For example, in the trolley problem the feasibility of accomplishing the desired outcome is not in doubt, the problem is set up so that it is 100% feasible to switch the train to another track and save the people at the expense of killing fewer people. The moral issue, therefore, is not with feasibility versus outcome, it is with instrumental reasoning, i.e., feasibility and outcome versus non-instrumental reasoning, e.g., the intrinsic moral wrongness of intentionally causing innocents to die. Few studies have been conducted on the social distance of moral decision-making under the CLT framework.

The moral decision-maker faces the same gains and losses, i.e., one dies to save five, in each version of the problem, but the means by which those outcomes are achieved differ. The following situation is given in Thomson’s version of the trolley dilemma: A runaway trolley is heading for five railway workers. The driver can change the course of the trolley by pulling a switch that will redirect the trolley to another track where it will kill only one railway worker instead of five. The footbridge problem describes a variation on the same dilemma, i.e., the participant, as the agent, had a choice between pushing with his own hands a large person onto the tracks to stop the trolley from killing five people. Research participants are asked to judge the morality of action versus inaction for each of these dilemmas. Results indicated that while most people intuitively accepted that the switch should be pulled in the first scenario, most people considered that they, the agent, should not push the large man, although the consequences were the same: One person is killed to save five [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0117540.ref019" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18546" xml_f="18548" txt_i="10926" txt_f="10928">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18555" xml_f="19415" txt_i="10928" txt_f="11788">]. Most participants faced with the trolley dilemma made a decision consistent with utilitarianism, in that they emphasized the maximization of overall lives saved, rather than the avoidance of causing death. However, most participants did not agree with the “one for five” option in the footbridge problem. Their judgment was not consistent with utilitarianism (deontic judgment) that emphasized moral rights and obligations. Greene et al. have argued that what differentiates the trolley problem from the footbridge problem is that the former is an impersonal dilemma, because the impact on the victims is executed by a switch without personal contact. However, the latter is personal because the impact on the victim is generated by participant’s muscles. However, an interesting finding was the existence of utilitarian in participants for moral judgment [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0117540.ref016" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="19463" xml_f="19465" txt_i="11788" txt_f="11790">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19472" xml_f="19474" txt_i="11790" txt_f="11792">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19481" xml_f="19658" txt_i="11793" txt_f="11970">Christensen et al summarized that conceptual factors included personal force, benefit recipient, inevitability, and intention that have been shown to influence moral judgments [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0117540.ref021" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="19706" xml_f="19708" txt_i="11970" txt_f="11972">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19715" xml_f="20779" txt_i="11972" txt_f="13036">]. They further pointed out that a utilitarian response would be easier to motivate the participant, as more people would be saved by such a response. Different numbers of “saved individuals” used in moral dilemmas allow researchers to explore whether participants are sensitive to utilitarian/consequentialist considerations or not. We assumed that there is no basis for distinguishing between these two cases in Normative Ethical Theory (NLT). Therefore, we should consider the differences in judgments about them to be based purely on moral hypocrisy and CL biases. Thus, this study further distinguishes “saving individual”, making moral decisions for themselves or for others, and the dilemma problems and explore all three to ascertain how they effect people’s moral decision making. It would be helpful to know how CL variables affect the moral decision making. Moreover, it might help NLT researchers to separate the morally relevant differences between the cases. Further, this study explores how the moral decisions that people make are influenced by CL.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title><offsets xml_i="20848" xml_f="20854" txt_i="13039" txt_f="13045">Method</offsets></title><sec id="sec010"><title><offsets xml_i="20886" xml_f="20902" txt_i="13046" txt_f="13062">2.1 Participants</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20913" xml_f="21449" txt_i="13063" txt_f="13599">The participants were 768 male undergraduate students from three universities in China.

A six-point scale was used, instead of the more common seven-point scale, in order to require participants to express a preference for one action over the other by denying them a mid-point choice. Saving number, CL, and problem situation were the three independent variables, while the response of the participants to the decision making problem were the dependent variable.

This effect was observed because of the significant main effect of social distance and the interaction between social distance and the problem situation, but not of three factors. Whether the number of people to be saved was five or fifteen, social distance had less effect in personal dilemmas, and self-decision behavior or advice for others was consistent. In the footbridge problem, or impersonal situation, the number of individuals and social distance had a profound effect. Self-decision and advising others were significantly different, which indicates moral hypocrisy. In general, utilitarian considerations have more weight in impersonal dilemmas. Therefore, this study also provided new evidence for exploring the weight of utilitarianism in moral decision-making. Utilitarianism contends that consequences are the only reason for selecting the morally best option. However, Foot (1967) stated that according to utilitarianism [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0117540.ref033" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46088" xml_f="46090" txt_i="29120" txt_f="29122">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46097" xml_f="46610" txt_i="29122" txt_f="29635">], it can be a morally right action for a surgeon to transplant one person’s organs to five others for the reason of saving more people; this is an option that a strong majority rejects. In general, utilitarianism misses the morally relevant difference in different situations and the weight of non-utilitarian considerations. This study provided the most direct evidence of this difference. Another critique states that utilitarianism requires applying the same moral weight to the interests of self and others [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0117540.ref034" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46658" xml_f="46660" txt_i="29635" txt_f="29637">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46667" xml_f="46809" txt_i="29637" txt_f="29779">]: Our study did not support this view.

Thus, hypocrites assign different moral weights in judging for themselves than for others, while normal morality requires that we assign moral weights impartially across self and others. In the face of huge personal interests, cognition processes have enough flexibility to acquiesce to demands like those of coaches to athletes. And as we described in the introduction, they try every means to win when they are involved. However, when they become the audience, they require players to obey the rules of the game strictly. Utilitarian considerations are not absolute but limited by certain situational factors or the weight of moral. The situation can be likened to throwing a sprat to catch a herring: Athletes make utilitarian moral decisions and sacrifice their own opportunities to help teammates win. Self-decision and giving advice to others would become highly consistent because players would not break the moral bottom-line and act in an unfair manner, which would make the other players unable to play.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48990" xml_f="49767" txt_i="31618" txt_f="32395">Our study has a number of limitations. Its major shortcoming is that it adopted the moral dilemma paradigm. Thus, this study has many problems that are observed in morality studies. For example, decisions made in reality are not consistent with those that could be triggered by different dilemmas. In addition, a between-subject design involves confounding factors, such as personalities, families, and financial situations. Finally, this study attempted to investigate the cognitive mechanism of moral hypocrisy on the basis of CL, but the current study only connects to CL through inference, based on the assumptions of CLT, i.e., increasing social distance corresponds to higher CL. Future studies may explore more substantive factors in the reasoning process and mechanism.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0117540.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
