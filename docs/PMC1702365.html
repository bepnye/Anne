Upon arrival in the anaesthetic room, all patients had measurement of horizontal pupil diameter with a pair of callipers to within half a millimetre by a masked observer (who was the doctor administering the local anaesthetic). The same callipers were used throughout the study period. Callipers are precision instruments, easily obtainable and easy to use, which is why this method was used for assessment of pupil diameter. Subsequently, the doctor checked for the presence or absence of a wick in the inferior fornix and removed it with forceps if in situ. Pupil diameter and presence/absence of a wick were both recorded on the data sheet. Data on intra-operative and post-operative pupil diameters were not collected.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9047" xml_f="9054" txt_i="5214" txt_f="5221">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9065" xml_f="9200" txt_i="5222" txt_f="5357">There was no significant difference between the observed pupil sizes in the two groups of patients (Student's t-test: p = 0.255, Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="9232" xml_f="9233" txt_i="5357" txt_f="5358">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9240" xml_f="9254" txt_i="5358" txt_f="5368"> &amp; Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="9284" xml_f="9285" txt_i="5368" txt_f="5369">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9292" xml_f="9294" txt_i="5369" txt_f="5371">).</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label><offsets xml_i="9342" xml_f="9349" txt_i="5372" txt_f="5379">Table 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="9369" xml_f="9389" txt_i="5379" txt_f="5399">Pupil diameters (mm)</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9479" xml_f="9483" txt_i="5401" txt_f="5405">Mean</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9507" xml_f="9513" txt_i="5406" txt_f="5412">Median</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9537" xml_f="9555" txt_i="5413" txt_f="5431">Standard Deviation</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9579" xml_f="9598" txt_i="5432" txt_f="5451">No. of Patients (n)</offsets></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="9644" xml_f="9649" txt_i="5452" txt_f="5457">Wicks</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9673" xml_f="9678" txt_i="5458" txt_f="5463">8.198</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9702" xml_f="9703" txt_i="5464" txt_f="5465">8</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9727" xml_f="9732" txt_i="5466" txt_f="5471">1.213</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9756" xml_f="9758" txt_i="5472" txt_f="5474">53</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="9789" xml_f="9794" txt_i="5475" txt_f="5480">Drops</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9818" xml_f="9823" txt_i="5481" txt_f="5486">7.968</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9847" xml_f="9848" txt_i="5487" txt_f="5488">8</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9872" xml_f="9877" txt_i="5489" txt_f="5494">0.877</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="9901" xml_f="9903" txt_i="5495" txt_f="5497">57</offsets></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><offsets xml_i="9949" xml_f="9976" txt_i="5498" txt_f="5525">Statistical value p = 0.255</offsets></p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F1"><label><offsets xml_i="10048" xml_f="10056" txt_i="5526" txt_f="5534">Figure 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="10076" xml_f="10115" txt_i="5534" txt_f="5573">Graph of study results Pupil diameters.</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2415-6-36-1"></graphic></fig><p><offsets xml_i="10187" xml_f="10433" txt_i="5574" txt_f="5820">One wick was inadvertently left in situ by the doctor administering the local anaesthetic, and was subsequently removed by the surgeon in the operating theatre.
