However, the menace of postoperative pain still remains a major challenging issue for the attending anesthesiologist, especially during the first 24 h. The emerging role of the anesthesiologist as a perioperative physician further heightens the expectation for him/her to manage postoperative pain so as to enhance patient satisfaction and comfort during a hospital stay. For a long period, opioids have remained as gold standard drugs for analgesia during and after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, their use is also associated with undesirable, but established, side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, and pruritus. To minimize these side effects associated with the use of opioids, various methods have been adopted such as administration of nonopioid analgesics such as PCM.[</offsets><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7464" xml_f="7465" txt_i="3210" txt_f="3211">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7472" xml_f="7679" txt_i="3211" txt_f="3418">] Recently, newer studies have been published which have highlighted the possible role of intravenous (i.v.) dexmedetomidine in providing postoperative analgesia through the reduction of opioid consumption.[</offsets><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7712" xml_f="7713" txt_i="3418" txt_f="3419">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7720" xml_f="8389" txt_i="3419" txt_f="4088">] Although i.v. paracetamol (PCM) and i.v. dexmedetomidine have individually been studied to see their efficacy in reducing postoperative narcotic requirement and other side effects after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, only few studies have compared them with each other for the same purpose.
