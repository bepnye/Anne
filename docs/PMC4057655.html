In the meantime, welfare systems have developed a number of interventions with a view to reducing hospitalisation. Thus, control groups might be contaminated with other care services and consequently, effect sizes could be reduced. Burns et al. showed, in a systemic review including 29 trials, that the more ICM is adherent to the ACT model, the lower is duration of hospitalisation. Moreover, benefits regarding use of hospital care are more pronounced in patients with a high baseline level of hospitalisation. As new welfare systems generally aim at lower reliance on hospitals, use of hospital care at baseline is reduced in newer studies and consequently, significant reduction in costs for hospital care and also in total costs is more difficult to obtain. Thus, clinical benefits become more and more important to justify the implementation of ACT services [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="12404" xml_f="12405" txt_i="6571" txt_f="6572">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12412" xml_f="12414" txt_i="6572" txt_f="6574">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12421" xml_f="12995" txt_i="6575" txt_f="7149">In summary, there is very good evidence for the effectiveness of ACT compared to inpatient treatment and standard care, because it achieves better results in terms of reducing social impairments at comparable costs. However, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each community mental health care programme has to be evaluated in its special setting both in terms of real implementation and in terms of patients’ characteristics. Attention must be paid to unchanged costs not outweighing clinical and social benefits as in the end cost-effectiveness is what really counts.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="13011" xml_f="13066" txt_i="7150" txt_f="7205">The situation of mental health care services in Germany</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="13077" xml_f="13906" txt_i="7206" txt_f="8035">Germany is one of the countries with highest expenditure for mental health care in the world. However, in contrast to other western European countries, psychiatric treatment in Germany is still mainly provided by psychiatric hospitals, outpatient clinics and office based psychiatrists and only rarely by community mental health teams. As mental health policy, except the provision of pharmaceutical treatment, is the responsibility of the federal states, no national mental health plan exists. Therefore, community mental health care systems vary widely with regard to conceptual, organisational and economic conditions across the country. Moreover, the fact that different components of community mental health care are funded by different payers (and on different legal bases) hampers coordination and integration of services.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13913" xml_f="15141" txt_i="8036" txt_f="9264">Meanwhile an increasing number of experts suspect that the lack of national standards for community mental health care provision leads to deficits in service effectiveness and efficiency. As the only possibility to directly influence the design of community mental health care, the federal government, in recent years, has introduced several changes to the Social Security Code which forms the legal basis for health care financing. These legal changes allowed health insurance companies to enter into contracts with medical or non-medical mental health service providers for the financing of complex medical and psychosocial services for people with mental disorders which is a basic requirement for the provision of assertive community treatment. As a result of these legislative changes, some of the 146 German health insurance companies started to implement integrated mental health care services along the principles of ACT in collaboration with local mental health service providers. To date, there are only few systematic trials on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these integrated services. Only regional pilot projects have been evaluated and most of these studies are limited by methodological shortcomings.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15148" xml_f="15938" txt_i="9265" txt_f="10055">Within the framework of an analysis of a programme for integrated care (IC) of patients with schizophrenia developed on the basis of the ACT approach Karow et al. concluded that patients who were treated in the ACT programme showed a greater improvement in psychosocial and clinical outcome parameters after 12 months than patients in routine care.

In addition, the social code gives patients the right to be informed by sickness funds about the opportunity to enrol in an integrated care programme. If a patient fulfils the eligibility criteria, he or she will be informed by the health insurance and asked for the permission to transmit his or her contact data to the local integrated care provider. After the patient gives his or her permission to the sickness fund the local service provider contacts the patient and invites him or her to attend an informative meeting.

Research in real life conditions might be more difficult but it will pay off further effort when it comes to external validity of the results. Since the intervention will be delivered by the local integrated care providers in the regional community mental health setting, it can be expected that service provision varies in spite of the fact that the same basic service components have to be provided in each region. In addition, study regions vary with regard to available standard care services and general living circumstances. Furthermore, the study sample will reflect the full heterogeneity of patients with severe mental illness. This heterogeneity of the real world setting provides the opportunity to examine the impact of a broad range of individual and environmental characteristics on the outcome of mental health care.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41310" xml_f="41659" txt_i="33337" txt_f="33686">To make full use of this potential, high levels of academic rigour will be maintained by the involvement of independent, trained research associates and the application of standardised measurement tools, a strict monitoring and quality control for data collection and management and the application of advanced statistical methods for data analysis.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41666" xml_f="42266" txt_i="33687" txt_f="34287">The preference-based allocation of study participants might be the major target of criticism as it is suspected to introduce a selection bias. Preference-based allocation was mainly chosen due to the legal and organisational framework of NWpG contracts in Germany.

Selection bias will be controlled by means of propensity score adjustment.

Thus, historical data will not be up to date, and it is imperative to simultaneously examine changes in patients receiving standard care.
