In the case of patients with the IV line in another part of the body, the IV route was secured on the forearm vein. All patients underwent spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 10-15 mg via a 25-gauge Quincke needle inserted at the L3-4 or L4-5 interspace. The SBP and HR were monitored every 1 minute for the first 10 minutes and every 5 minute until the experiment was started. While monitoring the SBP and HR, the patients received 8 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate solution. None of the patients required a vasopressor agent because the SBP was reduced to &lt;80 mmHg before starting the experiment of the simulating IV test dose.

In addition, the heart rate was measured from the average of two R-R intervals collected from three consecutive values. The heart rate measured at 3 and 4 minutes were the values on the monitor. The SBP was measured every minute for 5 minutes. In addition, the subjective symptoms of the patients were divided into the symptoms of the central nervous system, such as dizziness, nervousness, and light-headedness and the symptoms of the cardiovascular system including palpitations, chest discomfort, and hot flushes.

However, the period of administering epinephrine in this experiment was shortened to 5 seconds and the T-wave amplitude was changed temporarily. Therefore, the change of T-wave amplitude may not be due to hypokalemia but to the stimulation of β-adrenaline receptors within the heart.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16594" xml_f="17217" txt_i="11702" txt_f="12322">There was one patient in the saline group and 2 patients in the lidocaine group who showed a ≥25% decrease of T-wave amplitude, which has not been reported. Normally, the T-wave amplitude is decreased by epinephrine and recovered along with a regular pattern. However, there were irregular patterns of the T-wave showed in 3 patients in each measuring moments. In the case when the amplitude of the T-wave is &lt;0.3 mV, it appears to decrease more than 25% even though it is only decreased slightly. Therefore, it is believed that the regular pattern of change will be more important than the size of the T-wave amplitude.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17224" xml_f="17567" txt_i="12323" txt_f="12663">There were some limitations in the index of the T-wave amplitude. It is difficult to measure the change in the T-wave size in the case of showing an abnormal T-wave or small T-wave. In addition, it can be difficult to evaluate visually because most of the normal T-waves are &lt;0.5 mV and the ECG can be altered by movement due to breathing [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="17598" xml_f="17599" txt_i="12663" txt_f="12664">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17606" xml_f="18010" txt_i="12664" txt_f="13068">]. Therefore, the T-wave needs to be observed by increasing the scale of ECG, and by printing and calculating the changes in ECG in order to apply the T-wave index. More study on the change in T-wave with monitoring instead of the printed ECG will be needed. In addition, unlike anesthesia in adults, the change in the T-wave of children is not useful as a marker for accidental intravascular injection [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="18041" xml_f="18042" txt_i="13068" txt_f="13069">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18049" xml_f="18051" txt_i="13069" txt_f="13071">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18058" xml_f="18822" txt_i="13072" txt_f="13833">Three and 4 patients in groups E5 and E10, respectively, complained of dizziness, nervousness, and light-headedness caused by the administration of epinephrine. Seven and 8 patients in groups E5 and E10, respectively, complained of palpitations, chest discomfort, and hot flush. In addition, 6 and 5 patients in groups E5 and E10, respectively, showed an increase in the maximum instantaneous heart rate by more than 100 bpm. In particular, there was one patient who had a &gt;130 bpm increase. There were 3 patients in group E10 who showed an increase in systolic blood pressure to more than 180 mmHg.

Therefore, the T-wave amplitude can be changed with &lt;5 µg of epinephrine used in the epidural test dose. However, it is believed that it will be difficult to apply in a clinical setting. It was assumed that the entire epidural test dose through the epidural catheter had been administered into blood vessels without any loss. However, it is unclear if the full epidural test dose is administered into blood vessel through an epidural catheter in a real situation. Like in this case, only epinephrine 5 µg as the epidural test dose cannot be sufficient to cause a change in the T-wave after the unintentional IV administration of epinephrine. Therefore, further studies will be needed to prove the efficacy of the T-wave amplitude in cases of &lt;5 µg of epinephrine because the decrease in T-wave size in this study was not proportional to the dose of epinephrine.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19803" xml_f="20093" txt_i="14796" txt_f="15086">In conclusion, the change in T-wave in spinal anesthesia may be clinically useful to detect an unintentional intravascular injection of low dose epinephrine containing an epidural test dose in CSEA.
