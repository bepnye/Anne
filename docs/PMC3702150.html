One of the stress sources for families is accidents leading to hospitalization particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU). In many cases, the families’ needs in patient care are not met that cause dissatisfaction. Since the nurses spend a lot of time with patients and their families, they are in a good position to assess their needs and perform appropriate interventions. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery ICU.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st2"><title><offsets xml_i="4409" xml_f="4431" txt_i="717" txt_f="739">Materials and Methods:</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4442" xml_f="4932" txt_i="740" txt_f="1230">This clinical trial was conducted in the neurosurgery ICU of Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran in 2010.

The statistical research community was the families of hospitalized patients in neurosurgery intensive care unit of Al-Zahra (SA) Hospital, Isfahan, Iran from May to September 2010. With respect to inclusion criteria, the families of 64 patients were selected with simple sampling. After obtaining the informed consents from the hospitalized patients, by using the envelopes, which were prepaid by using a table of random numbers, they were divided into two groups (intervention and control). The sample size for each group was calculated 32 patients. The inclusion criteria was included as the following cases: to be a first-degree member of the family, to be older than 18 years, willing to participate in the study, having the power to speak and write in Farsi, to be hospitalized one day before the study, lack of physical or mental problem in the family member, no responsibility for the care of another patient, introduced as the first person responsible for the patient care. Obtaining the written informed consent, completion of the questionnaires about demographic information and the families’ satisfaction were performed in the second day of hospitalization of the patients in ICU in both groups. Johnson questionnaire for the satisfaction of the family of ICU patients was used to measure the family satisfaction. The questionnaire was comprised of 14 questions. The rating of the questionnaire was performed by using the Likert scale with four options of 0 to 4 as follows: almost all the time (3 scores), often (2 scores), only occasionally (1 score) and never (zero score).

The interventions were performed in the second and the third day of hospitalization of the patient in the neurosurgery ICU by the researcher in the morning shift for the intervention group. Thus, the researcher provided understandable explanations about the disease to the patient’s family and answered honestly to the questions about the patient and the disease. The researcher ensured them for providing the best care in the section and spoke about the prognosis of the disease. The researcher took the family member to the patient’s room and gave the necessary information about the room space, equipment, personnel departments and the actions that were done for the patient. The researcher and the colleague were introduced as the contact. The patient family member was contacted if there was a change in the patient condition. The patient family was involved in the new decisions about the patient. The treatment was also described for the family. They were allowed to speak with the patient’s physician. They let the family help the patient in some cases of the public health (such as hand and foot massage and giving food). Locations of rest, nutrition, prayer room, bathroom and buffet of the hospital were introduced to them. The telephone numbers of hospitals and wards (and if necessary, the social worker and supervisor) were given. They also ensured that in their absence, everything would be sorted. Various departments and personnel of the hospital were taught to accept the families and communicate with them. The hospital social worker was introduced and if necessary, the patient’s family was allowed to express their feelings. These interventions were performed in the evening shift of the second and the third day of the patient reception. The actions were carried out by the fellow researcher. While, for the control group, only the routine work was done. On the fourth day, the satisfaction survey was completed by the selected family member in both of the intervention and control groups. Statistical methods used in this study were χ2 test, Man-Whitney, independent Student’s t-test and paired t-tests.

These interventions can be performed mainly by ICU nurses. They should be based on the family investigation and recognition and their priority needs should be determined in order to cause the greatest satisfaction. The ICU nurses must also accept their role in the care of patient’s family members. The findings of this study could be a basis for performing further studies about family needs of the patients in the ICU especially with the different forms of culture and economy. Consequently, the increase in family satisfaction of patients can reduce the stress disorders and improve their mental state and ultimately better support of the patient by the family. This study only examined the effect of nursing interventions in the first days of hospitalization on the satisfaction of the families but the effects on the patient’s entire hospitalization period has not been assessed. By performing other researches in this field, it would be possible to compare the differences in the effects of nursing interventions based on the needs of families in the early days and the whole period of the patient’s hospitalization.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENT</sc></title><p>This is to thank and appreciate the cooperation and assistance of all those who
