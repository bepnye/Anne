I think financial incentives would make a real difference... Today there’s no real reward ...nothing... zilch.” Participants noted that academic teaching and writing clinical guidelines necessitates continual learning and keeping up to date with the latest evidence (P#21): “I teach residents... I don’t want to be caught unprepared if a resident asks me about my opinion regarding a paper that was just published.”</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18360" xml_f="19439" txt_i="12870" txt_f="13949">Physicians recommended both personal and organizational strategies to overcome these barriers. Personal strategies consisted of constantly keeping up-to date (via medical journals and email services), meeting regularly with a colleague experienced in information retrieval and jointly searching for answers to clinical questions, leaving medication databases open during consultation, and using patient handouts. The main organizational strategies suggested include providing decision support services, assisting in “real time” decision making and decision support systems (P#23): “It would be very helpful if there was a support service I could call to ask questions... I wouldn’t feel like I’m imposing myself and taking up the specialist’s time”; (F#9): “There might be information overload using a decision support system, but it’s more realistic and less time consuming than looking for the information myself.” Other suggested strategies included: annual EBM knowledge exams and quality of care monitoring, regular staff meetings in primary care clinics, and journal clubs.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title><offsets xml_i="19472" xml_f="19550" txt_i="13951" txt_f="14029">The Effect of the Intervention on Attitudes, Perceived Knowledge, and Behavior</offsets></title><sec id="Sec11"><title><offsets xml_i="19581" xml_f="19631" txt_i="14030" txt_f="14080">Facilitators’ Perceptions of Changes in Themselves</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19642" xml_f="20752" txt_i="14081" txt_f="15191">Most facilitators found that teaching the course enhanced their own knowledge and skills; however, opinions differed regarding the impact on behavior. Some felt that their improved information retrieval skills influenced their ability to access EBM resources at the point of care (F#9): “Clinical questions that took me hours at night became 5-minute tasks done during the encounter. It’s a major difference.” But others noted the intervention had little impact on their ability to utilize pre-appraised resources and believed the intervention had missed the mark (F#5): “If the aim of the intervention was that while sitting with a patient I’ll be able to punch in a question and retrieve information within minutes, well we’ve failed. It just won’t happen”. Integrating EBM at the point of care was seen as more feasible through writing down clinical questions, and later, searching for them at home (F#3):“I can’t do much when the patient is present, but I’m able to write down questions which I later search for at home. At our subsequent meeting, I bring printed material and show it to them. This helps.”</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title><offsets xml_i="20785" xml_f="20837" txt_i="15193" txt_f="15245">Facilitators’ Perceptions of Changes in Participants</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20848" xml_f="21752" txt_i="15246" txt_f="16150">Facilitators believed the intervention affected their students’ attitudes, empowered them, improved their computer and EBM skills, but doubted the impact on their behavior (F#2): “Do I fantasize that the intervention influenced my students’ decision making? Unfortunately, no.” Others felt behavioral changes won’t be detected by examining (F#5) “test referral and drug prescription rates before and after the intervention,” but rather, by examining micro-changes (F#6):“ I taught them how to take text out of journal articles and paste it in their patients’ charts...These facets made EBM come to life in their daily practice.” A number of facilitators noted that the intervention’s effect depended on the initial knowledge of trainees (F#10): “The course really made a difference to those who had studied EBM in family medicine residency... Doctors lacking the baseline knowledge had a difficult time.”</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title><offsets xml_i="21785" xml_f="21835" txt_i="16152" txt_f="16202">Participants’ Perceptions of Changes in Themselves</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21846" xml_f="23106" txt_i="16203" txt_f="17463">In contrast to facilitators’ perceptions of trainees, most participants believed the intervention had an impact not only on their attitudes and skills, but on their behavior as well. Trainees claimed their ability to retrieve information improved and reported using EBM resources more frequently (P#23): “Before I used to search for medical information unsystematically. Today I’m more equipped to go online and know where to look for relevant information.” In addition, participants reported that the course affected their utilization of medication databases at the point of care. These databases were accessed to determine dosages, side effects, generic names, and drug interactions (P#25): “As a result of the course I use Micromedex a lot. It helps me when I need info on a new drug.” Participants also reported the intervention caused them to rely on (P#23) “online journal publications rather than outdated books” for clinical decision making. Although many physicians agreed that the intervention changed their behavior, some admitted that changes were mostly perceptual (P#21): “After the course I was really juiced up about the whole EBM idea... I’m constantly thinking about it; I’m in the process of starting... but I haven’t gotten down to it yet.”</offsets></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title><offsets xml_i="23151" xml_f="23161" txt_i="17467" txt_f="17477">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23172" xml_f="23485" txt_i="17478" txt_f="17791">To the best of our knowledge, no qualitative study has examined the perceived behavioral changes of PCPs participating in an EBM educational intervention.

While the intervention affected PCPs utilization of medication databases, it had little impact on the use of online EBM resources during consultation. Utilizing EBM resources at the point of care was perceived to be a complex task requiring clinical question formulation and relevant resource selection to reach a clinical decision. Even after a year-long intervention, most PCPs found this task to be virtually impossible. In contrast, utilizing medication databases during the patient–doctor encounter was perceived as easy to use, a simple task in which the benefits (rapidly determining dosages and drug interactions) well outweighed the impediments.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26431" xml_f="26876" txt_i="20358" txt_f="20803">Towards the final phase of the intervention, some facilitators anticipated that the intervention would not impact clinical behavior.

Although all physicians had access to online resources during consultation, they found tasks to be complex and the organizational barriers overwhelming. Tasks should be simplified by tailoring evidence-based information retrieval systems to the busy clinic, perhaps through integration with decision support systems. Moreover, strategies to overcome organizational constraints such as lack of consultation time, and lack of incentives should be employed. Finally, participants suggested establishing a decision support service facilitating EBM point of care integration and holding journal clubs during staff meetings. These suggestions should be considered.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28"><offsets xml_i="27767" xml_f="27769" txt_i="21655" txt_f="21657">28</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="27783" xml_f="28241" txt_i="21658" txt_f="22116">The study has a number of limitations.
