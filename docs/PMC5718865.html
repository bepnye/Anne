The intervention group received 30-minute perineal massage during second stage of labor. Subsequently, we analyzed perineal laceration, episiotomy, and perineal pain among the two groups. All of them were taught about postpartum perineal pain and its severity, and the researcher followed them up 3 days, 10 days, and 3 months after childbirth by telephone.

The study was explained to the women and they were included in the study if they were willing to participate. After informed consent was obtained the participants were randomly assigned to two groups: intervention (95 nulliparous women) and control (95 nulliparous women). Firstly, the researcher selected three expert midwives working in the childbirth unit of Be’sat Hospital as research assistants, and they were taught how to select participants, complete an inventory, and massage. They were then requested to massage with the presence of the researcher. In the second stage of labor (from the completion of cervical dilation to delivery), the research assistants massaged the perineum with a gentle up-down pressure toward rectum in a way that each part lasted one minute between 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions (U-shaped reciprocating motion) after wearing sterile gloves and lubricating their index and middle fingers with sterile lubricant (a colorless, odorless, and water-soluble substance called K – Y Jelly). The massage lasted 30 minutes, and the degree of downward pressure was determined according to mothers’ response, and if mothers expressed feelings of pain or burning, the pressure was reduced. If mothers withdrew from the study or had the exclusion criteria, massage was stopped, and they were excluded from the study. The control group received routine care. The research assistants were not involved in childbirth, and the childbirth was led by the midwife of the shift. The decision for performing episiotomy during childbirth in both groups was made regarding the diagnosed childbirth factor and indications of episiotomy. The perineum and vagina of the studied women were examined in terms of lacerations or episiotomy by the research assistants after childbirth, and the relevant papers were completed. All participants received postpartum routine care. All of them were taught about postpartum perineal pain and its severity, and the researcher followed them up 3 days, 10 days, and 3 months after childbirth by telephone. The data were collected using a questionnaire and through interviewing, examining women’s medical records, and observing. The first part of the questionnaire included demographic specifications, including age, educational level, occupation, history of abortion, and gestational age. The second part of the questionnaire involved information about the second stage of labor, episiotomy, degrees of perineal laceration, neonate’s birth weight and circumference of head and chest, Apgar score, and sex of neonate. The third part of the questionnaire was about postpartum complications and pain 3 days, 10 days, and 3 months after childbirth. First-degree perineal laceration refers to damages to the skin and mucous membrane of perineum; second-degree perineal laceration involves those parts in the first-degree laceration along with muscles; third-degree perineal laceration involves those parts in the second-degree laceration along with anal sphincter; fourth-degree perineal laceration involves those parts in the third-degree laceration along with rectal mucous membranes. The validity of the questionnaire was determined through examining content validity in a way that the questioner was confirmed by five faculty members of the Midwifery Department of the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences. Reliability of the questionnaire was determined through observers’ agreement method. To examine the postpartum pain, the participants were taught how to use a pain ruler and report it properly, and their phone number was recorded for arranging necessary follow-ups. The researcher called the participants 3 days, 10 days, and 3 months after childbirth and completed a checklist related to the record of severity of perineal pain, if any.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17397" xml_f="17410" txt_i="11495" txt_f="11508">2.4.

Attarha conducted a clinical trial to compare the effect of perineal massage using lavender essential oil with that of perineal massage alone on frequency of episiotomy and perineal laceration.

Results of that study showed the frequency of episiotomy as 8% in the group receiving perineal massage using lavender essential oil, 16.5% in the group receiving massage alone, and 80% in the group with no intervention, and the difference was statistically significant.

The difference in this regard was significant. These results conformed to those in the study of Attarha et al. in which the frequency of perineal laceration in the group receiving massage was higher than that in the control group, but severity of laceration in the case group was less than that in the control group, and lacerations in the case group were mostly of the first-degree type and as severe as a scratch that did not need repair (</offsets><xref rid="b17-epj-09-5588" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="25372" xml_f="25374" txt_i="18817" txt_f="18819">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25381" xml_f="25744" txt_i="18819" txt_f="19182">).
