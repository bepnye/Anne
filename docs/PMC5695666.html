In this paper we examine the relationship between: 1) PA and WL at 1 year (short-term WL), 2) PA and WL at 4 years (long-term WL), and 3) PA and WL maintenance between years 1 and 4. Specifically, we capitalize on the large number of individuals randomized to ILI who achieved ≥10% WL at Year 1 (n=235; 43% of sample) and examine whether there are differences in MVPA between those who maintain and do not maintain this magnitude of WL.

There are several potential explanations for this finding. First, the national PA guidelines were largely based upon self-reported PA and the current study assessed PA objectively. Given that self-reported PA is often higher than objective PA estimates it is possible that the magnitude of objectively-assessed PA that is optimal for WL maintenance may actually be lower than what has been recommended based upon self-report estimates. Second, it is possible that dietary intake, not PA was the primary driver of weight. While there is usually a strong correlation between adherence to physical activity and diet recommendations, it is likely that that those individuals engaging in lower than recommended levels of PA were maintaining their WL through greater adherence to the calorie restricted diet. However, dietary intake was assessed in a subset of participants in Look AHEAD that differed from the subset with accelerometry, making it difficult to examine this. Finally, given that this was an older population with more comorbidities, it is possible that using a 3 MET threshold may have failed to capture all activity done for the purpose of exercise or that some individuals lost weight or decreased PA over time as result of illness; thus reducing the association between MVPA and WL maintenance. Therefore, the generalizability of these findings may be limited to older adults with type 2 diabetes.</offsets></p><p id="P27"><offsets xml_i="30044" xml_f="30792" txt_i="22167" txt_f="22915">This study had numerous strengths including the objective measurement of PA, long-term follow-up data, and a large sample size. However, it is not without limitations. All analyses were post-hoc comparisons, examining the association between PA and weight change. Further, the direction of this relationship could not be determined – it is unclear whether WL led to increased PA or whether increased PA resulted in additional WL. Finally, although individuals included in these analyses were demographically similar to those without valid accelerometer data at all 3 time points, it is possible that these subgroups of individuals differed on other unmeasured parameters thereby limiting the generalizability of these findings to other populations.</offsets></p><p id="P28"><offsets xml_i="30808" xml_f="31490" txt_i="22916" txt_f="23598">In summary, these findings confirm previous reports regarding the importance of PA for weight control, with higher levels of PA associated with greater initial WL, long-term WL, and weight maintenance. However, within an older population with Type 2 diabetes, our data suggest that many individuals are able to achieve and maintain clinically significant long-term WL while engaging in less than the recommended level of MVPA for WL maintenance. Future studies should examine how those who maintain WL with high PA differ in other weight control behaviors (e.g., dietary intake) or cardiometabolic risk profiles compared to those maintaining clinically significant WL with lower PA.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><p>This study would not have been possible without the contributions of the entire Look AHEAD Research Group (See online S1).</p><p><bold>Funding and Support:</bold></p><p>Additional support was received from The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Bayview General Clinical Research Center (M01RR02719); the Massachusetts General Hospital Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Clinical Research Center (M01RR01066); the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center (RR025758-04); the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center General Clinical Research Center (M01RR00051) and Clinical Nutrition Research Unit (P30 DK48520); the University of Tennessee at Memphis General Clinical Research Center (M01RR0021140); the University of Pittsburgh General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) (M01RR000056), the Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) funded by the Clinical &amp; Translational Science Award (UL1 RR 024153) and NIH grant (DK 046204); the VA Puget Sound Health Care System Medical Research Service, Department of Veterans Affairs; and the Frederic C.
