The basic diagnostic method of myofascial pain syndrome is determined by physical examination such as localized muscle tenderness, typical referred pain, palpable intramuscular taut band, muscular twitching response along with subjective symptoms of the patients. In addition, method of assessment of pain threshold using algometry can be helpful in diagnosing myofascial pain syndrome. As the methods of treatment for myofascial pain syndrome, stretching, dry-needling and trigger point injection using diverse range of drugs are used along with generally practiced physical therapy.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="7456" xml_f="7457" txt_i="2971" txt_f="2972">1</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="7471" xml_f="8235" txt_i="2973" txt_f="3737">Recently, application of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) has been expanded as one of the treatment methods for the diseases of musculoskeletal system.

Prior to execution of Repeated Measure ANOVA, Sphericity test of Mauchly for measurement of homoscedasticity and compound symmetry was performed. In the case of satisfaction of the sphericity assumption (p&gt;0.05), verification of time effect (Time) and reciprocal action effect (Group×Time) were analyzed by using sphericity assumption statistics of Univariate test. If sphericity assumption was not satisfied (p&lt;0.05), statistics of Wilks' Lambda in Multivariate test was used. Moreover, Fisher's exact test of small specimen was carried out for verification of the results of Roles and Maudsley score and final response assessment.

There are 3 methods of generating focused-type shock wave, namely, piezoelectric, electromagnetic and electrohydraulic methods. Shock wave is generated by using the principle in which electricity is converted into shock wave through quick physical movement of electricity in a liquid medium. Each of the equipment uses charged condenser with different voltage from each other, and conversion into shock wave is achieved as electricity becomes rapidly discharged in acoustic transducer.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="20611" xml_f="20612" txt_i="15185" txt_f="15186">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20619" xml_f="20753" txt_i="15186" txt_f="15320"> ESWT can be classified in accordance with the level of energy flux density (EFD) into as low energy with EFD range of 0.08-0.27 mJ/mm</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="20758" xml_f="20759" txt_i="15320" txt_f="15321">2</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="20765" xml_f="20820" txt_i="15321" txt_f="15376">, intermediate energy with EFD range of 0.28-0.59 mJ/mm</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="20825" xml_f="20826" txt_i="15376" txt_f="15377">2</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="20832" xml_f="20881" txt_i="15377" txt_f="15426">, and high energy with EFD of more than 0.6 mJ/mm</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="20886" xml_f="20887" txt_i="15426" txt_f="15427">2</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="20893" xml_f="21000" txt_i="15427" txt_f="15534">.
