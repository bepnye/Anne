The aim of our study was to investigate whether, for how long and to what extent a training program for visual functions could improve visual search. The study involved 24 healthy students from the Szczecin University who were divided into two groups: experimental (12) and control (12). In addition to regular sports and recreational activities of the curriculum, the subjects of the experimental group also participated in 8-week long training with visual functions, 3 times a week for 45 min. The Signal Test of the Vienna Test System was performed four times: before entering the study, after first 4 weeks of the experiment, immediately after its completion and 4 weeks after the study terminated. The results of this experiment proved that an 8-week long perceptual training program significantly differentiated the plot of visual detecting time. For the visual detecting time changes, the first factor, Group, was significant as a main effect (F(1,22)=6.49, p&lt;0.05) as well as the second factor, Training (F(3,66)=5.06, p&lt;0.01). The interaction between the two factors (Group vs. Training) of perceptual training was F(3,66)=6.82 (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, for the number of correct reactions, there was a main effect of a Group factor (F(1,22)=23.40, p&lt;0.001), a main effect of a Training factor (F(3,66)=11.60, p&lt;0.001) and a significant interaction between factors (Group vs. Training) (F(3,66)=10.33, p&lt;0.001). Our study suggests that 8-week training of visual functions can improve visual search performance.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sports vision</kwd><kwd>training</kwd><kwd>eye movements</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title><offsets xml_i="5929" xml_f="5941" txt_i="1692" txt_f="1704">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5952" xml_f="6535" txt_i="1705" txt_f="2288">One of the essential components of the perceptual mechanism in visual information processing is the ability to effectively search in order to locate a specific object among many others.

The quality of the pursuit and saccadic eye movements in athletes is an essential aspect of many sport tasks.

In order to keep the eye at a given position, a static force has to be produced by all the muscles involved. An adequate level of strength is needed to counteract the work of all the other muscles. Moving the eyes from one eccentric position to the other requires a dynamic force which overcomes resistance of the muscles. This enables the eye to produce a movement. While a static force must exist when the eye is stationary, a dynamic force must only be used during a real movement of the eye.
