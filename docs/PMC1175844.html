These two conditions are common and there is very good evidence about how to best prevent morbidity and mortality – and good evidence that quality of care is, in general, suboptimal. Practice audits have demonstrated that about one-half of eligible HF patients are prescribed ACE inhibitors (with fewer still reaching appropriate target doses) and less than one-third of patients with established IHD are prescribed statins (with many fewer reaching recommended cholesterol targets). It is apparent that interventions to improve quality of prescribing are urgently needed. We hypothesized that an intervention that consisted of patient-specific one-page evidence summaries, generated and then endorsed by local opinion leaders, would be able to change prescribing practices of community-based primary care physicians.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4248" xml_f="4270" txt_i="1148" txt_f="1170">Methods (study design)</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4281" xml_f="5000" txt_i="1171" txt_f="1890">A pragmatic single-centre cluster randomized controlled trial comparing an opinion leader-based intervention to usual care for patients with HF or IHD.

All 5 nominated opinion leaders participated in the development of the intervention materials.
