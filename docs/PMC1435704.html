While using zip codes to assess the intervention effects may be a methodological limitation, many churches do not release individual-level parish membership data, as it is potentially damaging to the trusting relationship required to implement this intervention. According to the Archdiocese of Denver's Hispanic Ministry, a large proportion of Latinos attend their neighborhood church (i.e., in the same zip code) because of a recent increase in the number of churches offering masses in Spanish.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="15309" xml_f="15334" txt_i="11266" txt_f="11291">Mammogram screening rates</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="15345" xml_f="15698" txt_i="11292" txt_f="11645">Mammogram claims obtained from Medicaid fee-for-service administrative data were used for the analysis.
