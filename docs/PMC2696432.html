Firstly, the introduction of new games to participants was staggered to maintain interest and motivation (games were given at baseline and again at 12 weeks).

The focus groups gave insight into the video game preferences of children; in particular, it was identified that older children preferred traditional non-active gaming, and thus were unlikely to be complaint to an active video games intervention. The researchers therefore tailored the intervention to an appropriate age group (10–14 years) for the main trial. Also, parents generally supported the concept of active video gaming, and would therefore be more likely to promote home use of the games. The energy expenditure study provided information specific to the gaming system of interest (Sony EyeToy™), gave insight into whether the active games were sufficiently vigorous such that they could be used as a physical activity intervention, and gave an indication of how much game play may be used to cause an appreciable change in body composition.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35806" xml_f="36842" txt_i="27637" txt_f="28673">The pilot RCT identified a myriad of issues relevant to the design and conduct of the main trial. Potential compliance problems were identified; the effect of the intervention decreased from six to 12 weeks, which raised issues of sustained interest in the intervention. For this reason, the introduction of new games was staggered throughout the intervention in the main trial to maintain interest. The pilot RCT also allowed the researchers the opportunity to develop and test the study materials and protocols on a small scale prior to the main trial. In particular, issues relating to management of the accelerometer data were resolved, such as the appropriate epoch and data reduction protocols, and systems put in place for the management of larger amounts of data. A new snack log was developed that was more appropriate to the age group than the instrument used in the pilot trial. Feasibility of recruitment processes was tested; recruitment was 100% for all three phases, with good representation by Māori and Pacific peoples.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="36864" xml_f="36906" txt_i="28675" txt_f="28717">Developing a relationship with a corporate</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36917" xml_f="37431" txt_i="28718" txt_f="29232">Working relationships were developed with SCEE and SCENZ.

Therefore, developing and maintaining an effective working relationship with schools is crucial to the success of the project. The participation of schools in research is voluntary and in the past has often involved significant disruption to the school timetable and the requirement of staff time to help co-ordinate data collection. Furthermore, there is no common method to approach schools, which has resulted in school principals fielding scores of requests from researchers weekly. This has resulted in a somewhat strained relationship between schools and the academic community and an increasing reluctance for schools to be involved in research. The eGAME recruitment strategy sought to minimize disruption to school processes. With the principal's permission, a 5–10 minute presentation was scheduled during a regular school assembly slot. In this presentation, a brief outline of the study was given and interested students wrote their contact details on forms distributed to classes. Approximately seven days later, these forms were collected from the school. Potential participants and their parents were then contacted outside of school hours for screening. All assessments took place in the evening or weekend so as not to disrupt school attendance. Researchers seeking to undertake research with school involvement should aim to minimize the use of school time and resources where possible. Furthermore, researchers should keep schools up to date with relevant information and the results of the trial once completed.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39115" xml_f="39172" txt_i="30866" txt_f="30923">Recruitment of indigenous and ethnic minority populations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39183" xml_f="39536" txt_i="30924" txt_f="31277">Researchers have typically struggled to recruit sufficient participants from indigenous and ethnic minority populations to allow for sub-analyses to be undertaken by ethnicity.

A specialized Māori/Pacific recruiter was contracted to assist with recruitment of these populations and consult on cultural issues relevant to the conduct of the research. As a result, additional recruitment sites were set up in the greater Auckland area where a large number of Māori and Pacific resided, to improve access of these populations to the study. Furthermore, some study processes were modified to improve cultural appropriateness. For example, at one study site the screening phone call was changed to a face-to-face visit between study staff and the potential participant and their family, the preferred mode of communication for Māori and Pacific populations. The Māori/Pacific recruiter maintained regular contact with participants throughout the course of their involvement with study. Despite these steps, recruitment of Māori and Pacific children remains a challenge. At the time of submission of this manuscript, the eGAME sample comprised 17% Māori and 27% Pacific participants, below the target of 33% for each.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="40725" xml_f="40793" txt_i="32440" txt_f="32508">Potential to encourage less healthy behaviors and increase disparity</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40804" xml_f="41219" txt_i="32509" txt_f="32924">During the conceptualization of the study, there was particular concern that the intervention would act to promote additional video game play in participants, including heightened use of traditional sedentary games.

In the eGAME trial, intervention participants were instructed to substitute the time spent playing non-active video games with active games, rather than increase their overall video game play. Furthermore, participants were required to already be owners and regular users of video game console technology to be eligible for the study, so that video game use was not promoted in those who did not currently own them. Researchers were sensitive to the potential that the video console ownership criteria could increase disparities, as ownership may differ by ethnic group. However, market research statistics indicated this was not the case; video game console ownership in 2005 was higher among Māori (46%) than non-Māori (31%–44%) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52"><offsets xml_i="42027" xml_f="42029" txt_i="33661" txt_f="33663">52</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42036" xml_f="42038" txt_i="33663" txt_f="33665">].</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="42060" xml_f="42098" txt_i="33667" txt_f="33705">Methodology issues in pragmatic trials</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42109" xml_f="42269" txt_i="33706" txt_f="33866">The eGAME study is an example of a pragmatic trial, in which the study is designed to maximize the applicability of the trial's results to usual care settings [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53"><offsets xml_i="42301" xml_f="42303" txt_i="33866" txt_f="33868">53</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42310" xml_f="42483" txt_i="33868" txt_f="34041">].

Furthermore, the context of the trial is the participant's own home environment where video game use tends to occur. Participants in the intervention group were asked to report on their game play, though this was not directly observed. Therefore, control of the intervention was not stringent and the implementation of the intervention was slightly different for each participant with regards to frequency and duration of play. Nevertheless, this will provide researchers with an indication of the usefulness of this intervention in a naturalistic setting, and frequency and duration of self-directed play are important outcomes in themselves.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="43273" xml_f="43304" txt_i="34805" txt_f="34836">Implications for future studies</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="43315" xml_f="44246" txt_i="34837" txt_f="35768">Investigation into the feasibility of the proposed intervention, as well as robust testing of proposed study procedures is a critical step prior to implementation of a large-scale trial. These preliminary steps will likely enhance intervention effectiveness, identify potential issues specific to the context of the research, and help to ensure sufficient numbers of participants are able to be recruited to detect an effect. Partnering with industry can be mutually beneficial, though researchers must remain vigilant to potential conflicts of interest and be transparent as to where the involvement of the commercial partner lies. Results of the eGAME study are due in early 2010, and will be disseminated to relevant community and government organizations, as well as being published in academic journals. In the meantime, it is hoped that the issues discussed provide guidance to those undertaking similar trials with children.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44274" xml_f="44293" txt_i="35771" txt_f="35790">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44304" xml_f="44437" txt_i="35791" txt_f="35924">The relationship between the authors and SCEE and SCENZ has been outlined.
