Intervention patients were recruited between April and November 2011 to undertake a 3-month programme using Florence. Patients could continue using Florence after this period if they so desired and at the discretion of the practice. Data collection continued for 6 months from recruitment.

Patients obtained their BP readings and texted the results to a secure server, ‘Florence’. Florence is an interactive service, which reminds patients to text their BP readings each day, and sends reminders if a reading is not received within 2 h. It also sends automatic responses to patients regarding any further required actions based upon the BP readings obtained, from sending a repeat reading if the programme detects that an error may have occurred, through advising patients to contact their doctor or practice nurse. This allows for ‘closed loop’ monitoring with weekly, or more frequent, review by the patient's own general practitioner (GP)/nurse who can log into the secure server and access their results. Messages can be sent back to the patient from their primary healthcare team with advice on continuing management. Although Florence had not been used in this context prior to this project, local pilot use for other conditions resulted in positive anecdotal reports from patients and professionals.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13848" xml_f="14172" txt_i="8360" txt_f="8684">One member of the practice team, usually a practice nurse, led the telehealth programme in each practice.

This baseline data allowed calculations of change in BP control as well as comparison between the intervention and control patients at baseline and end of the evaluation. Practices were then asked to complete a proforma which asked for information about BP readings, eGFR, medications, comorbidities and healthcare service use every 2 months for intervention patients for a total of 6 months. Due to administrative burden, data collection occurred every 3 months for control patients. No specific tests of eGFR were organised purely for the sake of this evaluation. Therefore, eGFR results were only available if the practice had initiated this test as part of usual care.

For one of these patients additional antihypertensive medication was started at the hypertension review by the practice but the BP reading is not provided.

Feedback from staff and patients implied that intervention patients were often those who, due to personal, family, occupational or unknown factors, had been previously difficult to engage or control. This is also indicated by the significantly greater BP readings at baseline and 1 year prior to baseline among intervention patients compared with control patients (see </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001391TB2"><offsets xml_i="52372" xml_f="52379" txt_i="31053" txt_f="31060">table 2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="52386" xml_f="52692" txt_i="31060" txt_f="31366">).

This demonstrated similar outcomes to the current service evaluation, that intervention patients had significantly greater reductions in their BP at 6 months from a higher baseline BP. However, they demonstrated that the difference between intervention and control patients was not sustained at 1 year. Therefore, to determine if the benefits of using Florence identified in this evaluation are prolonged, a longer period of follow-up is needed that can also track the use of healthcare resources.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="53422" xml_f="53643" txt_i="32028" txt_f="32249">Healthcare professional concerns, detected in a previous UK study investigating the acceptability of the concept of monitoring of BP using mobile phones, which related to inconvenience of ‘continuous streams of readings,’</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><offsets xml_i="53675" xml_f="53677" txt_i="32249" txt_f="32251">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="53684" xml_f="54026" txt_i="32251" txt_f="32593"> were addressed by the current programme which was designed to take no longer than 1 min a week per patient for a health professional to review the BP results.

Therefore, if patients had not taken multiple readings or used a different arm at different times, the recorded BPs may not have been accurate.

The benefit of rolling this type of intervention out more widely to tackle hypertension in the primary care community could be great, provided patients are carefully counselled regarding what it involves and to ensure that they have the physical and cognitive ability to undertake BP readings and send text messages, or that they have regular contact with someone who is willing to do this on their behalf.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="55573" xml_f="56288" txt_i="34066" txt_f="34778">To maximise reductions in BP, careful selection of patients onto a simple telehealthcare programme (eg, patients without CKD stages 3–5 who are hypertensive &gt;140/90 mm Hg) is required. However, anecdotal evidence obtained through the associated qualitative data indicates that less quantifiable benefits can be gained from recruiting patients with uncertain diagnoses of hypertension and/or suspected white-coat hypertension. Although there was no evidence of Florence helping to detect patients who were being over treated due to white-coat hypertension in this case, a systematic review of RCTs has found that home BP monitoring can result in down titration of hypertensive medication compared with usual care.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><offsets xml_i="56320" xml_f="56322" txt_i="34778" txt_f="34780">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="56329" xml_f="56732" txt_i="34780" txt_f="35183"> Therefore, a broader application of this type of intervention may be considered.

However, the impact of reducing BP on these factors is likely to be delayed by some months or years while the costs of reducing the BP (using simple telehealth system (system itself and appointments used training patients to use the system) and increased changes to medication) are realised now. Therefore, to undertake a thorough economic evaluation of an intervention such as and to determine the long-term benefits of this strategy requires follow-up of at least a year.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="57424" xml_f="57446" txt_i="35815" txt_f="35837">Supplementary Material</offsets></title><supplementary-material id="d34e136" content-type="local-data"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="57533" xml_f="57552" txt_i="35838" txt_f="35857">Author's manuscript</offsets></title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001391.draft_revisions.pdf"></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e137" content-type="local-data"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="57784" xml_f="57801" txt_i="35858" txt_f="35875">Reviewer comments</offsets></title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001391.reviewer_comments.pdf"></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank  John Blackburn, Chris Chambers, James Davies, Mike Dixon, Dave Sanzeri, Diane Wilshaw who work for NHS Stoke on Trent CCG and were part of the programme steering group and/or data collection team.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributor:</bold> EC designed data collection tools, inputted and analysed data and drafted and revised the original paper.
