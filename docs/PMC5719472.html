The primary aims of the programme are to promote better understanding and acceptance of developmental disorders and developmental delays and help parents apply skills that promote child development, communication and functioning. The secondary aims of the programme include strengthening caregivers’ coping skills and psychological well-being, and promoting child adaptive behaviours.
