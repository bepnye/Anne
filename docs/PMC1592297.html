The SPC assessment moves away from an approach focused primarily on treatment difference in PASI 75 response in isolation, to an approach that would further characterize each patient's response to treatment, leading to a better understanding of the benefit:risk that should be expected in psoriasis treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15345" xml_f="15948" txt_i="11105" txt_f="11708">Using conventional, uni-dimensional assessment measures such as PASI 75 and DLQI, efalizumab has already been demonstrated to be significantly more effective than placebo. However, the use of these physician- or patient-assessed scales either alone, or independently of each other, does not accurately demonstrate the multidimensional effect that efalizumab has in safely controlling psoriasis. Studies indicate that there is a need to consider psoriasis and its treatment not just in terms of objective assessments of lesion severity, but also in terms of the impact of the disease on patients' lives [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="15980" xml_f="15982" txt_i="11708" txt_f="11710">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15989" xml_f="15990" txt_i="11710" txt_f="11711">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"><offsets xml_i="16022" xml_f="16024" txt_i="11711" txt_f="11713">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16031" xml_f="16240" txt_i="11713" txt_f="11922">]. The inclusion of the safety component in the SPC endpoint allows a simple benefit:risk assessment to be made, as the endpoint describes the proportion of patients who had benefit without major side effects.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16247" xml_f="16552" txt_i="11923" txt_f="12228">We applied this new outcome measure â SPC â using week 12 data obtained from studies that had already been completed and analyzed using conventional uni-dimensional measures such as PASI, and evaluated SPC prospectively in a new study (IMP 24011) that had not been completed at the time SPC was described.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16559" xml_f="17282" txt_i="12229" txt_f="12952">A favorable overall benefit:risk profile as determined by the SPC endpoint was confirmed in nearly 40% of all the patients treated with efalizumab for 12 weeks. Using SPC in both prospective and retrospective clinical trial analyses, efalizumab consistently demonstrated superiority over placebo, demonstrating that many patients achieve disease control without major safety issues, and at the same time experience an improved quality of life. Importantly, efalizumab was similarly effective in high-need patients. Also, even amongst those patients who did not manage to achieve SPC, approximately 9% achieved PASI 75 after 12 weeks of treatment with efalizumab 1.0 mg/kg, compared with less than 1% of patients on placebo.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17289" xml_f="18224" txt_i="12953" txt_f="13888">Improvement in the management of psoriasis is particularly welcome as the impact of the disease, particularly among high-need patients, and shortcomings of current treatments are becoming more widely recognized. Current management of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis involves systemic therapies, such as cyclosporin, methotrexate, acitretin and PUVA, which are associated with treatment-limiting systemic cumulative toxicities. The use of biological agents such as efalizumab that modulate the activation of T-cells and their migration into the dermal and epidermal tissues may provide more targeted therapy with an improved safety profile. Our findings, and those of prior trials of efalizumab, support this concept and demonstrate promising opportunities to improve therapy. The observations of substantial disease improvements with little evidence of systemic toxicity are consistent with those in previous reports.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18231" xml_f="18701" txt_i="13889" txt_f="14359">The endpoints used in trials should align with the treatment goals of clinical practice. SPC includes all relevant assessments (physician, patient, and safety) and is a more robust way of estimating the true benefit:risk ratio of psoriasis treatment. The findings of this analysis using the SPC show that efalizumab provides significant improvements safely in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and particularly in difficult-to-treat, high-need patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18723" xml_f="18742" txt_i="14361" txt_f="14380">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18753" xml_f="18797" txt_i="14381" txt_f="14425">Kim Papp has acted as a consultant to Serono</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18804" xml_f="18843" txt_i="14426" txt_f="14465">Eric Henninger is an employee of Serono</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18850" xml_f="18925" txt_i="14466" txt_f="14541">*** This material was presented as a poster during the EADV 2004 convention</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18947" xml_f="18969" txt_i="14543" txt_f="14565">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18980" xml_f="19204" txt_i="14566" txt_f="14790">Both KP and EH developed and applied the Safe Psoriasis Control approach to efalizumab clinical trial data.
