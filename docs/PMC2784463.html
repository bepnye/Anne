However, although alcohol misuse is common amongst offenders, there is limited evidence of alcohol brief interventions in the criminal justice field.

Randomisation will be stratified by probation area. To test the relative effectiveness of different screening methods all OMs will be randomised to either the Modified Single Item Screening Questionnaire (M-SASQ) or the Fast Alcohol Screening Test (FAST). There will be a minimum of 480 clients recruited into the trial. There will be an intention to treat analysis of study outcomes at 6 and 12 months post intervention. Analysis will include client measures (screening result, weekly alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, re-offending, public service use and quality of life) and implementation measures from OMs (the extent of screening and brief intervention beyond the minimum recruitment threshold will provide data on acceptability and feasibility of different models of brief intervention). We will also examine the practitioner and organisational factors associated with successful implementation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8796" xml_f="8806" txt_i="2076" txt_f="2086">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8817" xml_f="9039" txt_i="2087" txt_f="2309">The trial will evaluate the impact of screening and brief alcohol intervention in routine probation work and therefore its findings will be highly relevant to probation teams and thus the criminal justice system in the UK.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9046" xml_f="9104" txt_i="2310" txt_f="2364">Ethical approval was given by Northern &amp; Yorkshire REC</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9126" xml_f="9151" txt_i="2366" txt_f="2391">Trial Registration number</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9162" xml_f="9177" txt_i="2392" txt_f="2407">ISRCTN 19160244</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9239" xml_f="9249" txt_i="2416" txt_f="2426">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9260" xml_f="9393" txt_i="2427" txt_f="2560">In 2008 in the UK it was estimated that there were approximately 950,000 incidents of alcohol-related violence in the previous year [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="9424" xml_f="9425" txt_i="2560" txt_f="2561">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9432" xml_f="9628" txt_i="2561" txt_f="2757">].

Powering the study in this way will also account statistically for appropriate outcomes for screening approach and screening method. The primary outcome for this study is the proportion of offenders who are consuming alcohol within recommended levels at 6 and 12 month follow-up. Recent meta-analysis [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"><offsets xml_i="45403" xml_f="45405" txt_i="33539" txt_f="33541">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45412" xml_f="46081" txt_i="33541" txt_f="34210">] suggests that the difference between brief intervention and control is of the order 13%, 5% reduction in the control group and 18% in the brief intervention group. In order to detect a difference of this magnitude at the 5% significance level with 80% power, for a 2-sided test, requires 109 offenders in each of the 3 groups, a total of 327. Our experience with other multi-centre randomised controlled trials of interventions for alcohol use disorders suggests that with assiduous follow-up the potential loss to follow-up across groups is of the order 25%. Taking this loss into accounts inflates the sample required to 145 in each group, a total of 435 offenders.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46088" xml_f="46684" txt_i="34211" txt_f="34807">The proposed study involves a cluster design and requires a statistical adjustment to account for any potential cluster effect. The literature is unclear regarding an appropriate estimation of an intra-class correlation coefficient in this population. Our experience leads us to assume the ICC should be similar to primary care correlation coefficients, 0.04. Assuming a cluster size of the order 3 offenders this inflates the sample size calculation by a factor of 1.1 requiring 160 offenders in each group, a total of 480, with an expectation that at least 365 will be followed up at 12 months.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="46706" xml_f="46722" txt_i="34809" txt_f="34825">Planned analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="46733" xml_f="47286" txt_i="34826" txt_f="35379">As the study is pragmatic in design, the planned analysis will be by intention to treat. The primary outcome is dichotomous in nature, drinking within or above recommended levels, and will be analysed with logistic regression adjusting for all known prognostic factors; data will be presented as odds ratios and their corresponding confidence intervals.

The proposed trial will provide evidence that will go towards informing probation practices in England, the UK and outside the UK on screening and brief advice. In addition the trial will consider the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening and brief intervention at reducing alcohol consumption and its related problems, including re-offending whilst providing important information about implementation issues which will have an effect on future implementation by probation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="48970" xml_f="48989" txt_i="36936" txt_f="36955">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49000" xml_f="49058" txt_i="36956" txt_f="37014">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49080" xml_f="49102" txt_i="37016" txt_f="37038">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49113" xml_f="49997" txt_i="37039" txt_f="37923">All of the authors contributed to the design and development of this trial protocol.
