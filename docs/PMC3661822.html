Most categories contained insufficient numbers of events to be statistically meaningful, and there were no differences among the groups in the categories for which analysis was possible. Hospitalization was responsible for 91 and 94% of the SAEs before and after PO, respectively. The vast majority of SAEs (89%) were not related to study participation or intervention and 98% were either not or unlikely related. Only two SAEs were deemed probably related and two possibly related. Of these four events, two were severe hypoglycemia, one was hypoglycemia resulting in hospitalization, and one was an episode of DKA occurring in a participant for whom study medication had been discontinued for safety reasons (definitively elevated transaminases; see below). There were no participant deaths during the TODAY study. There were 12 cases of DKA (in 11 participants) and 5 occurrences (in 5 participants) of severe hypoglycemia. Despite a study requirement for appropriate contraceptive measures while taking study medication, there were 62 pregnancies in 45 participants during the TODAY study, and 6 (10%) were associated with a congenital anomaly. For those planning pregnancy, study medication was discontinued before attempts at conception. For those young women who became unexpectedly pregnant, study medication was discontinued at the first indication of pregnancy. Pregnancy tests were performed on all female participants at every visit. The 14 life-threatening SAEs were not significantly different among groups; of these, 7 were psychiatric hospitalizations due to suicidal ideation/attempt, 2 were DKA, 1 was severe hyperglycemia and ketosis (without acidosis), 2 were infections (one associated with a deep vein thrombosis, the other a postpartum infection), and 1 was lactic acidosis associated with asthma. This case of lactic acidosis (lactate level 9.8 mmol/L) occurred in a 15-year-old girl assigned to the M group during a severe asthma exacerbation. Aside from asthma, she was asymptomatic and the elevated lactate resolved within 12 h of asthma treatment. This was assessed by the local investigator and the SMC and determined to be unlikely related to metformin use. A single event of congestive heart failure occurred 6 days postpartum after a pregnancy complicated by hypertension. Although this occurred in a participant in the M + R group, the subject already had been off rosiglitazone for approximately 2 years 9 months before the heart failure developed. Therefore, this event was classified as not related to study intervention or participation. No life-threatening SAEs were classified as probably related, and the only one classified as possibly related to study participation was an episode of DKA occurring in a participant for whom study medication was discontinued 2 months earlier because of definitively elevated liver transaminases (AST, 211 IU/L; ALT, 256 IU/L).</offsets></p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="22147" xml_f="22154" txt_i="16925" txt_f="16932">Table 4</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="22174" xml_f="22227" txt_i="16932" txt_f="16985">Serious adverse events overall and by treatment group</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1765tbl4"></graphic></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s12"><title><offsets xml_i="22322" xml_f="22378" txt_i="16987" txt_f="17043">Discontinuations of study medication and primary outcome</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22389" xml_f="23087" txt_i="17044" txt_f="17742">The TODAY protocol specified blinded dose reduction/discontinuation in response to certain targeted AEs (definitively elevated transaminases, severe hypoglycemia, intercurrent illness, edema, anemia, and renal impairment).
