It is important to mention here that most of the recruitment was done in the summer months of May–July. The mean 25(OH)D level at baseline was 24.2 ± 15.1 ng/ml. Only 33% women were Vitamin D sufficient if a criteria of 25(OH)D of 30 ng/ml or more is followed, but 56% were Vitamin D sufficient with criteria of 25(OH)D of 20 ng/ml or more.

Postsupplementation, the overall status of vitamin sufficiency was better in Group 3 (2000 IU/day) irrespective of the regimen used monthly or daily. Vitamin D level significantly increased in all four groups with mean increment of 12.7 ± 23.9 ng/ml with 1000 IU/day, 17.1 ± 21.0 ng/ml with 2000 IU/day, 16.0 ± 14.6 ng/ml with 30,000 IU monthly, and 23.8 ± 18.1 ng/ml with 60,000 IU monthly.
