It aims to provide sufficient and appropriate energy as well as macro-and micronutrients for optimal growth, development and glycemic control. Carbohydrate (carb) counting allows adjustment of the prandial insulin dose for actual carb intake in T1DM patients on intensive insulin therapy. Carbs are the primary nutrients affecting postprandial glycemic response. Therefore, by calculating the carb amounts in each meal, the insulin doses required to preserve postprandial blood glucose within normal limits can be predicted (</offsets><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6094" xml_f="6095" txt_i="2405" txt_f="2406">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6102" xml_f="6103" txt_i="2406" txt_f="2407">,</offsets><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6136" xml_f="6137" txt_i="2407" txt_f="2408">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6144" xml_f="6610" txt_i="2408" txt_f="2874">). In the past 15 years, the introduction of insulin analogs and insulin pump therapy has made carb counting more popular. To date, there are no reports of randomized controlled studies pertaining to the efficacy of carb counting in metabolic control and body measurements of children with T1DM. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of carb counting on body measurements, glycemic control and serum lipid levels in children and adolescents with T1DM. </offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="6651" xml_f="6658" txt_i="2876" txt_f="2883">METHODS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6669" xml_f="7750" txt_i="2884" txt_f="3962">After exclusion of patients with obesity, chronic complications and/or communication difficulties, 110 T1DM children and adolescents aged 7-18 years were enrolled in the study. The duration of diabetes was &gt;1 years in all patients. Before the study, all patients were on the traditional exchange-based meal plan and were using glargine/detemir basal-bolus insulin regimens (fixed doses of insulin for food and changing the doses based on blood glucose levels). Out of the 110 patients, 55 were allocated randomly to the study group (the carb counting group) and 55 served as controls. Three patients from the study group who did not attend the follow-up visits regularly or could not acquire adequate carb counting skills after training were excluded, thus the study has been conducted on 52 children and adolescents with T1DM in this group. In the control group, 5 patients who withdrew their consent and 18 who did not attend the 3-month follow-up visits regularly were also excluded, thus the study has been conducted with 32 children and adolescents with T1DM in this group.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7757" xml_f="8907" txt_i="3963" txt_f="5113">Age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), total daily insulin requirements (U/kg/day) and HbA1c were recorded in all patients at baseline and at 3-month intervals. Additionally, morning fasting total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured with 1-year intervals. Height was measured to the nearest centimeter using a rigid stadiometer. Weight was measured unclothed to the nearest 0.1 kg using a calibrated balance scale. BMI was calculated by using the weight (kg)/height (m2) formula. Standard deviation scores (SDS) for weight, height and BMI were calculated using the reference values for Turkish children (3). HbA1c measurements were performed by capillary method using the Nycocard II Reader (Axis-Shield Diagnostics Ltd, Dundee, UK) device which is suitable for the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) Working Group reference system. Annual mean values for HbA1c were calculated by total HbA1c values divided by measurement times. TC, LDL, HDL and TG levels were measured using a Beckman Coulter Uni Cel® (Fullerton, CA) automatic analyzer.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8914" xml_f="10132" txt_i="5114" txt_f="6332">During a 2-week program, a diabetes team consisting of a diabetologist, a dietician and a nurse trained the patients in the carb counting group to count carbs. In the first week of the training sessions, the patients learned about the biological and nutritional contents of the food groups (carbs, fats, proteins, fiber, micronutrients) and their effects on blood glucose; they also learnt how to estimate the amount of carbs per meal. In addition, the study group received information about the importance of introducing a daily amount of carbs equal to 50%-55% of the total caloric intake and about the distribution of carb between meals. In the second week, the patients learned how to manage simple carbs and snacks and to adjust insulin doses in relation to the carb content of the meals, exercise and pre meal blood glucose values. Ideal insulin requirements were defined by measuring pre- and post-prandial as well as midnight blood glucose levels. In patients who achieved normal/near-normal blood glucose values at the end of 1 week, insulin/carb ratio (I/C) and insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) were calculated individually by dividing total daily insulin amounts to 500 and 1800 coefficients, respectively (</offsets><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10165" xml_f="10166" txt_i="6332" txt_f="6333">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10173" xml_f="10935" txt_i="6333" txt_f="7095">). In patients who had adequate knowledge and who also applied the procedures correctly, nutrition according to calculation model was initiated. In the first month after the training, I/C and ISF values were corrected if necessary according to blood glucose follow-ups by weekly phone calls or hospital visits. Training levels and applications by patients were evaluated during the outpatient follow-up visits performed at 3-month intervals by the same dietician and pediatric endocrinologist. Training was repeated for patients as required. In the control group of patients, nutritional and diabetic educations were repeated at the baseline of study, outpatient follow-up visits were performed with 3-month intervals and the education was repeated if necessary.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10942" xml_f="11254" txt_i="7096" txt_f="7408">The authors confirmed in writing that they have complied with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki regarding ethical conduct of research involving human subjects and/or animals.
