In response to Question no. 20, 85% of children felt that their vision was much worse than their friends’ vision; rest felt that it was a little worse than their friends.</offsets></p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="15793" xml_f="15800" txt_i="10605" txt_f="10612">Table 3</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="15820" xml_f="15879" txt_i="10612" txt_f="10671">Response to the LV Prasad-FQL pre-and postlow vision device</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="OJO-6-170-g003"></graphic></table-wrap><p><offsets xml_i="15956" xml_f="16153" txt_i="10672" txt_f="10869">We found that the difference in functional vision pre and post-LVD was statistically significant with those activities related to their studying/reading lifestyle like copying from the blackboard (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16161" xml_f="16162" txt_i="10869" txt_f="10870">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16171" xml_f="16220" txt_i="10870" txt_f="10916"> &lt; 0.0001), reading textbook at arm's length (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16228" xml_f="16229" txt_i="10916" txt_f="10917">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16238" xml_f="16284" txt_i="10917" txt_f="10960"> &lt; 0.0001), writing along a straight line (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16292" xml_f="16293" txt_i="10960" txt_f="10961">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16302" xml_f="16393" txt_i="10961" txt_f="11052"> = 0.003), and in certain other generalized activities like applying paste on tooth brush (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16401" xml_f="16402" txt_i="11052" txt_f="11053">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16411" xml_f="16516" txt_i="11053" txt_f="11158"> = 0.001) and in making out whether somebody is calling you by waving his/her hand from across the road (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16524" xml_f="16525" txt_i="11158" txt_f="11159">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16534" xml_f="16544" txt_i="11159" txt_f="11169"> = 0.001).</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title><offsets xml_i="16600" xml_f="16610" txt_i="11171" txt_f="11181">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16621" xml_f="16758" txt_i="11182" txt_f="11319">Functional vision has been defined as vision that can be used to perform a task requiring vision, that is, how a person uses his vision.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7"><offsets xml_i="16791" xml_f="16792" txt_i="11319" txt_f="11320">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16799" xml_f="16955" txt_i="11320" txt_f="11476">] Though there are several internationally accepted tools for assessing functional vision, most of them are not appropriate for use in pediatric age group.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9"><offsets xml_i="16988" xml_f="16989" txt_i="11476" txt_f="11477">9</offsets></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10"><offsets xml_i="17030" xml_f="17032" txt_i="11477" txt_f="11479">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17039" xml_f="17040" txt_i="11479" txt_f="11480">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17047" xml_f="17240" txt_i="11481" txt_f="11674">In the present study, we have used the LVP-FQL to measure the improvement in functional vision performance in children with low vision postrehabilitation.

It was interesting to observe that a statistically significant improvement also occurred in the same activities which were related to their academics, that is, there was a significant decrease in number of children who were unable to do their routine activities due to visual reasons. This we feel is a very important inference of the study since a timely implementation of vision rehabilitation could help in maximizing their academic output. Low vision interferes not only with their routine and academic activities but it has also been now well-established that low vision has psychological consequences as well thus making the children feel depressed, anxious, fearful, and confused. Along with this, withdrawal and denial are also associated psychological problems that do not allow these children to be an integral part of the society and the educational system.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14"><offsets xml_i="20165" xml_f="20167" txt_i="14210" txt_f="14212">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20174" xml_f="20175" txt_i="14212" txt_f="14213">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20182" xml_f="20300" txt_i="14214" txt_f="14332">Another important finding in our study was that none of the children had received any specialist support earlier.

Making use of a time-tested functional vision questionnaire designed specifically for children of developing nations, we observed that low vision interfered with the routine academic activities of most of the children and that there was a significant improvement in these activities post use of LVDs. An early visual rehabilitation could strengthen their visual abilities, thus improving their learning abilities and enabling them to continue getting education with their normally sighted peers.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shamanna</surname><given-names>BR</given-names></name><name><surname>Dandona</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>GN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Economic burden of blindness in India</article-title><source>Indian J Ophthalmol</source><year>1998</year><volume>46</volume><fpage>169</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10085631</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Daniel</surname><given-names>L Adams</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoyt</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Normal and abnormal visual development</article-title><year>2005</year><edition>3rd ed</edition><publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Elsevier Ltd</publisher-name><fpage>9</fpage><lpage>22</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pascolini</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mariotti</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global estimates of visual impairment: 2010</article-title><source>Br J Ophthalmol</source><year>2012</year><volume>96</volume><fpage>614</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22133988</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tabbara</surname><given-names>KF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Blindness in the eastern mediterranean countries</article-title><source>Br J Ophthalmol</source><year>2001</year><volume>85</volume><fpage>771</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11423445</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shaaban</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>El-Lakkany</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Swelam</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Anwar</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Low vision AIDS provision for visually impaired Egyptian patients-A clinical outcome</article-title><source>Middle East Afr J Ophthalmol</source><year>2009</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>29</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20142957</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Munoz</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>West</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Bandeen-Roche</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Fried</surname><given-names>LP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Characteristics of discrepancies between self-reported visual function and measured reading speed.
