Over-the-counter treatment options known to reduce pain and inflammation, such as oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may be associated with systemic side effects (e.g. gastrointestinal), while topically applied rubefacients are frequently ineffective, despite their popularity. DSG 1%, which has been clinically proven to be effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of osteoarthritis, could be a new option for the treatment of acute injuries, such as ankle sprains. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of DSG 1% applied q.i.d in subjects with acute ankle sprain.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4066" xml_f="4074" txt_i="713" txt_f="721">Methods:</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4085" xml_f="4885" txt_i="722" txt_f="1522">In a double-blind, multicenter study, 205 subjects with acute sprain of the lateral ankle (Grade l-ll) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to DSG 1% (n=102) or placebo (n=103) applied q.i.d for 7 days. The primary efficacy outcome was pain-on-movement (POM) at 72 hours, assessed on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary efficacy outcomes included ankle swelling assessed by circumference measurement compared with the non-affected ankle, tenderness measured by pressure algometry compared with the non-affected ankle, and ankle joint function assessed by the Karlsson scoring scale. Efficacy assessments were conducted at clinic visits at 12, 24, and 72 hours and 7 days after treatment initiation. All adverse events were recorded and blood samples were collected for laboratory safety analysis.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4907" xml_f="4915" txt_i="1524" txt_f="1532">Results:</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4926" xml_f="5055" txt_i="1533" txt_f="1662">DSG 1% treatment resulted in a significant decrease of POM mean scores when compared with placebo (57 mm vs. 21 mm respectively; </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5063" xml_f="5064" txt_i="1662" txt_f="1663">p</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5073" xml_f="5436" txt_i="1663" txt_f="2023">&lt;0.0001).
