The C-reactive protein (CRP) serves as a general marker of inflammation, and inverse relationships between CRP levels and cognitive performance in acute psychosis have been demonstrated. Here we aimed to investigate how the serum level and initial change of CRP in acutely admitted patients with psychosis were correlated with cognitive performance during a 6-months follow-up period.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s2"><title><offsets xml_i="4449" xml_f="4456" txt_i="596" txt_f="603">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4467" xml_f="4996" txt_i="604" txt_f="1133">The study is part of a pragmatic, randomized trial comparing four different second-generation antipsychotic drugs, and consists of 208 acute phase patients recruited at admittance for psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, acute and transient psychotic disorder, delusional disorder, drug-induced psychosis, bipolar disorder except for manic psychosis, or major depressive disorder with psychotic features).

The different cognitive subdomains showed different time-dependent profiles of improvement, with memory and attention improving significantly also in the later phases. Reduction of the CRP level during the initial follow-up interval (T1–T2) was associated with increased overall cognitive performance in the T2–T4 interval, but not in the T1–T2 interval. For the cognitive subdomains, we found an inverse association between change in CRP level and learning (T1–T2 interval), verbal abilities (T2–T4 interval), and attention (T2–T3 interval).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s4"><title><offsets xml_i="5930" xml_f="5940" txt_i="1995" txt_f="2005">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5951" xml_f="6424" txt_i="2006" txt_f="2479">The main finding of the present study was that the global cognitive performance continued to improve from the initial phase (baseline to 4 weeks) of acute psychosis to the later phase (4 weeks–6 months), and was predicted by the change in CRP level that was observed during the initial phase (baseline–4 weeks) of the treatment. These findings might indicate a prolonged effect of inflammatory processes on cognition in acute psychosis, stretching beyond the initial phase.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6431" xml_f="6634" txt_i="2480" txt_f="2683">There is substantial evidence that inflammatory processes are involved in the cognitive performance in psychosis.
