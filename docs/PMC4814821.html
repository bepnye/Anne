Telemonitoring has been proposed as a solution to this growing problem, but its impact on patient outcome is equivocal. This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate effectiveness of telemonitoring in improving COPD patient outcome. In total, 106 subjects were randomly assigned to the telemonitoring (n = 53) or usual care (n = 53) group. During the two months following discharge, telemonitoring group patients had to report their symptoms daily using an electronic diary. The primary outcome measure was time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation within six months of discharge. During the follow-up period, time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation was significantly increased in the telemonitoring group than in the usual care group (p = 0.026). Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all-cause re-admissions (0.23 vs. 0.68/patient; p = 0.002) and emergency room visits (0.36 vs. 0.91/patient; p = 0.006). In conclusion, telemonitoring intervention was associated with improved outcomes among COPD patients admitted for exacerbation in a country characterized by a small territory and high accessibility to medical services. The findings are encouraging and add further support to implementation of telemonitoring as part of COPD care.</offsets></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><offsets xml_i="8081" xml_f="8268" txt_i="1439" txt_f="1626">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its prevalence and burden of COPD are projected to increase over the next decades</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1"><offsets xml_i="8299" xml_f="8300" txt_i="1626" txt_f="1627">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8307" xml_f="8460" txt_i="1627" txt_f="1780">.

However, the diversity with regard to study populations, technology employed and components of the telehealth services has been high across the studies. Undoubtedly, there is an urgent need for further investigations to clarify the specific role of telemonitoring in the management of patients with COPD. The distinguishing features of the present study included the fact that it was conducted in a small, isolated island country, the study subjects were enrolled during admission for COPD exacerbation, and they were provided with easily accessible and affordable healthcare under the Taiwan NHI program. Therefore, our findings add to the existing knowledge by showing the effectiveness of telemonitoring intervention in terms of improving COPD patient outcomes in this specific setting.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23267" xml_f="23434" txt_i="14859" txt_f="15026">Telehealth is a complex intervention and may include a variety of components, such as education, counseling, emotional support, remote monitoring and assisted planning</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19"><offsets xml_i="23466" xml_f="23468" txt_i="15026" txt_f="15028">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23475" xml_f="24175" txt_i="15028" txt_f="15728">. Accordingly, when telehealth intervention is beneficial for the patients, it is difficult to pinpoint its active component. In this study, patients in both groups were provided with medical counseling via a phone call given that it was not only part of our routine practice but might help ease the patients’ anxiety and feeling of unsafety when they were randomly assigned to the usual care group. In this way, the only difference between the two study groups was the remote monitoring and response to changing signs and symptoms of patients with COPD.

First, our sample size of this study did not allow for a subgroup analysis to define the most appropriate population for telemonitoring intervention, an important issue that is worth exploring in further studies. However, the sample size estimation was based on the primary outcome measure, and the predetermined significance level has been achieved in this study, except for the fact that the study included 106 patients as opposed to 116. Second, cost-effectiveness was not assessed in this study, because the study team was engaged in both study work and clinical service, and it was difficult to accurately calculate the direct and indirect personnel expense. In this regard, we are planning on an economic study to answer this question. Third, it was not possible to blind the study subjects and study personnel to treatment allocation given the interactive nature of the intervention. However, the outcome assessor was blinded to group allocation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27570" xml_f="28144" txt_i="18787" txt_f="19361">In summary, telemonitoring used to care for patients discharged for COPD exacerbation improves outcomes in terms of time to COPD-related re-admission, and average number of all-cause re-admissions and ER visits in the six-month follow-up. The findings are encouraging and promising, and add further support to the concept that telemonitoring is worth implementation as part of COPD care. Nevertheless, the favorable experience needs to be replicated in a large population under healthcare settings similar to those of Taiwan prior to widespread application of this modality.</offsets></p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title><offsets xml_i="28181" xml_f="28203" txt_i="19363" txt_f="19385">Additional Information</offsets></title><p><bold><offsets xml_i="28220" xml_f="28244" txt_i="19386" txt_f="19410">How to cite this article</offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="28251" xml_f="28263" txt_i="19410" txt_f="19422">: Ho, T.-W. </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="28271" xml_f="28277" txt_i="19422" txt_f="19428">et al.</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="28286" xml_f="28415" txt_i="19428" txt_f="19557"> Effectiveness of Telemonitoring in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Taiwan-A Randomized Controlled Trial. </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="28423" xml_f="28432" txt_i="19557" txt_f="19566">Sci.
