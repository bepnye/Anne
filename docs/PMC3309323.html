However, a reaching motion at the fast speed reflects the maximum allowed torque power of articulation and a degree of strength in upper limb function. Smoothness of the movement can be utilized as a good index to measure a degree of spasticity for normalized jerk score of the motion.

In this study, it was confirmed that the normalized jerk score at the comfortable speed was lower than the one at the fast speed. This indicates that the motion of reaching upper limb out is more natural at the comfortable speed than at the fast speed, showing that spasticityincreased at the fast velocity. On the opposite, mean time and mean angular velocity of shoulders and wrists were estimated faster than those at comfortable speed. The degree of strength at fast speed and torque power of articulation increased more at speed velocity than fast speed.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20799" xml_f="21958" txt_i="14492" txt_f="15642">From the result of motion analysis of before and after in each group, the experimental group showed a significant difference in the movement time of comfortable speed and fast speed, mean velocity, normalized jerk score, mean angular velocity of wrist, shoulder, elbows and normal jerk score of wrist on reaching motion (p&lt;0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the normalized jerk score of shoulder while moving (p&gt;0.05). This reflects a training characteristic that puts priority on the elbow and wrist. In addition, derivation of proper posture and intensification of muscular strength of wrists through comprehensive hand repetitive intensive strength training can be be effective on the movement time for the upper limb, torque power of the wrist, and normalized jerk score of the wrist while moving. The group that underwent the home program showed a significant difference only on the mean movement time at comfortable velocity (p&lt;0.05). Such a result suggests that the home program improves muscular strength, influencing movement velocity, but did not influence the angular velocity of articulation and normalized jerk score.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21965" xml_f="22221" txt_i="15643" txt_f="15896">The difference between the experimental and control group showed a significant difference since a reaching motion improved only for movement time at comfortable speed, angular velocity of wrist, and normalized jerk score of wrist at fast speed (p&lt;0.05).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22228" xml_f="23547" txt_i="15897" txt_f="17216">There were a few limitations in this study. First, the study was conducted only using the motion of reaching out of the upper limb. Among motions involved in activities of daily living, many other motions including bringing hands to mouth or moving hands over the heads were excluded but only considered a motion of forward in order to touch for this study. There should be an objective and quantitative study on the motion analysis via various motions occurred on activities of daily living. Second, a difference of electrical activation for the muscle of the upper limb could not be analyzed. When analyzing the muscle electrical activation while reaching out, detailed changes of each muscle can be understood, and may be available to suggest correlations of movement and muscle activation from comprehensive hand repetitive intensive strength training. Third, tools specially designed for comprehensive hand repetitive intensive strength training were definitely helpful for training of the upper limbs of children with cerebral palsy, but at least one therapist was required to correct posture during training, taking 60 minutes of training time, which requires tremendous efforts by the therapist. Tools specially designed for the training had to be modified in order to conduct effective treatment in the future.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23569" xml_f="23579" txt_i="17218" txt_f="17228">CONCLUSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23590" xml_f="24783" txt_i="17229" txt_f="18422">In this study, a total of 19 children with cerebral palsy were selectedto undergo comprehensive hand repetitive intensive strength training and general rehabilitation 30 times in ten weeks on ten children in the experimental group. However, nine children in the control group were given home-program and general rehabilitation, comparing the reaching motion at a comfortable speed and at a fast speed through motion analysis. The difference between before and after treatment of each group was compared. The group that received comprehensive hand repetitive intensive strength training showed a significant difference for the motion of reaching hands out both at comfortable speed and at fast speed since movement time, mean velocity, and normalized jerk score of upper limb were enhanced after having a training. This objectively confirms that comprehensive hand repetitive intensive strength training is a treatment that is helpful toenhance upper limb movement of the elbow and wrist. This highly suggests utilizing comprehensive hand repetitive intensive strength training as a rehabilitation treatment that enhances capability of exercising for upper limbsof children with cerebral palsy.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This research was supported by a grant (10-B-03) by Korea National Rehabilitation Research
