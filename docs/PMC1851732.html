However, light is used as a treatment for some medical conditions related to rhythm, most notably seasonal affective disorder. In this study, the researchers wanted to examine the role of light in influencing the menstrual cycle. In the trial reported here, 22 women with lengthened menstrual cycles were provided with a light box that emitted either bright light or dim light, and the women were asked to use the light box for a defined period each day for one menstrual cycle. The study had a crossover design, where women would receive either bright or dim light for one cycle, then another cycle without the light box, and finally a cycle with either bright or dim light, whichever they did not receive first. Outcomes assessed in the trial included measurements of the blood levels of certain hormones. Specifically, the researchers looked at three hormones that determine the reproductive cycle (lutenizing hormone [LH], follicle stimulating hormone [FSH], and prolactin); these are produced by a region of the brain that is controlled by the hypothalamus, a gland that is directly responsive to light. Additionally, ultrasound scans were used to check for ovulation during each cycle. The trial was carried out in winter in Novosibirsk, a Russian city.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7241" xml_f="7242" txt_i="3489" txt_f="3490">

Ovulation was more likely in the “bright light” phase of the study as compared to the “dim light” phase. However, levels of two other hormones, thyroid stimulating hormone, and estradiol, were not significantly different when comparing the “bright” and “dim” cycles.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7756" xml_f="7757" txt_i="3985" txt_f="3986">

A further strength in this study was the use of ultrasound scans to allow the researchers to pinpoint ovulation in the participants; similar studies have not tried to examine the effects of light both on reproductive hormones and ovulation. A weakness of the design is that participants were assigned to receive either dim light first or bright light first using alternation, not true randomization. Therefore blinding was not possible and the researchers recruiting participants would have known in advance what intervention each participant would receive first. Other weaknesses include the limited number of participants in this study, and the nature of the participant population, all of whom had lengthened menstrual cycles and were living at fairly northerly latitude.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8743" xml_f="8744" txt_i="4953" txt_f="4954">

The advertisement was as follows: “Women with lengthened menstrual cycles (30–38 days) are invited to participate in a study. Ultrasound and hormonal investigations will be conducted free of charge”. Respondents provided dates of menstruation onset over the past year and suitable candidates were invited for clinical interview. During the interview with the investigators (both are clinicians), they received a detailed description of the study, completed a questionnaire concerning their general health and answered some medical questions from the clinicians.

It is clear that the increased rate of ovulation following bright light exposure is a consequence of faster follicle maturation. Follicle maturation, in turn, is determined by the complex interrelated changes in the secretion of pituitary-ovarian hormones. The neuroanatomical basis for the effect of light may include the novel melanopsin-based photoreceptors in the eye conveying information via the retinohypothalamic tract (separate from the optic nerve) to the biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (reviewed in [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020007-b018" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="33515" xml_f="33517" txt_i="24920" txt_f="24922">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33524" xml_f="33881" txt_i="24922" txt_f="25279">]). There are likely to be numerous other links from the hypothalamus, yet the pathway to the pineal gland—secreting the darkness neurohormone melatonin—is the only one well studied.
