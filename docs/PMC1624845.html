Guidelines in western countries for management of poisoning indicate that gastric lavage should be performed only if two criteria are met: within one hour of poison ingestion and substantial ingested amount. But the evidence on which these guidelines are based is from medicine overdoses in developed countries and may be irrelevant to OP poisoning in Asia. Chinese clinical experience suggests that OP remains in the stomach for several hours or even days after ingestion. Thus, there may be reasons for doing single or multiple gastric lavages for OP poisoning. There have been no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess this practice of multiple lavages. Since it is currently standard therapy in China, we cannot perform a RCT of no lavage vs. a single lavage vs. multiple lavages. We will compare a single gastric lavage with three gastric lavages as the first stage to assess the role of gastric lavage in OP poisoning.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5585" xml_f="5599" txt_i="1069" txt_f="1083">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5610" xml_f="6413" txt_i="1084" txt_f="1887">We have designed an RCT assessing the effectiveness of multiple gastric lavages in adult OP self-poisoning patients admitted to three Chinese hospitals within 12 hrs of ingestion.

Building on these strengths allows the GLAOP study to evaluate the impact, and associated mechanisms of gastric lavage action on longer-term patient outcomes, and to generate hypotheses for future research. Ultimately, the GLAOP study seeks to inform clinicians about the gastric lavage therapy in pesticide poisoning, so as to facilitate change in clinical practice and improve outcomes for pesticide poisoning patients. The GLAOP study has potential limitations. First, besides times of gastric lavage, there are many known factors influencing the result. These include ingestion time, particular OP, amount of ingestion, the underlying disease and so on. Furthermore some important factors may be unknown or unmeasured, resulting in residual confounding and bias. If these differences are associated with the outcomes of interest, the study results may be difficult to analyze. Fortunately, software for the randomization has been used in the triage of the trial. Second, because of the ethic concern, group without lavage at all can not be set up in China to investigate its role in OP patients directly. No matter what result was put out, single lavage better or multiple lavages better, it is difficult to put forward the trial further because of the different ethic concerns in the world. For example, if multiple lavage shows no better than single lavage, it is a long journey to set up a RCT to explore the difference between single lavage and no lavage in China. Third, although drawn from 3 different medical centers and a treatment protocol has been used, all these hospitals are in China; thus, the GLAOP study results may not generalize to OP patients in other settings.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29441" xml_f="30048" txt_i="23395" txt_f="24002">These limitations suggest several directions for future studies. First, the design of future randomized trials of gastric lavage. Narrow the inclusion criteria of OP patients, then the respective factors can be studied better. Second, in order to put forward relative studies thereafter, communications with experts in the world are necessary. Winning the understanding of the trial and its importance, it will be better to accomplish the trials. Finally, additional observational studies especially taken outside of China should be conducted to assess the generalizability of findings from the GLAOP study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30055" xml_f="30553" txt_i="24003" txt_f="24501">In summary, the GLAOP study is a prospective cohort study that seeks to provide new knowledge about the association of gastric lavage, particular OP and other aspects of OP with the patient outcomes.

Results from the GLAOP study should help to explore to the toxic kinetics of OP and effects of gastric lavage on it, help to improve the care and outcomes of OP patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="30575" xml_f="30588" txt_i="24503" txt_f="24516">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="30599" xml_f="30829" txt_i="24517" txt_f="24747">GLAOP = gastric lavage in acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning; OP = organophosphorus; RCT = randomised controlled trials; ICU = intensive care unit; ECG = electric cardiac graph; DMEC = data monitoring and ethics committee.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="30851" xml_f="30870" txt_i="24749" txt_f="24768">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="30881" xml_f="30941" txt_i="24769" txt_f="24829">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="30963" xml_f="30985" txt_i="24831" txt_f="24853">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="31018" xml_f="31041" txt_i="24856" txt_f="24879">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31052" xml_f="31116" txt_i="24880" txt_f="24944">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-227X/6/10/prepub"></ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>ME is a Wellcome Trust Career Development Fellow funded by grant GR063560MA from the Wellcome's Tropical Interest Group.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="other"><article-title>The impact of pesticides on health: preventing intentional and unintentional deaths from pesticide poisoning</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int"></ext-link></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Eddleston</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Patterns and problems of deliberate self-poisoning in the developing world</article-title><source>QJM</source><year>2000</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>715</fpage><lpage>731</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11077028</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1093/qjmed/93.11.715</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>YL</given-names></name><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>WG</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gastric lavage for OP pesticides poisoning patients</article-title><source>Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi</source><year>2004</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>388</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><comment>[In Chinese]</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15555321</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Q</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The experience of repeated gastric lavage in acute severe OP pesticides</article-title><source>SiChuan Medicine</source><year>2002</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>108</fpage><lpage>109</lpage><comment>[In Chinese]</comment></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>QH</given-names></name><name><surname>Liao</surname><given-names>LQ</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Liao</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The observation of repeated gastric lavage in acute severe OP pesticides</article-title><source>SiChuan Medicine</source><year>2002</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>861</fpage><comment>[In Chinese]</comment></citation></ref><ref id="B6"><citation citation-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>HZ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pesticide Poisoning.
