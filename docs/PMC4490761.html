The age, gender, social circumstances and physical disorder of a character were randomly allocated to each student. The students wrote repeated assignments in the first person, writing as their character and including details of living with the disorder in all of their narratives.

Although it was not seen as a separate movement at the time, a number of novelists such as Balzac, Flaubert, Eliot and Zola included realistic medical content in their novels. Rothfield analysed a selection of British and French medical realist novels, and noted that although realism is often equated with representation, the connection between medicine and realism varied with the purpose and period of the author.

Withered and shrunken, they had taken on the greyish colour of mud…” Rothfield argues that medicine provided novelists with narrative strategies, epistemological assumptions and models of professional authority, and early medical realist novels in particular tended to portray illness as “either a fundamental ontological predicament or a punctual sign of innate moral inadequacy” [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18"><offsets xml_i="11877" xml_f="11879" txt_i="6247" txt_f="6249">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11886" xml_f="11888" txt_i="6249" txt_f="6251">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11895" xml_f="12262" txt_i="6252" txt_f="6619">Realism was replaced by other movements, including anti-realism, naturalism, detective fiction, modernism and post-modernism.

The assignments were not about their health problem, but were written in a “clinical realism” style, which, where possible, introduced some details about how they lived with their disorder into each piece of writing. They also wove details of the history of their disorder into their stories where it was relevant. The writing was mainly done as “homework”, and was discussed in a weekly workshop, where students were asked to comment separately on the creative writing and the medical realism aspects of each submission.

To create their characters, the students initially chose two letters, which became the initials of their character’s name. They then drew randomly from a selection of paper slips with diagnoses on - in this cohort, irritable bowel syndrome, post head injury with memory impairment, post-treatment breast cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C and type 1 diabetes. They drew further slips to determine their age, sex, what sort of accommodation they lived in and who they lived with. They then chose names for their characters and completed a character creation questionnaire, which included details of their character, including details of their disorder and how it affected them, and also other aspects such as their appearance, what sort of clothes they wore, where they did their shopping, hobbies, aspirations, regrets and how they saw their future.

A medical realism approach to creative writing, combined with creating and then repeatedly writing about the same fictional character, offers the potential for a low-cost intervention in a safe and convenient environment, which can potentially help to increase the empathic ability of students. As such, it merits further assessment, which may be most appropriately carried out by qualitative methods.</offsets></p><sec id="Sec15"><title><offsets xml_i="49628" xml_f="49652" txt_i="39107" txt_f="39131">Ethics/consent statement</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49663" xml_f="49883" txt_i="39132" txt_f="39352">This article is based on a poster developed by PM and the other students.
