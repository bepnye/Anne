This paper describes the experiences and determinants of stigma reported by the primary caregivers of people living with schizophrenia (PLS) in India. The study used mixed methods and was nested in a randomised controlled trial of community care for people with schizophrenia. Between November 2009 and October 2010, data on caregiver stigma and functional outcomes were collected from a sample of 282 PLS–caregiver dyads. In addition, 36 in-depth-interviews were conducted with caregivers. Quantitative findings indicate that ‘high caregiver stigma’ was reported by a significant minority of caregivers (21%) and that many felt uncomfortable to disclose their family member's condition (45%). Caregiver stigma was independently associated with higher levels of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, higher levels of disability, younger PLS age, household education at secondary school level and research site. Knowledge about schizophrenia was not associated with caregiver stigma. Qualitative data illustrate the various ways in which stigma affected the lives of family caregivers and reveal relevant links between caregiver-stigma related themes (‘others finding out’, ‘negative reactions’ and ‘negative feelings and views about the self’) and other themes in the data.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7165" xml_f="7811" txt_i="1497" txt_f="2143">Findings highlight the need for interventions that address both the needs of PLS and their family caregivers. Qualitative data also illustrate the complexities surrounding the relationship between knowledge and stigma and suggest that providing ‘knowledge about schizophrenia’ may influence the process of stigmatisation in both positive and negative ways. We posit that educational interventions need to consider context-specific factors when choosing anti-stigma-messages to be conveyed. Our findings suggest that messages such as ‘recovery is possible’ and ‘no-one is to blame’ may be more helpful than focusing on bio-medical knowledge alone.</offsets></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title><offsets xml_i="7890" xml_f="7900" txt_i="2155" txt_f="2165">Highlights</offsets></title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label><offsets xml_i="7965" xml_f="7966" txt_i="2166" txt_f="2167">•</offsets></label><p><offsets xml_i="7977" xml_f="8054" txt_i="2167" txt_f="2244">Experiences of being blamed and worries about marital prospects were salient.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label><offsets xml_i="8099" xml_f="8100" txt_i="2245" txt_f="2246">•</offsets></label><p><offsets xml_i="8111" xml_f="8189" txt_i="2246" txt_f="2324">Caregivers' and PLS' experiences of stigma were determined by similar factors.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label><offsets xml_i="8234" xml_f="8235" txt_i="2325" txt_f="2326">•</offsets></label><p><offsets xml_i="8246" xml_f="8325" txt_i="2326" txt_f="2405">Knowledge was linked to stigma in qualitative but not in quantitative analyses.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label><offsets xml_i="8370" xml_f="8371" txt_i="2406" txt_f="2407">•</offsets></label><p><offsets xml_i="8382" xml_f="8464" txt_i="2407" txt_f="2489">Context-specific messages rather than biomedical knowledge may help reduce stigma.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label><offsets xml_i="8509" xml_f="8510" txt_i="2490" txt_f="2491">•</offsets></label><p><offsets xml_i="8521" xml_f="8602" txt_i="2491" txt_f="2572">Family caregivers need access to emotional and social support in their own right.</offsets></p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Stigma</kwd><kwd>Discrimination</kwd><kwd>Knowledge</kwd><kwd>Schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>Mental illness</kwd><kwd>Caregiver</kwd><kwd>Family</kwd><kwd>India</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label><offsets xml_i="8916" xml_f="8917" txt_i="2581" txt_f="2582">1</offsets></label><title><offsets xml_i="8932" xml_f="8944" txt_i="2582" txt_f="2594">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8955" xml_f="9058" txt_i="2595" txt_f="2698">Problems related to stigma do not only affect persons suffering from mental illness but also families (</offsets><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9092" xml_f="9113" txt_i="2698" txt_f="2719">Corrigan et al., 2006</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9120" xml_f="9122" txt_i="2719" txt_f="2721">, </offsets><xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9156" xml_f="9175" txt_i="2721" txt_f="2740">Phelan et al., 1998</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9182" xml_f="9337" txt_i="2740" txt_f="2895">).

The negative impact of this form of stigma (which we will refer to as ‘family stigma’) may be particularly marked in settings where family cohesion is high. In India, as in many low and middle-income countries (LAMIC), most people living with schizophrenia (PLS) live with their families and rely on them for both economic support and everyday care (</offsets><xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9779" xml_f="9790" txt_i="3262" txt_f="3273">Thara, 1993</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9797" xml_f="10043" txt_i="3273" txt_f="3519">). Thus, family members are closely involved in most aspects of PLS’ care and often maintain control of help-seeking and treatment decisions, assuming many of the roles filled by health or social care staff in high-income country (HIC) settings (</offsets><xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10077" xml_f="10089" txt_i="3519" txt_f="3531">Nunley, 1998</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10096" xml_f="10275" txt_i="3531" txt_f="3710">).

Stigma adds to the burden of caregiving and affects the lives of family members of PLS in multiple ways.

On the other hand, not being able to draw upon an illness concept that would explain abnormal behaviours without anyone being at fault, might have had negative repercussions in the form of blaming and critical comments. Supporting this, there was evidence, both in caregivers' and PLS’ qualitative narratives, that not understanding the symptoms of schizophrenia led to blaming responses. Some caregivers specifically said that learning that the PLS’ behaviours were due to an illness and not intentional helped them respond better, which had in turn improved the relationships within the family (see interview quotation above). Others reported that learning about the availability of treatment had been a huge relief and made it easier to talk to others about the condition.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="69814" xml_f="70464" txt_i="53676" txt_f="54326">Conversely, quantitative caregiver stigma scores (a conglomerate measure of caregiver stigma rather than blaming per se) were not correlated with knowledge about schizophrenia as measured by the KASI. As the KASI measures knowledge about schizophrenia according to a Western bio-medical model of mental illness, this suggests that having a better understanding of this biomedical illness model did not reduce stigma, at least not the aspects of stigma measured quantitatively.

That is, caregivers being more aware of the bio-medical illness model of schizophrenia did not protect them from experiencing stigma, and possibly had a negative effect on PLS’ experiences of discrimination (the nature and direction of the association remain unclear). These findings are supported by a growing body of research indicating that certain forms of knowledge, particularly information projecting a biomedical model of mental illness, may increase rather than decrease social distance from people with mental illness (</offsets><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="71990" xml_f="72009" txt_i="55638" txt_f="55657">Phelan et al., 2006</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="72016" xml_f="72018" txt_i="55657" txt_f="55659">, </offsets><xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="72052" xml_f="72074" txt_i="55659" txt_f="55681">Schomerus et al., 2012</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="72081" xml_f="72083" txt_i="55681" txt_f="55683">, </offsets><xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="72117" xml_f="72134" txt_i="55683" txt_f="55700">Yang et al., 2012</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="72141" xml_f="72824" txt_i="55700" txt_f="56383">). Overall, our findings suggest that ‘knowledge about schizophrenia’ interacts with the process of stigmatisation in complex ways. They add to the existing evidence that knowledge conveying a bio-medical model of illness may not be beneficial or even harmful when seeking to reduce stigma. On the other hand, some aspects of knowledge, such as information on the nature and management of symptoms, may be helpful in terms of reducing certain types of stigmatising responses, e.g. blaming. Educational interventions need to consider carefully what messages should be conveyed in the interest of reducing stigma, taking into account context-specific illness beliefs and attributions (</offsets><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="72857" xml_f="72877" txt_i="56383" txt_f="56403">Charles et al., 2007</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="72884" xml_f="72886" txt_i="56403" txt_f="56405">, </offsets><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="72920" xml_f="72936" txt_i="56405" txt_f="56421">Das et al., 2006</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="72943" xml_f="72945" txt_i="56421" txt_f="56423">).</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><label><offsets xml_i="72985" xml_f="72988" txt_i="56426" txt_f="56429">4.4</offsets></label><title><offsets xml_i="73003" xml_f="73020" txt_i="56429" txt_f="56446">Study limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="73031" xml_f="74165" txt_i="56447" txt_f="57581">Despite efforts to make the study sample representative, it is limited to caregivers of PLS in psychiatric care. We have further discussed that the KASI reflects knowledge of a biomedical model of schizophrenia, and it is possible that results would have been different if a measure of illness understanding more in line with local explanatory models had been used. Language and cultural barriers, and the fact that many study collaborators were psychiatrists, may also have played a role in data analysis and interpretation. There was oversampling of dyads with higher discrimination reported by PLS in the qualitative sample, which might have increased the likelihood of more severe stigma in families being reported in the qualitative data. However, the impact on caregiver stigma findings overall is considered limited, as confirmed by a comparison of caregiver stigma scores between the total sample and the qualitative sample which revealed no significant difference (p = 0.10). Finally, it is possible that social desirability, loyalty and the wish not to speak negatively about family members may have influenced the findings.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><label><offsets xml_i="74199" xml_f="74202" txt_i="57583" txt_f="57586">4.5</offsets></label><title><offsets xml_i="74217" xml_f="74229" txt_i="57586" txt_f="57598">Implications</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="74240" xml_f="74743" txt_i="57599" txt_f="58102">The findings of this study have implications for research, practice and stigma interventions.
