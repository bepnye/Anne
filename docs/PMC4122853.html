Randomisation was at the level of stroke service. Participants’ use of health/social care services and informal care were measured by self-complete questionnaires at baseline, 6 and 12 months. From these, we estimated and compared individual-level total costs from health/social care and societal perspectives at 6 months, 12 months and over 1 year. Costs were combined with the primary outcome, psychological health (General Health Questionnaire 12; GHQ12), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; based on the EQ-5D) to examine cost-effectiveness at 6 months. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves based on the net benefit approach and bootstrapping techniques were used to estimate the probability of cost-effectiveness.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title><offsets xml_i="6067" xml_f="6074" txt_i="1136" txt_f="1143">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6085" xml_f="6819" txt_i="1144" txt_f="1878">32 services were randomised, of which 29 participated, and 800 stroke patients (401 intervention, 399 control) and 208 carers (108 intervention, 100 control) were recruited. Costs of SCC inputs (mean difference £42; 95% CI: -30, 116) and total health and social care costs at 6 months, 12 months and over 1 year were similar between groups. Total costs from the societal perspective were higher in the intervention group due to greater use of informal care (+£1163 at 6 months, 95% CI 56 to 3271; +£4135 at 12 months, 95% CI 618 to 7652). There were no differences in GHQ12 or QALYs and the probability of the system of care being cost-effective at 6 months was low at the current policy threshold of £20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gain.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="6864" xml_f="6875" txt_i="1880" txt_f="1891">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6886" xml_f="7086" txt_i="1892" txt_f="2092">The system of care was not cost-effective compared with usual care in this patient group over the period we examined.
