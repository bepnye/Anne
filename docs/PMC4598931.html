Due to the relatively small sample size, inherent to a clinical trial, it was impossible to identify variables with a capacity to predict the response to the MAD. It is possible that the new techniques of image evaluation of the upper airway play a role in identifying patients that respond well to a treatment with MAD. This should be considered as priority in the clinical research in this field (</offsets><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="37817" xml_f="37819" txt_i="27689" txt_f="27691">29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37826" xml_f="38126" txt_i="27691" txt_f="27991">).

The etiology of such a response to the MAD is not totally understood and has been related to anatomical changes particularly in the position of the hyoid bone.

However, this sample size did not allow for patients sub grouping to identify factors that could be associated with a good response to the treatment with MAD. The criterion of maximum mandibular advancement, that was limited to a minimum of 65% of the maximum mandibular protrusion, was arbitrarily established. It is possible that lesser mandibular advancement could obtain similar results but with fewer secondary effects. Future research would test this hypothesis and establish a criteria to maximize the benefits and minimize the secondary effects. An important limitation to this study is that the used PD has not been a truly placebo (the results of the sleep study were affected by the PD). This limitation should be considered when analyzing the results of this clinical trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39374" xml_f="39898" txt_i="29188" txt_f="29712">Within the limitation of this study, the use of MAD is efficient to reduce the AHI y improve subjectively the roncopathy. Thus, MAD could be considered in the treatment of mild-to-moderate OSA and chronic roncopathy. Further studies should evaluate the hypothesis of obtaining similar outcomes at minimal secondary effects when shorter mandibular advancement is achieved. Studies with larger sample size are still needed to establish the patient profile that could be associated with a good response to a treatment with MAD.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Grant number 00/0844 from Carlos III health Institute and grant number 200011020 from Health Department of Basque Country Government. </p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Palta</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dempsey</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Skatrud</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Badr</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The occurrence of sleep-disordered breathing among middle-aged adults</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>1993</year><volume>328</volume><fpage>1230</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8464434</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Duran</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Esnaola</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubio</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Iztueta</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnea and related clinical features in a population-based sample of subjects aged 30 to 70 yr</article-title><source>Am J Respir Crit Care Med</source><year>2001</year><volume>163</volume><fpage>685</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11254524</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Durán-Cantolla</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Puertas-Cuesta</surname><given-names>FJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Pin-Arboledas</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Santa María-Cano</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>el Grupo Español de Sueño</surname><given-names>GES</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Consenso Nacional sobre el síndrome de apneas-hipopneas del sue-o.
