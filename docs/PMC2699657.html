This made accurate measurement of baseline severity and a change in clinical condition difficult. This problem may have been compounded by the fact that we did not use a validated scale for PD psychosis as none was available at the start of the study. Both the BPRS and NPI are composite scales assessing many different neuropsychiatric symptom domains and therefore do not specifically assess psychosis.

However, it has highlighted the difficulties in attempting to design and conduct such a placebo-controlled trial in a clinically meaningful and pragmatic manner. A significant impediment to performing the trial was the difficulty in quantifying clinically significant changes in symptom severity due to fluctuation of symptoms and the lack of a validated scale. Recruitment into the trial was slow due to safety concerns regarding the use of atypical antipsychotics in the elderly. In addition the doses of quetiapine used in the study were rather low which may have prevented any demonstration of antipsychotic effect. The effective treatment of psychosis in PD is still an urgent clinical need.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21385" xml_f="21488" txt_i="15809" txt_f="15912">The absence of an effect of quetiapine on motor functioning was noted, as has been previously reported.</offsets><xref rid="b14-ndt-5-327" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="21530" xml_f="21532" txt_i="15912" txt_f="15914">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21539" xml_f="21540" txt_i="15914" txt_f="15915">–</offsets><xref rid="b16-ndt-5-327" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="21582" xml_f="21584" txt_i="15915" txt_f="15917">16</offsets></xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Dr Chris Clough, Dr Robert Weeks and Professor Ray Chaudhuri, King’s College Hospital; Clare Rutterford and Caroline Murphy, Institute of Psychiatry; Rosemary Vahid, Michelle McHenry (Parkinson’s Disease Nurses), East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust; Dr Neil Munro, Dr Jonothan Hawkins, Dr Michael Jenkinson and Dr Andrew Heller, East Kent Hospitals Trust.
