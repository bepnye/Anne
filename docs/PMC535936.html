Although this structure has many advantages, it is difficult to provide a consistent educational experience for the students. To help address this challenge, we implemented an all-day lecture series held at one of the community campuses two weeks before the end of the internal medicine clerkship.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5884" xml_f="6405" txt_i="2200" txt_f="2721">The students and faculty presenters from other campuses traveled from their home campus to the campus hosting the lecture series. End-of-clerkship feedback from the students has indicated the lecture series is both valuable and well received. Traveling to the host community, however, was inconvenient and time consuming for both students and faculty presenters. In addition, it is not practical for students at our rural medicine campus to attend due to the distance (approximately 400 miles) from the other communities.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6412" xml_f="6633" txt_i="2722" txt_f="2943">There is evidence that delivering the audio from a lecture in combination with the presenter's slides can be an effective means of delivering lectures at remote sites, and may even be as effective as traditional lectures[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="6664" xml_f="6665" txt_i="2943" txt_f="2944">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6672" xml_f="6673" txt_i="2944" txt_f="2945">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="6704" xml_f="6705" txt_i="2945" txt_f="2946">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6712" xml_f="7868" txt_i="2946" txt_f="4102">]. We saw this as a potential solution for providing a consistent didactic curriculum in our clerkship. With the availability of inexpensive, high quality digital camcorders and software for merging audiovisual material with presentation slides, we felt including video of the presenter as well as audio from a live lecture in combination with the presenter's slides might result in a more engaging and hence more effective presentation than audio alone. During the 2003–2004 academic year, we conducted a randomized trial comparing attending the lecture series with viewing a CD-ROM-based multimedia version of the same lecture series. If the digital lectures could help students master the material at the same or similar level of understanding as live lectures, they could potentially replace the live lectures and thereby save the time lost to travel for both the students and faculty presenters. Additionally, the digital lectures would provide the same instructional opportunities for students in our rural medicine program as students in our other campuses and provide all our students the opportunity to view the presentations at their convenience.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="7909" xml_f="7916" txt_i="4104" txt_f="4111">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7927" xml_f="8826" txt_i="4112" txt_f="5011">Students taking the third-year required internal medicine clerkship during the 2003–2004 academic year at our institution were offered the opportunity to participate in the study. Those agreeing to participate were randomized into to one of two arms of the study. The random assignment of students to the two arms of the study was done within each community to control for the potential of community differences. The control group traveled to the host community campus and attended the live lectures with their colleagues who chose not to participate in the study. The experimental group stayed at their home campus on the same day and completed a parallel set of CD-ROM-based multimedia modules made from digital recordings of the previous year's lectures. They completed these digital lectures in computer laboratories in either the community campus office or within one of the teaching hospitals.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8833" xml_f="9218" txt_i="5012" txt_f="5397">The series included six lectures covering asthma, coronary artery disease (CAD), acute renal failure, liver disease, thyroid disease, and antibiotic pharmacology.

Two of the lectures, CAD and renal failure, were not modified and kept as consistent as possible with the previous year in order to conduct the study. Though there might have been minor inconsistencies between the digital and live versions of these two lectures, the same faculty member presented each lecture during both the 2002–2003 academic year when the lectures were taped and the 2003–2004 academic year when presented live. The two lecturers also attempted to keep the live lectures as consistent as possible with the digital lectures and used the same slides that they had used the previous year.

These questions were written by the presenters of the lectures and designed to assess student mastery of the lectures' key objectives. The students were informed that the purpose of the examination was to provide them with feedback on the mastery of the material and the presenters with feedback on the effectiveness of the lectures, and would not impact on their clerkship grade. After the students completed the exam, they were given a copy that included the correct answers and a short explanation for the correct answer. The exam forms contained no student identifiers, but students in the control group were asked to indicate on the examination form that they had agreed to participate in the study so they could be differentiated from the students who had chosen not to participate in the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11219" xml_f="11716" txt_i="7342" txt_f="7839">Students in the experimental arm of the study completed the same examination in their home community after they had completed the digital lectures.

These included six students from the rural medicine program at Marquette who do not participate in the live lecture series due to the distance from the other communities. Additionally, some of the communities conducted a fourth rotation of the internal medicine clerkship due to space limitations in the three regular rotations and a live version of the lecture series was not given for the students in the fourth rotation.

The standard deviation in the scores was twice as large for the students who completed the digital modules. The differences in the dispersion are also evident in the range of values in each group. It is not clear why there was more variation in the scores among the students who completed the digital modules. It may be related to the technical problems encountered by many of the students in accessing the modules, though one would expect this would have resulting in extending the lower tail of the distribution but not the upper tail.

They were particularly appreciative of not having to travel to another community to attend didactic presentations and having the flexibility of viewing the modules at their convenience. Of the three potential disadvantages of the format that were listed on the feedback form, they felt their inability to ask a question of the presenter was the most important.

Additionally, we switched the video formats from MPEG to Windows media files. We assumed there would be less compatibility problems with the Windows media files given that this is a format developed by Microsoft. Unfortunately, we later found out the Windows media files require software that was not shipped with earlier versions of Windows.

It also increased the likelihood the two groups of students were not equivalent. Since there were no student identifiers on the exams, it was not possible to compare the characteristics of the two groups. The outcome measure was a locally developed test. While the items were written by the presenters and based on the major objectives in their lectures, there was no assessment of validity other than content validity. It is also not clear the extent the findings of this study can be generalized to other digital lecture formats.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="27206" xml_f="27217" txt_i="19613" txt_f="19624">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27228" xml_f="27457" txt_i="19625" txt_f="19854">Although the data collected in this study were limited, it provides some evidence that digital lectures are both well received by students and can provide a satisfactory substitute for live lectures from a performance standpoint.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="27479" xml_f="27498" txt_i="19856" txt_f="19875">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27509" xml_f="27569" txt_i="19876" txt_f="19936">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="27591" xml_f="27613" txt_i="19938" txt_f="19960">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27624" xml_f="27924" txt_i="19961" txt_f="20261">DJS designed the study, developed the feedback instrument on for the digital modules conducted the statistical analyses and wrote the first draft of the paper.
