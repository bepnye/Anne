However, evidence for effect is lacking. Obesity is a growing problem, resulting in an increasing demand for cost efficient weight loss programs suitable for use on a large scale, for example, as part of standard primary care. In a previous pilot project by Brandt et al. (2011) without a control group, we examined the effects of online dietician counseling and found an average weight loss of 7.0 kg (95% CI: 4.6 to 9.3 kg) after 20 months. </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5241" xml_f="5258" txt_i="596" txt_f="613">Aims and Methods.</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5267" xml_f="5885" txt_i="613" txt_f="1231"> To analyze the effects of a complex intervention using trained dieticians in a general practice setting combined with internet-based interactive and personalized weight management support compared with conventional advice with a noninteractive internet support as placebo treatment in 340 overweight patients during a 2-year period.

The most active quartile will be compared to the least active quartile in relation to weight loss, and other measured parameters. If the difference in sustained weight loss after 2 years is greater than 2.5 kg, the planned total of 340 patients will allow analyses of interactions between treatment, gender, age and obesity level.

The guiding principle was to improve the cost-effectiveness of established best practice for dietician-supported weight management by using the internet to facilitate interactive communication between the dieticians and the users as well as among the users (peer support through online community). This program was developed iteratively from an initial prototype through trial and error to what is now a well-established commercial product used by 10.000 predominantly healthy overweight or moderately obese users in 2013. Regarding the use in general practice for treatment of obese patients, this program has been tried on a pilot scale with good results [</offsets><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="21948" xml_f="21950" txt_i="14780" txt_f="14782">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21957" xml_f="22128" txt_i="14782" txt_f="14953">].

In most cases this support (“usual care”) consists of 4–6 monthly face-to-face consultations with a health professional, usually a nurse or physician, which includes provision of general weight management information such as brochures and educational internet sites. So the present study has been designed to allow direct comparison between the intervention (dietician-supported internet community) and a single-blind control treatment. The two arms provide the same number of face-to-face consultations which include the sessions to measure and sample the patients. The usual care control treatment will be provided in a way so the patients are not aware which arm they are on by using a placebo website that superficially resembles the interactive treatment without providing any personalized support. This study will utilize the Danish general practice setting, where it is possible to test the combination of face-to-face consultations with dieticians (establishing the relation), real-time online reporting, life style advice, and community peer support as a full scale trial. The online tool in this study will be integrated into the exiting electronic journal system of the general practitioners to emulate how it would be implemented if it was part of the standard offer.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23669" xml_f="24077" txt_i="16482" txt_f="16890">Additional information will be collected from patients and health professionals as feedback to enable further improvements, primarily regarding how to optimize the experience for both patients and health professionals as well as how to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from this type of intervention, in order to optimize resource allocation to this and other options for weight management.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24084" xml_f="24699" txt_i="16891" txt_f="17506">A potential limitation to the chosen study design is that the number of doctors recruited is limited and those who take part might be more interested in new technologies than the average general practitioner. Another weakness of the present study is that the intervention comprises several dimensions of complexity, which preclude evaluation of each aspect of the intervention separately. However, with this new technology doctors will be able to prescribe exercise and diets and obtain insight into patient performance at a much more detailed level than seen before.

If the study is successful, this will make it easy to implement the program nationwide and internationally for the benefit of many overweight patients.
