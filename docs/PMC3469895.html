To assess the caries experience, the decayed, extracted due to caries, and filled primary teeth (deft) index was used. A tooth was diagnosed as decayed (“d” component) if its color was changed and there was any evidence of cavitated or noncavitated dental primary caries or recurrent caries adjacent to already filled teeth. The “e” component included extracted teeth and decayed teeth indicated for extraction due to caries, and the “f” component included restored teeth without caries. White spots were not considered as decayed. It was not practical to take radiographs.
