In this RCT conducted in a real-life primary care setting, health coaching improved the QoL of T2D and CAD patients with moderate costs in the short-term follow-up. The results of our study suggest that health coaching should be targeted to selected patient groups. However, the follow-up period was probably too short to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of health-coaching intervention and a long-term evaluation is needed.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>APR</term><def><p>Ambulatory and primary care related patient group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAD</term><def><p>Coronary artery disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEAC</term><def><p>Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHF</term><def><p>Congestive heart failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DRG</term><def><p>Diagnosis-related groups</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EU</term><def><p>European Union</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EVO</term><def><p>Special state funding</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HbA1c</term><def><p>Glycated hemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HDL</term><def><p>High density lipoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HILMO</term><def><p>National discharge registry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p>Health related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICD-10</term><def><p>Classification of disease 10<sup>th</sup> revision</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>Incremental cost-effectiveness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICPC-2</term><def><p>Reason for encounter patient administration system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDL</term><def><p>Low density lipoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCSP</term><def><p>Nordic classification of Surgical Procedures</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NYHA</term><def><p>New York heart association index on angina pectoris</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAS</term><def><p>Patient administration system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>Quality adjusted life years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Sos.
