Confidence in their ability to make good F&amp;V choices, to prepare F&amp;V so they are nutritional and appetizing, and their ability to select good tasting F&amp;V, were also assessed. OE regarding the benefits of consuming F&amp;V were assessed with four questions evaluated on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from not at all likely to extremely likely. Questions evaluated participants' thoughts on the likelihood of whether or not F&amp;V consumption would reduce their risk of cancer, improve overall health, reduce risk of heart disease, and help maintain or lose weight.
