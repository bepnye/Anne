It is no contradiction that after 10 days there was no longer a significant difference between propolis and aciclovir lip balm: episodes of herpes labialis are self-limiting conditions and would normally be expected to heal within 10 to 14 days, if left untreated. The aim of a medication is to shorten this period, and a shortening of the herpes episode was demonstrated for both aciclovir and propolis extract.</offsets></p><p id="p0185"><offsets xml_i="29274" xml_f="30195" txt_i="21164" txt_f="22085">The lack of a placebo control might be considered a downside of the study protocol. However, the efficacy of aciclovir in the tested concentration is generally accepted as proven, and can also be derived from the outcome of this study. In the Czech Republic, where this study was performed, the use of placebo is considered ethically unacceptable when there is a reference treatment with accepted efficacy. The dosing of aciclovir corresponded to a dose accepted as efficacious. The worst-case imputation method for missing values would be in favor of aciclovir. The median and average time to complete encrustation or epithelialization was approximately 1 day shorter in the propolis group than in the aciclovir group, which underlines the clinical importance of the findings beyond statistical significance. In addition, a higher proportion of patients in the propolis group skipped the vesicular and the erosive stage.</offsets></p><p id="p0190"><offsets xml_i="30213" xml_f="30466" txt_i="22086" txt_f="22339">The measured advantage of the study preparation over the reference population with respect to pain reduction, reaching 8 mm on the VAS at mid study, was considered of borderline clinical importance.

In this study, all patients were in the papular or erythematous stage. The findings are therefore applicable to the early stages of a herpes episode. We are already examining the question of whether the advantages of propolis over aciclovir are still visible if lip balm is first applied when patients are already in the vesicular stage.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s0100"><title><offsets xml_i="31350" xml_f="31371" txt_i="23058" txt_f="23079">Conflicts of Interest</offsets></title><p id="p0200"><offsets xml_i="31393" xml_f="32053" txt_i="23080" txt_f="23740">This clinical study was supported by funds from the companies Harras Pharma Curarina GmbH (Munich, Germany; applicant for the marketing authorization of the study preparation) and Gehrlicher Pharmazeutische Extrakte GmbH (Eurasburg, Germany; manufacturer of the study preparation).
