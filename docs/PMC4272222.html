The controller base has a graphic user interface screen that facilitates patient training by the nurse and displays setup instructions and system data for authorized health care professionals.

All patients provided written informed consent before undergoing any study procedures. Male and nonpregnant female patients were eligible for inclusion if they were at least 18 years old, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to III, and scheduled to undergo open abdominal surgery (including open abdominal surgeries that were laparoscopic assisted, such as partial colectomies) under general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia that did not include intrathecal opioids. Fully laparoscopic surgeries were not included. Patients were excluded if they were opioid tolerant (use of &gt;15 mg oral morphine equivalent per day within the past 3 months); had documented sleep apnea, alcohol or drug abuse, or a need for outpatient oxygen therapy; or had any medical condition that would interfere with pain assessments.

Pain intensity was based on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain. When these conditions were met and the patient requested medication for pain, baseline vital signs, oxygen saturation, and pain intensity were assessed before the patient self-administered the first dose of study drug. The SSTS or placebo system was used for 48 hours because that is the typical duration of use for IV PCA following surgery. If patients continued to require strong opioid analgesia following 48 hours, then sites had the option to extend the study up to 72 hours; however, a completer was considered any patient finishing 48 hours in the study.

Pain intensity and pain relief scores were also obtained just prior to IV morphine dosing for inadequate analgesia. The primary efficacy end point was the time-weighted summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 48 hours (SPID48). This cumulative pain intensity measure is recommended by regulatory agencies to demonstrate the efficacy of acute pain products. Secondary efficacy end points included SPID at each evaluation time point; total pain relief (TOTPAR), pain intensity difference (PID), and pain relief at each evaluation time point; the proportion of patients discontinuing the study or requiring additional opioid medication due to inadequate analgesia; and the patient global assessment (PGA) and health care professional global assessment (HPGA) of method of pain control at 24, 48, and 72 hours.

Given the nature of a placebo-controlled study, where factors that will increase the placebo-response rate are purposely diminished (eg, no adjuvant analgesics or local anesthetic field blocks) and patients are unsure if they are receiving active study drug and may tend to drop out to guarantee access to analgesics, this rate of dropout from the active group is also neither surprising nor uncommon for large phase 3 placebo-controlled analgesic studies.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33407" xml_f="34147" txt_i="25661" txt_f="26401">Patient and health care professional global assessments as well as the EOC questionnaire ratings all demonstrate that both patients and health care providers found the system to provide adequate analgesia with a user-friendly device. Regardless of whether patients were randomized to active or placebo, scores on ease of use of the system were high, with the exception of pain relief, which appropriately was lower in the placebo system group. In an open-label, randomized study of SSTS compared with IV PCA morphine in patients following either open abdominal surgery or major joint replacement surgery, patient and nurse EOC scores were higher for the SSTS compared with IV PCA for both the total EOC score as well as each subscale score.</offsets><sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34186" xml_f="34188" txt_i="26401" txt_f="26403">14</offsets></xref></sup></p><p><offsets xml_i="34208" xml_f="34706" txt_i="26404" txt_f="26902">The safety and tolerability of the SSTS were measured using standard adverse event reporting and vital sign measurements. There were no differences for related adverse events or changes in vital signs between active and placebo groups. To reflect the real-world surgical population, the protocol did not limit enrollment by age or body mass index, resulting in more than a quarter of the patients ranging from 65 to 92 years of age and 44% of the population rated as obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/m</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="34711" xml_f="34712" txt_i="26902" txt_f="26903">2</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="34718" xml_f="35353" txt_i="26903" txt_f="27538">). The similar safety profile of SSTS compared with placebo is encouraging for the use of this product in postoperative patients who often present with multiple comorbidities. Furthermore, there is an inherent additional safety factor in a system that cannot have a prescribing or programming error as the result of a fixed-dose, fixed-lockout paradigm, as well as having a noninvasive route of administration. These phase 3 study data are in agreement with earlier phase 2 dose-finding studies, which demonstrated an adverse event profile similar to placebo with only pruritus statistically higher in the active versus placebo groups.</offsets><sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="35391" xml_f="35392" txt_i="27538" txt_f="27539">7</offsets></xref></sup></p><p><offsets xml_i="35412" xml_f="35917" txt_i="27540" txt_f="28045">The slightly higher number of enrolled patients 65 years or older and female patients in the placebo group could possibly have affected the adverse event profile in this group. The “as-needed” dosing of both the SSTS and the rescue IV morphine is specifically to allow tailoring of the drug dose for individual patient’s analgesic requirements, thereby adjusting for any demographic influence. However, we cannot fully dismiss that these demographic variables could have impacted the results of the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35924" xml_f="36655" txt_i="28046" txt_f="28777">The SSTS contains a number of security features, including a patient-specific RFID technology to minimize “proxy” dosing, which is an advantage over traditional IV PCA, which can allow family members to dose the patient, resulting in adverse events. Other features include a security tether, a tamper-resistant drug cartridge to limit health care worker diversion, and an electronic tablet count on both the dispensing device and the cartridge RFID label, which can be reconciled to identify possible diversion. Although health care providers should be observant for patient diversion of medication, this issue in hospitalized patients is limited compared with the much larger problem of diversion of outpatient-prescribed opioids.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36662" xml_f="37173" txt_i="28778" txt_f="29289">In summary, the SSTS is an investigational patient-administered opioid system for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in a hospital setting. The system is preprogrammed and noninvasive, overcoming some of the issues with IV PCA, and results from this study suggest it is an effective analgesic treatment for patients following major abdominal surgery and possesses an encouraging safety profile that would integrate well within a multimodal approach to acute pain management in the hospital setting.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, the study sponsor, thanks the study subjects, PharmaNet/i3, a subsidiary of inVentiv Health Clinical, the research coordinators, and the investigators for their contribution.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding was received from AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Redwood City, CA.</p></fn><fn fn-type="presented-at"><p>These data were previously presented in part as a poster at 2013 spring and fall meetings of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the 2013 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Annual Meeting, and the 2013 ASA Postgraduate Assembly Annual Meeting</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>H.S.M. received honoraria and research funding; F.G.R., T.J.G., and K.A.A. have received research funding; Y.C. is a paid consultant and M.A.E. and P.P.P. are employees of AcelRx.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
