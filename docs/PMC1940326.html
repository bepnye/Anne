Over nine months follow-up in our original study, there was no evidence that FFM ME-TRAP provided protection against malaria. The incidence of malaria was slightly higher in children who received FFM ME-TRAP, but this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.3).

The primary analysis was time to parasitaemia &gt;2,500/µl. During the second nine months monitoring, 49 events met the primary endpoint (febrile malaria with parasites &gt;2,500/µl) in the Intention To Treat (ITT) group. 23 events occurred among the 189 children in the FFM ME-TRAP group, and 26 among the 194 children in the control group.

Measures were taken to reduce the impact of this on the integrity of the study; an investigator not involved in the primary analysis oversaw the second 9 months of monitoring, and blood films were read in the laboratory with reference to only study subject numbers without knowledge of vaccination group. The lead investigator who had conducted the primary analysis was not involved in continued follow up, and conducted the analysis presented here after being sent a cleaned database. That no efficacy was seen on the primary analysis was communicated to study participants, and so vaccine allocation was perhaps unlikely to bias health seeking behaviour. A similar number of follow up visits were completed among children allocated to either vaccination (4,958 visits among FFM ME-TRAP vaccinees vs 5,130 among controls), and a similar number presented for assessment of fever between visits (1,086 among FFM ME-TRAP vaccinees vs 1,095 among controls), p = 0.58).

However, there was no indication that higher T cell responses predicted greater susceptibility to malaria, suggesting that there was not a causal link, and the increase in risk was not significant during primary analysis </offsets><xref rid="pone.0000707-Bejon1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="27565" xml_f="27568" txt_i="16376" txt_f="16379">[4]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27575" xml_f="27892" txt_i="16379" txt_f="16696">. The convergence of Incidence Rates and Hazards seen during the second 9 months of monitoring provides further reassurance. Since the vaccinated children are now aged 3–8 years, and the incidence of malaria is expected to be lower still, continued analysis of episodes of malaria by vaccination group is not planned.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title><offsets xml_i="27962" xml_f="27984" txt_i="16699" txt_f="16721">Supporting Information</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000707.s001"><label><offsets xml_i="28072" xml_f="28083" txt_i="16722" txt_f="16733">Protocol S1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="28103" xml_f="28164" txt_i="16733" txt_f="16794">Protocol Under Which Further 9 Months Follow up was Conducted</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28171" xml_f="28184" txt_i="16795" txt_f="16808">(4.42 MB PDF)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000707.s001.pdf"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="28252" xml_f="28288" txt_i="16809" txt_f="16845">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000707.s002"><label><offsets xml_i="28415" xml_f="28426" txt_i="16846" txt_f="16857">Protocol S2</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="28446" xml_f="28472" txt_i="16857" txt_f="16883">Protocol for ongoing study</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28479" xml_f="28492" txt_i="16884" txt_f="16897">(4.42 MB DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000707.s002.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="28560" xml_f="28596" txt_i="16898" txt_f="16934">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000707.s003"><label><offsets xml_i="28723" xml_f="28734" txt_i="16935" txt_f="16946">Protocol S3</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="28754" xml_f="28771" txt_i="16946" txt_f="16963">Original protocol</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28778" xml_f="28791" txt_i="16964" txt_f="16977">(0.31 MB DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000707.s003.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="28859" xml_f="28895" txt_i="16978" txt_f="17014">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000707.s004"><label><offsets xml_i="29022" xml_f="29038" txt_i="17015" txt_f="17031">Analysis Plan S1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="29058" xml_f="29101" txt_i="17031" txt_f="17074">Analysis Plan for second 9 months follow up</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29108" xml_f="29121" txt_i="17075" txt_f="17088">(0.03 MB DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000707.s004.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="29189" xml_f="29225" txt_i="17089" txt_f="17125">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000707.s005"><label><offsets xml_i="29352" xml_f="29364" txt_i="17126" txt_f="17138">Checklist S1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="29384" xml_f="29401" txt_i="17138" txt_f="17155">CONSORT checklist</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29408" xml_f="29421" txt_i="17156" txt_f="17169">(0.05 MB DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000707.s005.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="29489" xml_f="29525" txt_i="17170" txt_f="17206">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The participants and their parents are thanked.
