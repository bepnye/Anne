Calves with spontaneously derived diarrhoea were treated with either the homeopathic remedy Podophyllum (D30) (n = 24) or a placebo (n = 20). No clinically or statistically significant difference between the 2 groups was demonstrated. Calves treated with Podophyllum had an average of 3.1 days of diarrhoea compared with 2.9 days for the placebo group. Depression, inappetence and fever were presented equally in the 2 groups. These results support the widely held opinion that scientific proof for the efficacy of veterinary homeopathy is lacking. In the European Union this implies a considerable risk for animal welfare, since in some countries priority is given to homeopathic treatments in organic farming.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Antibiotics</kwd><kwd>bovine</kwd><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>Cryptosporidium</kwd><kwd>enteritis</kwd><kwd>homeopathy</kwd><kwd>medicine</kwd><kwd>organic farming</kwd><kwd>Podophyllum</kwd><kwd>rotavirus</kwd><kwd>scour</kwd><kwd>veterinary</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="3520" xml_f="3532" txt_i="883" txt_f="895">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3543" xml_f="3675" txt_i="896" txt_f="1028">Acute undifferentiated diarrhoea in young calves (neonatal calf diarrhoea) is a daily occurrence all over the world, and rotavirus, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="3683" xml_f="3706" txt_i="1028" txt_f="1051">Cryptosporidium parvum </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="3715" xml_f="3761" txt_i="1051" txt_f="1097">and coronavirus are major aetiological agents.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="3768" xml_f="4360" txt_i="1098" txt_f="1690">In the European Union, veterinary homeopathy is in common use in field practice, including for calf diarrhoea, and in some countries is increasing in popularity.

A comparison between calves up to 2 weeks of age and calves older than 6 weeks showed that depression, inappetence and fever were present more frequently in the youngest animals.
