We enrolled patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome who presented at these hospitals. Eligible patients were at least 16 years old, had hip pain with radiographic features of cam or pincer morphology but no osteoarthritis, and were believed to be likely to benefit from hip arthroscopy. Patients with bilateral femoroacetabular impingement syndrome were eligible; only the most symptomatic hip was randomly assigned to treatment and followed-up. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy (an individualised, supervised, and progressive physiotherapist-led programme of conservative care). Randomisation was stratified by impingement type and recruiting centre and was done by research staff at each hospital, using a central telephone randomisation service. Patients and treating clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation, but researchers who collected the outcome assessments and analysed the results were masked. The primary outcome was hip-related quality of life, as measured by the patient-reported International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33) 12 months after randomisation, and analysed in all eligible participants who were allocated to treatment (the intention-to-treat population). This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN64081839, and is closed to recruitment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20547" xml_f="20555" txt_i="1889" txt_f="1897">Findings</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20566" xml_f="21768" txt_i="1898" txt_f="3100">Between July 20, 2012, and July 15, 2016, we identified 648 eligible patients and recruited 348 participants: 171 participants were allocated to receive hip arthroscopy and 177 to receive personalised hip therapy. Three further patients were excluded from the trial after randomisation because they did not meet the eligibility criteria. Follow-up at the primary outcome assessment was 92% (319 of 348 participants). At 12 months after randomisation, mean iHOT-33 scores had improved from 39·2 (SD 20·9) to 58·8 (27·2) for participants in the hip arthroscopy group, and from 35·6 (18·2) to 49·7 (25·5) in the personalised hip therapy group. In the primary analysis, the mean difference in iHOT-33 scores, adjusted for impingement type, sex, baseline iHOT-33 score, and centre, was 6·8 (95% CI 1·7–12·0) in favour of hip arthroscopy (p=0·0093). This estimate of treatment effect exceeded the minimum clinically important difference (6·1 points). There were 147 patient-reported adverse events (in 100 [72%] of 138 patients) in the hip arthroscopy group) versus 102 events (in 88 [60%] of 146 patients) in the personalised hip therapy group, with muscle soreness being the most common of these (58 [42%] </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="21776" xml_f="21778" txt_i="3100" txt_f="3102">vs</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="21787" xml_f="22163" txt_i="3102" txt_f="3478"> 69 [47%]). There were seven serious adverse events reported by participating hospitals. Five (83%) of six serious adverse events in the hip arthroscopy group were related to treatment, and the one in the personalised hip therapy group was not.

It is caused by symptomatic premature contact between the proximal femur and acetabular rim during hip motion, and this phenomenon is associated with certain hip shapes. Repeated impingement leads to damage to the articular cartilage or to acetabular labral tears, and it is these injuries that are thought to be painful. In the past decade, surgeons have developed arthroscopic (ie, keyhole) surgical techniques to treat femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. The rationale is that reshaping the hip and repairing cartilage and labral damage will prevent impingement and relieve symptoms. In 2013, we did a Cochrane systematic review of the effectiveness of hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. We searched MEDLINE (from 1946 to Nov 19, 2013), Embase (1980 to Nov 19, 2013), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (issue 11, 2013), for randomised controlled trials of surgery compared with placebo treatment, non-operative treatment, or no treatment, in any language, in human adults with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. We found no high-quality evidence examining the effectiveness of surgery for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. Therefore, we chose to do a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of hip arthroscopy compared with best conservative care.</offsets></p><p id="para50"><bold><offsets xml_i="25536" xml_f="25561" txt_i="6240" txt_f="6265">Added value of this study</offsets></bold></p><p id="para60"><offsets xml_i="25587" xml_f="26208" txt_i="6266" txt_f="6887">To our knowledge, this is the largest randomised controlled trial to show the clinical effectiveness of hip arthroscopy in treating femoroacetabular impingement syndrome.

The large number of centres (n=23), surgeons (n=27), and physiotherapists (n=43) involved is a strength, which contributes to the generalisability of our findings.

A blinded allocation trial, with a placebo control, would have been better suited to measuring the underlying effect of surgery. In our trial, the research question was whether hip arthroscopy or best conservative care was the most effective treatment strategy, leading to an inevitable absence of blinding. Data collection and analysis were done without revealing treatment allocation. An unexpected difficulty was the frequent delay in delivery of surgery for those patients allocated to hip arthroscopy. We had anticipated that this delay would be less than 3 months in most patients because when we designed the trial, there was a strongly enforced NHS target to treat patients within 18 weeks from referral to surgery. In fact, during the study, this target was a challenge in many hospitals. Patients allocated to hip arthroscopy therefore often had longer times to treatment, and because the primary outcome was measured 12 months after randomisation, these patients were often still within a few months (and in some cases a few weeks) of their operation when we measured the primary outcome. Because of these delays, patients in the hip arthroscopy group had, on average, less time to recover before the primary outcome measurement than did patients in the personalised hip therapy group. We compared the outcome of hip arthroscopy participants who had surgery in the first 6 months after randomisation with those who had surgery in the second 6 months. There was no significant difference between these groups, suggesting that the systematic difference in time to treatment between groups does not account for the treatment effect. Our inferences about the effectiveness of hip arthroscopy compared with personalised hip therapy are limited to data collected 12 months after randomisation; long-term follow-up is required to establish if this effect is maintained and if further treatments are required.</offsets></p><p id="para430"><offsets xml_i="74296" xml_f="74858" txt_i="42839" txt_f="43401">The fact that not all surgery or personalised hip therapy was deemed to be of a high fidelity is also a reflection of the real-world setting in which this trial was done. Some surgery was not satisfactory, and some participants allocated to personalised hip therapy did not engage with it or complete it: our fidelity assessment showed high-fidelity treatment in 87% of patients receiving hip arthroscopy and 70% of patients receiving personalised hip therapy. However, these proportions are comparable with other studies and reflect the pragmatism of our trial.</offsets><xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="74897" xml_f="74899" txt_i="43401" txt_f="43403">31</offsets></sup></xref><offsets xml_i="74912" xml_f="75452" txt_i="43403" txt_f="43943"> We took great effort to minimise crossover in our trial, using techniques developed in our feasibility study. No participants allocated to receive hip arthroscopy received personalised hip therapy; 14 participants allocated to personalised hip therapy subsequently changed their mind and decided to have surgery within 12 months. We do not believe that these crossovers can account for the results of this trial; indeed, we would expect such crossovers to dilute and so reduce our estimate of the real underlying effect of hip arthroscopy.</offsets></p><p id="para440"><offsets xml_i="75472" xml_f="76755" txt_i="43944" txt_f="45227">Personalised hip therapy is believed to work by improving muscle control, strength around the hip, and movement patterns, leading to the avoidance of hip impingement. Surgery is thought to work by reshaping the bone to prevent impingement and by treating painful injuries to articular cartilage and labrum. In our trial, the observed effect of hip arthroscopy over conservative care might be attributable to the surgical procedure, the placebo effect of surgery (given the unblinded nature of this trial), post-surgical rehabilitation, or a combination of these factors. The results of our subgroup analysis of patients with only cam morphology are suggestive of an increased treatment effect of hip arthroscopy compared with other shapes. This finding would support the idea that the removal of a cam shape has a specific therapeutic effect. The low number of patients with pincer or mixed cam and pincer morphology in this study means we are less certain about the influence of reshaping the acetabular rim. Ultimately, we do not fully understand the mechanism of benefit from hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy. Future research should focus on investigating these mechanisms further, and which patients would benefit most from hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy.</offsets></p><p id="para450"><offsets xml_i="76775" xml_f="77138" txt_i="45228" txt_f="45591">We have shown that offering hip arthroscopy to patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome led to better patient-assessed function 12 months after randomisation, compared with best conservative care.

participated in the trial. We are grateful to the members of the trial steering committee, data monitoring and safety committee, and members of the UK FASHIoN Study Group for their contributions to this study. UK FASHIoN was jointly sponsored by the University of Warwick and the University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust. This work is supported by the Health Technology Assessment Programme of the NIHR (feasibility and pilot trial grant number 10/41/02, full trial grant number 13/103/02). The UK Comprehensive Research Network also supported this trial. JLD is supported by the MRC ConDuCT Hub for Trials Methodology Research (MR/K025643/1), and the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) West at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, and is an NIHR Senior Investigator (NF-SI-0507-10213). SP is an NIHR Senior Investigator (NF-SI-0616-10103). NEF is an NIHR Senior Investigator, and was supported through an NIHR Research Professorship (NIHR-RP-011-015). This project benefited from facilities funded through Birmingham Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure Trials Platform, with support from Advantage West Midlands and the Wolfson Foundation.

DRG was the chief investigator. NEF and PDHW led development of personalised hip therapy intervention, and NEF, JS, and EJD supported participating physiotherapists in its delivery. EJD and RH were responsible for administrative set-up and performance of the trial, and centre staff training. CEH and EJD were responsible for collating and analysing the radiological data. NRP and JG provided statistical input to design, performance, and analysis of the trial. SP and FA designed and did the health economic analysis. AR, MJ, and JLD did the qualitative research recruitment intervention. DRG, JG, and NRP had access to all study data. DRG drafted the final report; all of the FASHIoN investigators have been involved in revising the report, and all of the authors have seen and approved the final version. DRG is the guarantor for this study and decided to submit the manuscript.</p></ack><ack><title>Trial steering committee</title><p>Ashley Blom (chair), Richard Villar, Alan Girling, Jeremy Fry, David Ralph, Ceri Jones, and Graham Hewitt.</p></ack><ack><title>Data monitoring committee</title><p>Lee Shepstone (chair), Simon Donell, and Nicholas Mohtadi.</p></ack><ack><title>UK FASHIoN Study Group</title></ack><ack><title>Administrative staff: Siobhan Stevens, Elke Gemperle-Mannion, and Jaclyn Brown (Warwick Clinical Trials Unit).
