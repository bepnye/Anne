The workshop, presented by two teaching faculty members (MM and KM), was held during the usual time of the weekly academic half-day. The workshop was designed to focus on strategies for effective presentation of the morning report. Specifically, instruction was provided in six areas: choosing learning objectives; selecting content; identifying key teaching points; delivering content effectively; engaging the audience; and continuing learning after the teaching session has finished. The workshop began with a brainstorming session on 'what went wrong' and 'what went right' during a teaching session in which participants were asked to identify reasons why teaching sessions that they gave or witnesses succeeded or otherwise. Following this participants were divided into four groups and each group was given a teaching scenario.

After the small group presentations the faculty described ways of using reflection and feedback to improve teaching.

The nature of the interventions is shown in the figure below. Not shown in this figure is, however, another important component of a successful outcome; willingness to change. The audience of senior medical residents all had previous experience of presenting morning report, some of which was negative, and appeared motivated to change by virtue of 90% attendance at an optional workshop. Thus we believed this group to be already predisposed and receptive to an intervention designed to change behaviour and were already some way along the path to change, e.g., at the contemplative or preparation stage. It is not possible with the design of our study to identify the relative contribution of the individual components to the overall success of the intervention. We did not set out to compare the individual components as it was our belief that they could not be considered as independent, e.g., the success of the reinforcing intervention is dependent upon the success of the preceding interventions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17488" xml_f="19229" txt_i="13323" txt_f="15064">While the intervention appeared to have positive results from the viewpoint of the audience, there were mixed results on the self perceived challenges and competencies of residents presenting morning report. After the intervention resident teachers scored their competencies in engaging the audience lower. This perception of failure to engage the audience was, however, countered by the audience's perception of the teaching sessions being more interactive i.e., they felt more engaged. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear but, anecdotally, may relate to the fact that most of the post-session feedback involved ways of making the rounds more interactive. This aspect of the intervention may have changed the resident's perception of their performance towards that of the feedback...;'if they keep telling me about ways of making the rounds interactive then I must be doing a bad job at engaging the audience'. Changing the nature of the feedback could test this hypothesis. After the intervention resident teachers also scored their medical knowledge lower. Once again this was an unexpected result and may have been introduced by simply having a session on morning report such that residents feel more scrutinized. Perhaps a more likely explanation is that by reducing anxiety about content selection and delivery, resident teachers became more aware of potential deficiencies in the knowledge base. Reassuringly, the objective information collected for each year of residency shows that residents in our program actually increase their medical knowledge with time. Irrespective of the explanation for the discrepant results they highlight the importance of evaluating the impact of such interventions from more than one aspect [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><offsets xml_i="19261" xml_f="19263" txt_i="15064" txt_f="15066">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19270" xml_f="19272" txt_i="15066" txt_f="15068">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19279" xml_f="20767" txt_i="15069" txt_f="16557">There are some important limitations to our study. Our sample size, despite high enrolment of available residents and students, was small by virtue of this being a single centre study. Conducting this study in several centres would increase the precision of our results although this might also introduce greater variability in the nature of the delivered intervention. In this study we did not have a control group, a decision made based upon the small sample size. It could be argued, therefore, that the changed perceptions observed occurred merely as a result of time and increased experience in presentation, or were due to some other unforeseen intervention. Reassuringly, there were no format changes made to the morning report sessions and no other educational interventions for residents over the course of this study. Repeating this study and involving a second centre to either serve as a control group or to increase the numbers such that a randomized controlled trial were possible would be one way of addressing this limitation. A third limitation is the fact that the effect sizes for the observed changes were, for the most part, small to medium. It is worth noting however, that the levels of satisfaction with the morning report sessions were high prior to the intervention. Consequently, it should be expected that the effect size will be less when aiming to make something that is already quite good better, compared to trying to improve a weak area of the curriculum.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20774" xml_f="21202" txt_i="16558" txt_f="16986">It is worth noting that the outcome measure for this study was the degree to which the teaching session met the educational needs of the audience.

As the skills learned in this educational intervention are generic it is also hoped that this intervention may also improve the educational value of other resident teaching sessions. This is important to both the residents, as they are evaluated on their teaching performance and to students as the majority of their clinical teaching is actually provided by residents. Further studies are required to compare different educational interventions and also to consider the impact of these on higher-level end-points, such as resident and student competency.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22525" xml_f="22544" txt_i="18183" txt_f="18202">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22555" xml_f="22610" txt_i="18203" txt_f="18258">The author(s) declare they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22632" xml_f="22654" txt_i="18260" txt_f="18282">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22665" xml_f="23003" txt_i="18283" txt_f="18621">MJM and KM were responsible for the conception of the study.
