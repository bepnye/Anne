In this case, inpatient and outpatient patients with complications such as urinary leakage and urinary infection and stoning stent and difficult removing of stent and severity of urinary symptoms, patients are examined based on IPSS questionnaire.

These results indicate the usefulness and alternativeness of the conventional technique with this method, which required similar studies with larger sample sizes.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Christian</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Noninvasive Removal of Ureteral Stents in Kidney Transplant Recipients</article-title><source>Surgery and Urology, Publication Number:1737</source><year>2012</year><comment>Retrieved from
