In total, 91% of sugammadex patients and 94% of neostigmine patients received sevoflurane maintenance anesthesia, with most patients receiving a range of sevoflurane concentrations over the course of anesthesia. In the sugammadex group as a whole, the sevoflurane end-tidal concentration ranged overall from 0.5-4.2% in the period before sugammadex administration and from 2.4-0.2% in the period after sugammadex administration. The corresponding concentrations in the neostigmine group overall were 0.3-4.0% before and 3.5-0.1% after neostigmine. The duration of sevoflurane exposure in the sugammadex group ranged from 14 minutes to 6.0 hours before sugammadex, and from 1 minute to 3.9 hours after sugammadex. The durations of sevoflurane exposure in the neostigmine group ranged from 45 minutes to 3.8 hours before and from 17 minutes to 5.2 hours after neostigmine. Four patients in the sugammadex group did not receive sevoflurane; three of these received isoflurane rather than sevoflurane (concentration ranging from 0.7-4.0% overall) and one patient received no maintenance anesthesia. In addition, in one sugammadex patient, sevoflurane was stopped after 14 minutes and desflurane (6-6.5%) administered instead. Two patients in the neostigmine group did not receive sevoflurane. They received isoflurane (0.3-0.9%) or desflurane (3.7-8.0%) instead. The inhalation anesthetic was maintained at least until recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 in 75% of patients in the two groups (determined in those patients in whom the time to a TOF ratio of 0.9 was known and the time of anesthetic discontinuation was recorded [n = 64]).

In accordance with the protocol, in most patients (83% in the sugammadex group and 75% in the neostigmine group), the reversal drug was administered at a PTC of 1 or 2 after the last dose of vecuronium, although 7 patients in the sugammadex group and 9 patients in the neostigmine group received reversal at a higher PTC, including one patient who received neostigmine at a PTC of 6, which was considered to be a protocol violation. The median (range) time between administration of the last dose of vecuronium and administration of the reversal agent was 19.7 (3.4 to 102.7) minutes in the sugammadex group and 15.5 (3.2 to 112.4) minutes in the neostigmine group.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="27036" xml_f="27052" txt_i="20563" txt_f="20579">Time to recovery</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27063" xml_f="27952" txt_i="20580" txt_f="21469">Four subjects in the sugammadex intent-to-treat group (including the patient who received rocuronium and neostigmine in error), and 19 in the neostigmine group had missing data for time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9.

In addition, the Central Independent Adjudication Committee considered the time to the TOF ratio of 0.9 to be unreliable in two subjects from each group because of interference, an unstable recording or because of an incorrect set-up procedure of the TOF-Watch.

However, these tests were not meant to stand alone but rather to complement the findings of the objective neuromuscular monitoring. On transfer from the recovery room, all except 2% of patients in the sugammadex group and 9% in the neostigmine group who underwent these tests had no evidence of muscle weakness and all but one patient in the neostigmine group could perform the 5-second head-lift test.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43936" xml_f="44075" txt_i="33884" txt_f="34023">Inhalational anesthetics such as sevoflurane and isoflurane can significantly prolong the duration of action of rocuronium and vecuronium [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="44107" xml_f="44109" txt_i="34023" txt_f="34025">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44116" xml_f="44117" txt_i="34025" txt_f="34026">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><offsets xml_i="44149" xml_f="44151" txt_i="34026" txt_f="34028">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44158" xml_f="44284" txt_i="34028" txt_f="34154">], and it is well known that volatile anesthetics can also prolong the time to reversal with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="44315" xml_f="44316" txt_i="34154" txt_f="34155">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44323" xml_f="44799" txt_i="34155" txt_f="34631">]. Most of the patients in the current study received maintenance anesthesia with sevoflurane, and only one patient received no inhalation anesthetics. We showed that sugammadex reversal of profound block was rapid even in the presence of sevoflurane, isoflurane or desflurane.

The most commonly reported AEs in both groups were procedural pain and nausea. More patients in the sugammadex group experienced headache, nausea, or vomiting compared with the neostigmine group, although most of these occurrences were not considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. In total, 20% of sugammadex-treated patients and 28% of neostigmine-treated patients experienced AEs that were considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug. Apart from nausea, most of these were isolated reports and of mild-to-moderate intensity. There were no serious drug-related AEs in any treatment group. Many of the tests available for the determination of mild residual paralysis or reoccurrence of block in the awake patient have shortcomings. Bearing in mind this limitation, there was no evidence of residual paralysis or reoccurrence of block found for any patient in this study.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="46598" xml_f="46609" txt_i="36232" txt_f="36243">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="46620" xml_f="46767" txt_i="36244" txt_f="36391">In conclusion, sugammadex provided effective and rapid reversal of profound neuromuscular block induced by vecuronium under sevoflurane anesthesia.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="46789" xml_f="46808" txt_i="36393" txt_f="36412">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="46819" xml_f="47189" txt_i="36413" txt_f="36783">This study was funded by Merck Research Laboratories, Summit, New Jersey, US.
