The most well-known is the disease-specific Stanford Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP). While Australian and international clinical guidelines promote the concept of self-management for OA, there is currently little evidence to support the use of the ASMP. Several meta-analyses have reported that arthritis self-management programs had minimal or no effect on reducing pain and disability. However, previous studies have had methodological shortcomings including the use of outcome measures which do not accurately reflect program goals. Additionally, limited cost-effectiveness analyses have been undertaken and the cost-utility of the program has not been explored.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4021" xml_f="4035" txt_i="839" txt_f="853">Methods/design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4046" xml_f="4274" txt_i="854" txt_f="1082">This study is a randomised controlled trial to determine the efficacy (in terms of Health-Related Quality of Life and self-management skills) and cost-utility of a 6-week group-based Stanford ASMP for people with hip or knee OA.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="4281" xml_f="4824" txt_i="1083" txt_f="1626">Six hundred participants referred to an orthopaedic surgeon or rheumatologist for hip or knee OA will be recruited from outpatient clinics at 2 public hospitals and community-based private practices within 2 private hospital settings in Victoria, Australia.

Interview tapes will be transcribed for analysis; coding of transcripts and any supplementary written notes will be performed using codes developed from the data. Data analysis will be ongoing and will run parallel to the data collection with the objective being to transcribe data from the interview before moving onto the next interview (where feasible). Thematic analysis from the transcripts will be used and results will be discussed according to themes identified from the data.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="32625" xml_f="32635" txt_i="26146" txt_f="26156">Time frame</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32646" xml_f="32935" txt_i="26157" txt_f="26446">This study has a 3 year time frame.

International clinical guidelines together with United States and Australian National Arthritis Action Plans provide clear statements that people with OA should be referred to self-management courses as part of routine clinical practice. However, good quality data from OA-specific clinical trials are not available to justify these recommendations.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33492" xml_f="34020" txt_i="26962" txt_f="27490">This project will provide high quality data to facilitate evidence-based recommendations regarding the ASMP. The study population is well-defined and likely to be representative of the target group who might be expected to benefit from the ASMP. The course leaders will be highly trained and the course quality will be tightly controlled. Finally, the outcome measures to be used in this study were selected to encompass key data for a wide range of stakeholders including consumers, clinicians, policymakers and funding bodies.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34027" xml_f="34709" txt_i="27491" txt_f="28173">If the study demonstrates that the ASMP is effective, this will support referral to the program by clinicians caring for people with OA. Endorsement of the ASMP by medical professionals could result in a relatively inexpensive modality being made more readily available to the millions of Australians suffering from OA. Furthermore, if this research finds the ASMP to be effective, it will provide governmental agencies and non-government organisations with evidence to facilitate the appropriate dissemination of this program. In contrast, if the program is not found to be effective then the resources spent in this area could be re-directed to other evidence-based interventions.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34731" xml_f="34750" txt_i="28175" txt_f="28194">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34761" xml_f="34821" txt_i="28195" txt_f="28255">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34843" xml_f="34865" txt_i="28257" txt_f="28279">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34876" xml_f="35092" txt_i="28280" txt_f="28496">RO and RB were responsible for writing the study protocol, with additional detail provided by IA.
