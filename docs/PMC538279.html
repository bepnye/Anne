Dietary energy was restricted, but was slightly higher during the VLCK (1855 kcal/day) compared to the LF (1562 kcal/day) diet for men. Both between and within group comparisons revealed a distinct advantage of a VLCK over a LF diet for weight loss, total fat loss, and trunk fat loss for men (despite significantly greater energy intake). The majority of women also responded more favorably to the VLCK diet, especially in terms of trunk fat loss. The greater reduction in trunk fat was not merely due to the greater total fat loss, because the ratio of trunk fat/total fat was also significantly reduced during the VLCK diet in men and women. Absolute REE (kcal/day) was decreased with both diets as expected, but REE expressed relative to body mass (kcal/kg), was better maintained on the VLCK diet for men only. Individual responses clearly show the majority of men and women experience greater weight and fat loss on a VLCK than a LF diet.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6774" xml_f="6784" txt_i="2323" txt_f="2333">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6795" xml_f="7196" txt_i="2334" txt_f="2735">This study shows a clear benefit of a VLCK over LF diet for short-term body weight and fat loss, especially in men.

We addressed this in several ways. First, subjects were initially randomly assigned to either a LF or VLCK weight loss diet. Weight loss, body composition (fat mass and lean body mass), trunk fat, and resting energy expenditure (REE) were assessed before and after each diet (Phase I). Because there is often a great deal of variation in response to diet, we decided that a direct comparison of responses to a VLCK and LF diet should be made in the same person. To achieve this aim, we asked subjects to switch to the opposite diet after completion of the first diet period (Phase II), after which the same measurements were assessed (i.e., each subject consumed a VLCK and LF diet).

Foods encouraged during the LF diet included whole grains (breads, cereals, and pastas), fruit/fruit juices, vegetables, vegetable oils, and low-fat dairy and meat products. We developed customized diabetic exchange lists for the VLCK diet period in order to ensure a constant energy and balance of protein (~30% energy), fat (~60% energy), and carbohydrate (~10% of energy) throughout the day.

In this case, it is often claimed that inaccurate reporting of dietary intake or errors in nutrient databases (e.g., overestimation of calories from certain cuts of meats) account for the greater weight reducing effects of VLCK diets. On the other hand, LF diets are frequently encouraged because of their high bulk and over-reporting seems as likely on a LF as a VLCK diet. In the absence of a clear reason why error in these studies should always go in one direction – LF rarely do better than VLCK – one has to take the data at face value. Also, the large difference in weight loss between men on the VLCK and LF diets in the present study suggests that at least some impact of macronutrient composition is being seen.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="31790" xml_f="31894" txt_i="23621" txt_f="23725">Metabolic advantage may occur on a VLCK diet due to the demand on protein turnover for gluconeogenesis [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35"><offsets xml_i="31926" xml_f="31928" txt_i="23725" txt_f="23727">35</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31935" xml_f="32004" txt_i="23727" txt_f="23796">], greater thermogenic effect of protein and loss of energy as heat [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36"><offsets xml_i="32036" xml_f="32038" txt_i="23796" txt_f="23798">36</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32045" xml_f="32046" txt_i="23798" txt_f="23799">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"><offsets xml_i="32078" xml_f="32080" txt_i="23799" txt_f="23801">37</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32087" xml_f="32700" txt_i="23801" txt_f="24414">], and/or excretion of energy in the form of ketones via urine, feces, and/or sweat. Although we did not see a difference in REE, the metabolic advantage on a VLCK diet may be below the sensitivity of our measurements. Further, since REE was obtained in a postabsorptive state, this does not rule out a potential benefit derived from the acute postprandial thermic effect of protein ingestion. In terms of REE, there was a slight advantage for men on the VLCK diet when expressed relative to body mass, which could benefit long-term weight maintenance but this needs to be validated in studies of longer duration.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32707" xml_f="32977" txt_i="24415" txt_f="24685">Although the issue of whether VLCK diets result in greater weight loss compared to LF diets has obvious significance, a primary purpose of this study and an equally important question relates to the composition of weight loss.

Upper body fat carries a greater health risk than fat stored in other regions of the body and thus an effective weight loss approach should consider the regional distribution of fat loss. Proportionally, trunk fat mass comprised less of the total fat mass after the VLCK but not the LF diet. The mechanisms regulating composition of weight loss and distribution of fat loss during VLCK diets remain unclear, but could be mediated in part by changes in hormones such as insulin, leptin, or cortisol that could differentially impact nutrient partitioning.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35418" xml_f="36236" txt_i="26842" txt_f="27660">In summary, this study showed greater weight loss and fat loss preferentially from the trunk region in subjects on a closely monitored free-living VLCK diet compared to a LF diet. These diets were prescribed to be energy restricted and isocaloric. The superiority of the VLCK diet over the LF diet was most dramatic for men, but when individual responses were examined, a group of women clearly showed metabolic advantage as well. Indeed, 12/13 women experienced greater fat loss in the trunk region during the VLCK diet compared to the low-fat diet. Such a response is consistent with a metabolic advantage of VLCK diets. The ultimate proof for such a theory will depend on the findings from carefully controlled feeding and metabolic studies that encompass physiological measurements to isolate plausible mechanisms.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="36292" xml_f="36314" txt_i="27662" txt_f="27684">Supplementary Material</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="36396" xml_f="36413" txt_i="27685" txt_f="27702">Additional File 1</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36424" xml_f="36594" txt_i="27703" txt_f="27873">Table 1.
