In the United Kingdom’s (UK) national clinical guidelines for stroke, self-management is suggested as one approach which can support long-term needs. In the UK NHS, self-management interventions are delivered in various ways. Regardless of the delivery mechanism, a tailored approach and ways to integrate peer support are advocated. Group delivery offers a platform for peer support and has the potential to remain individualised. However, before the efficacy of a group self-management intervention can be tested, the feasibility must be explored. This research investigates the feasibility of a GroUp Self-management intervention for sTrOke (GUSTO).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5825" xml_f="5832" txt_i="797" txt_f="804">Methods</offsets></title><p id="Par2"><offsets xml_i="5853" xml_f="6030" txt_i="805" txt_f="982">A randomised waitlist control design will be used to investigate the feasibility of a group self-management intervention adapted from an existing one-to-one intervention called </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="6038" xml_f="6045" txt_i="982" txt_f="989">Bridges</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="6054" xml_f="6461" txt_i="989" txt_f="1396">.

The setting will be a Hyper Acute Stroke Unit (HASU) in a central London Hospital. The intense nature of HASU means patients are initially consented to a Permission To Contact register (PTC) and given information about the study, allowing individuals to read the information sheet in their own time. The PTC is a list of those who have given permission to be contacted by researchers in the future. It enables access to a naturally occurring sample within the stroke population which minimises the risk of selection bias and maximises the chance the sample is representative of the target population. The PTC has been recruiting stroke survivors since 2013. As a result, it contains individuals who had their stroke up to 2 years previously, offering a greater range of time post stroke than if recruiting from the start of this research. A limitation of the PTC used for the proposed study is that it only comprises patients who can consent for themselves during their stay in HASU so may result in a sample of individuals with less severe strokes. This will be acknowledged in the final analysis and write up of findings.</offsets></p><p id="Par39"><offsets xml_i="20245" xml_f="21284" txt_i="11790" txt_f="12829">After December 2015, the PTC was adapted to become the PTC+ which does include patients that are unable to consent for themselves (a family of friend can consent on their behalf). This could minimise a possible selection bias towards participants with less severe strokes. To gain the benefits of both these registers, we will recruit from the PTC for the first 15 participants and the PTC+ for the remaining 45. Recruitment will start from the first entry on each register and continued in chronological order. A member of the research team will enrol participants in the study (including consent). Once an individual has been enrolled by a member of the research team, they will be randomly allocated to a condition by a statistician using blocked randomisation to ensure balanced numbers. The first patient was enrolled on 25/02/2016.

The study also has a multidisciplinary management panel who co-designed the methodology, including a stroke survivor. However, there are some limitations of the proposed study that should be addressed. The recruitment strategy means that participants will be recruited from one hospital which limits the geographical reach. Although it was decided that this was acceptable for the current study as the priority is to assess feasibility, a larger future trial should include more than one recruitment site to increase the generalisability of the data. In addition, as stated in MRC guidelines, it can be problematic for complex interventions to be fully standardised, especially as group self-management interventions should retain enough flexibility to adapt to context and ensure they are tailored to each individual [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11"><offsets xml_i="49339" xml_f="49341" txt_i="36817" txt_f="36819">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49348" xml_f="49583" txt_i="36819" txt_f="37054">].

It will do so by exploring the acceptability of the intervention, the occurrence of serious adverse events occur, the appropriateness of research measures and adherence rates which should be over 85%. It will also inform the design of future work assessing the efficacy of a group self-management intervention. It will do so in a number of ways. Firstly, this research will help determine the project timeline as information about the number and rate of eligible participants that can be recruited as well as the follow-up questionnaire return rate will be available. Secondly, it will determine whether future work should randomise participants to a condition as their willingness to do so will be documented. Thirdly, the design of the group self-management intervention may be adapted based on the acceptability to stroke survivors and family/friends/carers. Finally, the information to conduct a power calculation which will determine the sample size of a larger trial will be available as a result of documented dropout rates and standard deviation of outcome measures.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="50871" xml_f="50887" txt_i="38231" txt_f="38247">Additional files</offsets></title><sec id="Sec31"><p><offsets xml_i="50914" xml_f="50915" txt_i="38248" txt_f="38249">
