It is composed of 26 mg/ml HA from biofermentation origin crosslinked with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether. The CPM technology creates a product with variable crosslinking densities within the gel, where denser areas ensure a volumizing effect and less dense areas ensure cohesivity of the matrix. These properties allow the gel to be easily extruded through the needle during injection and prevent it from migrating once implanted. CPM-26 is also characterized by its plasticity, which allows the practitioner to mold and sculpt the product easily into the desired shape once injected to achieve optimal aesthetic results. VYC-20 is a 20 mg/ml HA manufactured with patented Vycross technology, which uses a proprietary mix of a majority of low-molecular weight (&lt; 1 mDa) HA and minority of high-molecular weight (≥ 1 mDa) HA to maintain a tightly crosslinked network of HA chains providing the gel with high cohesivity and viscosity.</offsets><sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8192" xml_f="8193" txt_i="4142" txt_f="4143">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8200" xml_f="8201" txt_i="4143" txt_f="4144">–</offsets><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8232" xml_f="8233" txt_i="4144" txt_f="4145">8</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="8246" xml_f="8496" txt_i="4145" txt_f="4395"> Both CPM-26 and VYC-20 are designed to be injected subcutaneously or in deeper soft-tissue layers to restore facial volumes.
