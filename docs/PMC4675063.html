On average, providers served 5.4 (±2.7) children in their home, of which 23 % were 1 year old, 19 % were 2 years old, and 24 % were 3-4 years old. About 90 % of providers reported that they felt “quite a bit” or “a lot” of responsibility for getting children to eat healthy foods and be physically active, yet their self-reported practices demonstrated that they provide meals that were high in fat and children engaged in too much sedentary time. More than half of providers served fried foods at least once a week, roughly three quarters did not regularly serve lean meats, and almost half served primarily whole milk to children two years and older.

Healthy Eating Index scores, calculated from DOCC data, were lower than recommended, with scores averaging 64.3 (range 52.8–71.5) out of 100. Accelerometer data showed that children, on average, accumulated only 20.2 min of MVPA but 215 min of sedentary time while at the FCCH. Measures of the FCCH physical activity and nutrition environment collected during in-home observations also showed great need for improvement. Scores from the EPAO were 11.3 (out of 20) for the nutrition environment, and 9.12 (out of a possible 20) for the physical activity environment. Similar to the previous pilot survey, providers had poor awareness of their own health. In their self-administered questionnaires, providers generally rated their own health as “very good” or “excellent,” but they reported poor health behaviors. Specifically, four of the five providers were overweight or obese, ate on average only 3.1 cups of fruits and vegetables per day, and obtained on average only 13.4 min of MVPA during 7.8 h of monitoring.

Integrating these three topics allowed us to address the FCCH’s social and physical environment related to children’s physical activity and nutrition, as well as a number of factors that impact the FCCH’s ability to implement and sustain these changes. Providers found all three topics to be helpful, and all were confident or very confident that they had learned new skills to help improve in each of these areas. While feedback from participants was positive, the pilot study was limited in its duration (eight weeks). The coach delivering the intervention in this pilot had only a fixed number of contacts through which to deliver the intervention, including one in-home visit, one short workshop, and three brief coaching calls.

In the second matrix, performance objectives focused on creating an FCCH environment that would foster healthy physical activity and eating habits in children. In the third matrix, performance objectives targeted the provider’s business practices in order to help reduce stress and overcome business-related barriers to change. In each matrix, program aims and corresponding performance objectives were used as row headers. Behavioral determinants, specifically knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, attitudes, and social support, and autonomy became the column headers in each matrix.

The workshop is three hours in length and designed to be primarily educational, building providers’ behavioral capacity (knowledge and skills). Workshops also include opportunities to reflect on their current behaviors, set goals and plan for change, and build social support between providers as they exchange ideas (relatedness). Educational binders and tool kit resources are disseminated during workshops and help reinforce the content delivered during workshops. The binders were professionally illustrated and produced to ensure a high-quality appearance.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42110" xml_f="42611" txt_i="30154" txt_f="30655">Tool-kits provide practical resources (e.g., pedometers, re-useable water cups, child sized divided plates, poly spots, diet and physical activity related books, etc.) to support provider efforts to create healthier environments. The community advisory group confirmed the importance of the in-person group workshop, but predicted some difficulties with attendance given providers’ busy schedules. Additionally, they generally had positive feedback on the materials they were asked to review by email.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42618" xml_f="43700" txt_i="30656" txt_f="31738">Coaching sessions are designed to last 30–45 min and employ Motivational Interviewing techniques. A general guide was developed for these coaching contacts to ensure some consistency, but the nature of Motivational Interviewing is that it is a participant-led process that allows for autonomy building by letting the participant, rather than the coach, lead the conversation and set goals. During each contact, the health behavior coach works with the provider to review current goals, assess progress toward goals, problem-solve around any barriers that might be encountered, and revise action plans as needed. Motivational interviewing strategies, such as using open ended questions and change talk are used to increase participant’s intrinsic motivation. Additionally, reflective listening, affirmations, and autonomy support are used to recognize participant strengths, progress, and personal choice and investment in moving towards their goals. Participants are provided with tracking sheets and encouraged to self-monitor on a daily or weekly basis to help them stay on track.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43707" xml_f="44487" txt_i="31739" txt_f="32519">Full program implementation of all three modules lasts eight to nine months, with approximately ten weeks being dedicated to each module. The workshop is used to launch each module and introduce providers to the content. Coaching contacts follow, spaced two or three weeks apart. The initial coaching contact is done in-person at the FCCH, and the remaining contacts are conducted by phone. All intervention components are delivered by health behavior coaches trained on content and in motivational interviewing techniques. The community advisory group recognized that the length of the program represented a long commitment for providers; however, they felt that offering credits toward continuing education would provide a good incentive and help address this potential barrier.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title><offsets xml_i="44520" xml_f="44561" txt_i="32521" txt_f="32562">Step 6: Development of an evaluation plan</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44572" xml_f="44969" txt_i="32563" txt_f="32960">To evaluate the efficacy of Keys, a cluster randomized controlled trial (children are clustered within the FCCH) with a pre-test post-test design.

For the control arm, we wanted to include a topic that would be of interest to the majority of family child care home providers but also not target or elicit a nutrition or physical activity improvement.

To assess reach, a detailed recruitment tracking database was created. For each community that is targeted for recruitment, the database records the total number of licensed FCCHs present, as well as the number screened, not interested, not eligible (along with reasons for ineligibility), consented, and measured. These data will allow assessment of what percent of eligible FCCHs were reached and to explore differences between participants and non-participants. To evaluate implementation (dose delivered, dose received, and intervention fidelity), a separate intervention tracking database was created. The database captures attempts to deliver intervention components (dates of workshops, coaching attempts), completion of each component by participant and date of completion. These data will allow evaluating of delivery of the intended intervention (dose delivered), participant completion rates (dose received), and fidelity to protocol (completion within the specified time frame). In addition, coaching contacts are recorded and reviewed to assess the use of motivational interviewing techniques and coverage of intervention topics. Lastly, evaluation surveys were created for each module (for workshops and coaching contacts) to capture an overall rating (poor to excellent), ratings for coaches’ ability to maintain engagement, be responsive to questions, offer support, and build motivation, and perceptions of burden.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48325" xml_f="49444" txt_i="36012" txt_f="37131">This paper presents the process used to develop Keys, an early childhood obesity prevention intervention and its evaluation. The Keys intervention program is unique in that it is designed for use in FCCHs, a child care environment rarely targeted for intervention. Development employed the full six-step IM process, including needs assessment, formulation of change objectives matrices, selection of theory-based methods and strategies, creation of intervention components and materials, development of an adoption and implementation plan, and development of the evaluation plan. The result is a comprehensive intervention program that builds on the best available evidence from current literature and integrates theoretical models. The IM process took 1 year to complete, not including the two pilots that were conducted before the larger study was funded. While time-consuming, the systematic approach to intervention and evaluation development ties the program more closely to behavior change theory and well-defined behavior change strategies, which in turn can increase chances of actual positive behavior change [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41"><offsets xml_i="49477" xml_f="49479" txt_i="37131" txt_f="37133">41</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49486" xml_f="49488" txt_i="37133" txt_f="37135">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63"><offsets xml_i="49521" xml_f="49523" txt_i="37135" txt_f="37137">63</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49530" xml_f="49532" txt_i="37137" txt_f="37139">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49539" xml_f="50787" txt_i="37140" txt_f="38388">One major theme that emerged throughout the IM process was that FCCH providers are a group with particularly high needs when it comes to promotion of healthy child diet, physical activity, and weight – current practices appear to be very poor and needs for technical assistance and support are great. The literature suggested that children enrolled in FCCHs may have increased risk for obesity, which may be due in part to the providers’ poor nutrition and physical activity practices and the lack of training in nutrition and physical activity. Our pilot survey also demonstrated that many providers feel a great deal of responsibility for getting children to eat healthy foods and be physically active, yet they are still providing foods that are high in fat and too much sedentary time. Furthermore, the pilot of the eight-week intervention suggested that even a half-day workshop was able to increase provider confidence and self-efficacy (based on self-report). The community advisory group recognized that there was a need for FCCH providers to come together, as they do not generally do so already. However, motivating providers to come together requires that they understand why it is important and how it is going to affect their business.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="50794" xml_f="52422" txt_i="38389" txt_f="40017">Another key theme that emerged was the importance of addressing FCCH providers’ needs around business and finances. Child care programs, particularly FCCHs, are businesses with low profit margins and provider incomes are very low. Data from the pilot survey showed that they charged just over $600 per month per child (on average), and cared for about five children at any given time. Furthermore, 68 % of providers had an annual income of less than $50,000 per year (meaning that they make below the median income for this area). During the pilot intervention, workshop evaluations highlighted providers’ interest in the business topics. Two of the five providers noted the business content as the most helpful information presented; taxes and record keeping were specific topics that they wanted future iterations of the program to address. The community advisory group also reiterated the importance of the business component noting that financial cost and administration time of any recommended changes must be recognized and minimized. It is critical for the success of the Keys program that this feedback be incorporated in a meaningful way. Hence, the final intervention has an entire module dedicated to “Healthy Business.” Additionally, financial considerations are integrated into the earlier modules where appropriate (e.g., how to save money purchasing healthy foods and what types of physical activity supports for children are tax deductible). To help ensure that the intervention addressed the specific needs of FCCH businesses, we also employed an expert consultant (Tom Copeland) with extensive FCCH experience.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="52429" xml_f="53693" txt_i="40018" txt_f="41282">While IM does provide a rigorous and useful process for intervention development, we encountered some challenges during implementation. One challenge was the lack of previous research in FCCHs, which provided limited evidence-based strategies. Some lessons were applied from interventions conducted in centers (e.g., having some in-person group workshops but being flexible with scheduling, assembling a community advisory group to provide feedback on intervention approaches); however, FCCHs are different settings with their own unique challenges and opportunities. The pilot studies helped inform the larger intervention; however, both had limited sample sizes and were drawn from convenience samples from central North Carolina. Given the challenges encountered during the needs assessment, a community advisory group provided insight and guidance. Given the diversity in membership (FCCH providers, parents, and members of community partnerships that provided technical assistance to FCCH providers), the number of providers at each meeting was generally limited to two or three. Therefore, the size and composition of the group may have limited the amount and breadth of feedback obtained from one of the most important sources—the FCCH providers themselves.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="53700" xml_f="54098" txt_i="41283" txt_f="41681">Going forward, researchers planning to use the IM process may benefit from a slight modification in the approach around selecting theory-based methods and strategies (step 3). Currently IM suggests that selection of behavior change strategies should be based on theory and includes a set of clearly identified behavior change techniques associated with each theory. However, Michie and colleagues [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64"><offsets xml_i="54131" xml_f="54133" txt_i="41681" txt_f="41683">64</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="54140" xml_f="54706" txt_i="41683" txt_f="42249">] have integrated behavior change techniques from six classification systems and created a taxonomy that offers clear terminology and operationalized definitions that may be more widely agreed upon and easy to recognize. Much of the Keys intervention development (steps 2-6) occurred in 2012, and this taxonomy was not yet available at that time. However, integrating use of this taxonomy into the IM process would allow more systematic identification of behavior change strategies employed in a study and facilitate comparison of the strategies used across studies.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title><offsets xml_i="54767" xml_f="54778" txt_i="42252" txt_f="42263">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="54789" xml_f="55484" txt_i="42264" txt_f="42959">The IM process encouraged the development of an intervention closely tied to theories of behavioral change. In Keys, the IM process of development was closely linked to these behavior change theories, and mechanisms of change were easily identified, assessed, and replicated. Additionally, the methods and strategies could be reassessed and changed where needed. Here, IM was a feasible tool for intervention development to create an evidence-based and theory-driven intervention applied to a novel setting. Subsequent steps will include the rigorous evaluation of the impact of the Keys intervention and dissemination of intervention results to help inform future interventions targeting FCCHs.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>(FCCH)</term><def><p>Family child care home</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>(IM)</term><def><p>Intervention mapping</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>(MVPA)</term><def><p>Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>(EPAO)</term><def><p>Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>(DOCC)</term><def><p>Diet Observation in Child Care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>(NAP SACC)</term><def><p>Nutrition and Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care </p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors’ contributions</bold></p><p>CMM coordinated the intervention and drafted the manuscript.
