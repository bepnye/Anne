However, there is a lack of research into road traffic accidents as compared to other causes of ill-health. In particular, minor injuries resulting from traffic accidents are not well-studied even though some people with such injuries might be unwell for a long period of time. Support programs that provide people who have had minor traffic-related injuries with psychological help, physical training, and other types of interventions might help people to recover more quickly. However, there is little evidence that would help to answer this question. In the trial reported here, the researchers aimed to find out whether a support program would increase the chance of recovery in people who had experienced minor traffic-related injuries and who were thought to be less likely to recover. Trial participants were randomized to receive either standard medical care or to receive standard care and also to attend a series of workshops where surgeons, psychiatrists, pain specialists, and other staff gave advice about healing, pain management, exercises, and other aspects of self-care. The primary outcome of the trial was whether participants considered themselves to have recovered, 12 mo after the injury.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7355" xml_f="7356" txt_i="3005" txt_f="3006">

Most participants assigned to the support arm did attend all of the workshop sessions. Patients assigned to attend the support workshops were more likely to report that they had recovered as compared to patients receiving standard care only, and this difference seemed quite substantial. However, there were no statistically significant differences between these two groups in the trial's secondary outcome measures. These secondary measures included scores on rating scales which attempt to measure physical and mental distress and coping ability and the amount of sick leave taken.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8147" xml_f="8148" txt_i="3778" txt_f="3779">

Additionally, a large proportion of the participants randomized to attend support sessions did actually attend the sessions, and follow-up for the primary outcome measure was virtually complete. Limitations of this study include low follow-up of patients for the secondary outcome measures in the trial. This meant that there was low power to detect clinically relevant changes in these outcome measures. Finally, although many patients were eligible for the trial, only a small proportion could be successfully contacted after being discharged from hospital, and it is possible that those people who did agree to participate were more motivated to recover than patients in general who have these injuries.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9044" xml_f="9045" txt_i="4656" txt_f="4657">

Our intervention, focused on helping the patient appreciate the healthy parts of their injured body and mind and stressing the importance of physical activities already during the early phase of the rehabilitation, should be possible to replicate by others. As our intervention was comparatively simple and moderately demanding, both in terms of health care resources needed and time expenditure on the part of the patients, it tentatively appears to be practicable and economically justifiable in routine care. At least the results are encouraging enough to warrant further studies.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title><offsets xml_i="33332" xml_f="33348" txt_i="24154" txt_f="24170">Overall Evidence</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33359" xml_f="33416" txt_i="24171" txt_f="24228">Despite the common occurrence of minor traffic injuries [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020014-b030" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="33462" xml_f="33464" txt_i="24228" txt_f="24230">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33471" xml_f="33705" txt_i="24230" txt_f="24464">], few studies have addressed the effects of auxiliary supportive measures in consecutive patients with a broad spectrum of traffic-related injuries.

This study found a worse than average outcome among patients who received the active intervention, compared to those in the control group. Two principal explanations have been proposed for this unexpected result: first, as the treatment was applied to all patients, including those with an already good prognosis, it is conceivable that unnecessary treatment might have augmented a feeling of not being well in a non-negligible proportion. Second, others have pointed out that debriefing was developed for planned stressful events.

Careful measurements of costs, from the perspective of the individual, health care, and society would also be a valuable addition. Further development of the clinical prediction rule, the PPS, still admittedly crude, is also warranted. It is conceivable that a better classification of patients in terms of prognosis will improve the selection of suitable cases and thus enhance the efficiency of the intervention. Finally, additional fine-tuning of the contents in the multidisciplinary intervention, with randomised evaluations of the single components, might improve its performance even more.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title><offsets xml_i="37628" xml_f="37650" txt_i="27925" txt_f="27947">SUPPORTING INFORMATION</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020014-sd001"><label><offsets xml_i="37739" xml_f="37756" txt_i="27948" txt_f="27965">CONSORT Checklist</offsets></label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020014.sd001.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="37819" xml_f="37855" txt_i="27965" txt_f="28001">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media><p><offsets xml_i="37880" xml_f="37891" txt_i="28002" txt_f="28013">(50 KB DOC)</offsets></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020014-sd002"><label><offsets xml_i="38001" xml_f="38015" txt_i="28014" txt_f="28028">Trial Protocol</offsets></label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020014.sd002.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="38078" xml_f="38114" txt_i="28028" txt_f="28064">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media><p><offsets xml_i="38139" xml_f="38150" txt_i="28065" txt_f="28076">(42 KB DOC)</offsets></p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Tina Levander, RN, for participating in the planning of the study, in designing the study protocol, in enrollment of patients, in data collection at inclusion and at follow-up, and for being the first contact person for the included patients; Martin Nordlander for participating in the intervention and for being the physiotherapist in the study; Kjell Flodgren for participating in planning the study and in the intervention and for being the psychologist in the study; Ove Landström, MD, for participating in the study design and in the intervention and for being the anaesthesiologist (pain expert) in the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="n103" fn-type="COI-statement"><p>
