necessary) is best done before hospital admission in outpatient clinics where rapid
screening is unnecessary. Rapid screening is more appropriate for emergency
admissions. In order to achieve better patient management, safety, and resource
utilization, many hospitals, including our own, have introduced admission wards.
Emergency patients are admitted to these wards for review, investigation, and
stabilization before being transferred to general wards or discharged to outpatient
care.</offsets><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="10015" xml_f="10017" txt_i="5024" txt_f="5026">14</offsets></sup></xref><offsets xml_i="10030" xml_f="10613" txt_i="5026" txt_f="5609"> Stay on these wards is usually around 24–36 h.
MRSA screening of emergency hospital admissions is therefore ideally done on the
admission wards. Since POCS can produce results within 1 h, whereas CS takes two or
three days, POCS will identify the MRSA status of patients before transfer or
discharge and theoretically reduce transmission and acquisition within the general
wards. Furthermore, since the postulated advantage of POCS is to reduce the 24–36 h
delay of culture screening, POCS should theoretically reduce MRSA
transmission/acquisition on the admission wards themselves.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10620" xml_f="11629" txt_i="5610" txt_f="6619">The impact of admission ward screening on MRSA acquisition on
general wards is dependent on numerous uncontrolled factors (including MRSA carriage
by elective admissions and general ward transfers) and is difficult or impossible to
measure with any accuracy. By contrast, the impact of rapid admission ward screening
on MRSA acquisition within the admission wards themselves can be measured fairly
accurately by screening at admission and on transfer/discharge and controlling for
other variables by using a cross-over trial design. If POCS does have an impact on
MRSA transmission compared with CS, then this should occur during the 22–36 h stay on
the admission wards; if it has no effect during this period then it will have no
advantage over culture- or laboratory-based PCR screening. We therefore performed a
controlled cluster-randomized cross-over clinical trial of POCS compared with CS on
the four admission wards in our hospital, with MRSA acquisition on the admission
wards as the primary outcome.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title><offsets xml_i="11661" xml_f="11668" txt_i="6621" txt_f="6628">Methods</offsets></title><sec id="sec2.1"><title><offsets xml_i="11700" xml_f="11707" txt_i="6629" txt_f="6636">Setting</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11718" xml_f="12351" txt_i="6637" txt_f="7270">The study was performed in a 900-bed, acute National Health

we conducted a multi-level Poisson segmented regression allowing for ward-level
random variation for baseline levels and time trends (from study start to end).
Step changes and changes in trends of MRSA acquisition rates per 100 patients at
risk were assessed in a model with a log link function adjusted by potential
confounders (treated as continuous variables). An offset term was included in the
natural logarithm scale to account for the monthly exposure in each ward [i.e. the
total number of patients at risk of acquiring MRSA (MRSA negative on admission)
who were discharged monthly]. The dependent variable was the monthly number of
patients negative on admission who acquired MRSA during the ward stay. The
significance of fixed effects was assessed through Wald tests. Measures of
association for the fixed terms were summarized by adjusted incidence rate ratios
per 100 patients at risk. The maximal random effect structure justified by the
data was determined by comparing models accommodating increasingly complex random
structures through log likelihood ratio tests. The analysis was conducted in
R-3.1.1. statistical software using the package ‘glmmADMB’ to fit multi-level
models by Laplace approximation.</offsets><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18469" xml_f="18471" txt_i="12812" txt_f="12814">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18478" xml_f="18480" txt_i="12814" txt_f="12816">, </offsets><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18514" xml_f="18516" txt_i="12816" txt_f="12818">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18523" xml_f="18525" txt_i="12818" txt_f="12820">, </offsets><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18559" xml_f="18561" txt_i="12820" txt_f="12822">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18568" xml_f="18723" txt_i="12822" txt_f="12977"> For robustness, model

for the initial admission and assessment of emergency patients, where they stay for
around 1–3.5 days (mean: 2 days) before being discharged home or transferred to
general wards. Admission MRSA screening of emergency patients is therefore ideally
done on admission to the admission wards. Because conventional CS takes two or three
days, some CS results become available only after patients have left the admission
ward. Rapid POCS can produce results within about 1 h and is faster even than
laboratory-based PCR testing, which produces results in about 22 h. POCS on admission
wards therefore should theoretically facilitate the efficient management of MRSA
carriers, allowing them to be placed on the MRSA pathway hours or days earlier than
with other screening methods. This would be expected to reduce MRSA transmission and
acquisition both on the admission wards themselves and then on the general wards. If
POCS does not have an impact on transmission and acquisition while on the admission
ward, it would have no advantage over CS wherever it is used.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23193" xml_f="23885" txt_i="17038" txt_f="17730">In order to test this hypothesis we performed a controlled clinical
trial to measure the impact of POCS compared with CS on MRSA acquisition within the
admission wards. We did this, first, because it is impossible to control for the
numerous other factors that affect MRSA acquisition on general wards, and second, if
POCS does have a beneficial effect, it should be detectable within the first 24–48 h.
If it does not, then slower and cheaper screening methods would be appropriate.
Furthermore, the risk of MRSA acquisition on the admission wards is significant; in
the present study there were about 20,000 patient-hours of exposure to potential MRSA
acquisition in each of the study arms.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23892" xml_f="24142" txt_i="17731" txt_f="17981">We used a cluster-randomized cross-over study to compare CS and POCS

total stay whereas in the intervention arm positive patients were isolated for 59% of
their total stay. The reason the positive patients in the intervention arm were not
isolated for closer to 100% of their stay was that the POCS test had poor sensitivity
(68.8%) when CS was used as the standard. This meant that around 30% of the
CS-positive patients were not detected by POCS and were therefore not isolated until
the CS result was returned.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25859" xml_f="26637" txt_i="19440" txt_f="20218">Despite there being no significant difference between the control

variations in background MRSA importation pressure, staffing levels, and compliance
with hand hygiene, there was no significant change in the MRSA acquisition rate
following the intervention. Thus, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that
rapid POCS of patients on admission wards reduces rates of MRSA acquisition, and
hence transmission on those wards compared with conventional, laboratory-based CS.
POCS reduced the time during which MRSA-positive patients were not isolated compared
with CS, but this did not reduce MRSA acquisition.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26644" xml_f="27255" txt_i="20219" txt_f="20830">A cluster-randomized cross-over study was an appropriate design for
this trial but it may have been under-powered. The MRSA importation pressure and the
transmission and acquisition rates in the control arm were lower than expected and,
although MRSA screening on the admission units best reflects present hospital
practice, it limited the number of clusters for analysis. Although there were four
clusters per arm (the required minimum), a larger number would have been desirable;
with each ward as its own control it was not possible to ensure with four clusters

eligible patients had full admission and discharge screen data and, although there
were about 5000 patients with full data sets in each arm, it is possible that we were
unable to detect a small effect because rates of both MRSA carriage and transmission
were low. The average length of stay on the admission wards was about two days and it
could be argued that we may not have detected MRSA transmission by culture during
this period; on the other hand, this is the time during which POCS would be expected
to have a greater impact than CS. POCS significantly reduced the number of days on
which MRSA positive patients were not isolated compared with CS, but this effect was
reduced by the fact that the sensitivity and PPV of POCS on nasal swabs compared with
CS on pooled multiple site swabs was low. These low values were partly the result of
the low prevalence of MRSA carriage, but may also have been because (in culture
studies) nasal swabs detect only around 80% of carriers compared with swabbing at
