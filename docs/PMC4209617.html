They were asked to refrain from all other oral hygiene measures during the course of the study. Oral care instructions were specified, which included the topics on importance of oral health, etiology and pathogenesis of oral diseases, methods of oral hygiene maintenance, etc., No intervention was provided to the children in the control groups and routine oral hygiene maintenance procedures were continued. The dentifrices and toothbrushes were provided to all the children who participated in the study, at regular intervals.

No statistically significant difference was observed between the rural control and urban control groups with respect to mean plaque and gingival index score reduction at 1 and 3 months examination. However, reduction in both the parameters was observed to be significantly higher in the rural study group as compared to the urban study group. Moreover, reduction in mean plaque score was seen to be higher in girls in both the control groups at 3 months examination and reverse interpretation was true for gingival index score representing higher reduction in boys in both the control groups and in the urban study group [Tables </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T3"><offsets xml_i="16924" xml_f="16925" txt_i="10191" txt_f="10192">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16932" xml_f="16937" txt_i="10192" txt_f="10197"> and </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"><offsets xml_i="16969" xml_f="16970" txt_i="10197" txt_f="10198">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16977" xml_f="16986" txt_i="10198" txt_f="10207">, Graphs </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"><offsets xml_i="17016" xml_f="17017" txt_i="10207" txt_f="10208">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17024" xml_f="17029" txt_i="10208" txt_f="10213"> and </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"><offsets xml_i="17059" xml_f="17060" txt_i="10213" txt_f="10214">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17067" xml_f="17069" txt_i="10214" txt_f="10216">].</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title><offsets xml_i="17125" xml_f="17135" txt_i="10218" txt_f="10228">DISCUSSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17146" xml_f="17824" txt_i="10229" txt_f="10907">Oral health habits, attitudes, and behavior are best established during childhood. It is believed that visualization, active participation, skill training, and reinforcement are of paramount importance in establishing and altering behavior in a child. Also, the largest and the most significant group accessible for oral health education is always seen in school systems. For that reason, in the present study, classroom was considered an ideal setting to conduct supervised toothbrushing program, especially in rural areas where oral health facilities are meager and rarely parents are concerned of their children's toothbrushing behavior.

Thane is the largest district in Maharashtra, comprising mainly tribal population, who are away from modern life of civilization, even though it is just 70 km away from Mumbai. The tribal population of Thane including Arnala is deprived of modern amenities. The children are motivated by dedicated social workers to attend school, as most of the students do not attend school regularly. As far as oral hygiene habits are concerned, it was surprising to know that the children were not brushing their teeth regularly and even some of the parents including their children were using neem, babool, or kikar twig. Few of them were also using charcoal, burnt cow dung cake powder, etc., Parents too in the study area were found to be with neglected attitude and practice regarding oral hygiene. Therefore, parents were sensitized by giving oral hygiene instructions and demonstration on brushing technique, and were instructed to supervise child's toothbrushing at home. The rural school population of Arnala was specially targeted for this. To have proper control over the brushing regime, supervised brushing was initiated. Even though in Mumbai it could have been without parentsâ supervision, the children studying in municipal school are from weaker sections and most of them live in slums, hence supervised toothbrushing was initiated.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19401" xml_f="20078" txt_i="12432" txt_f="13109">The selected age group was from 12 to 15 years, since 12 years (as per WHO recommendations) is regarded as an age for international comparison and global monitoring of disease trends including dental caries, while 15 years is considered the last age from which a reliable sample may be easily obtained through the school system in most countries.
