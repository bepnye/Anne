As this sharp decline was only observed during the PTM period, the UKPDS-OM did not have information sufficient for stimulating it.

For example, the model significantly overpredicted the probability of MI at 10 years in the subgroup of the PTM cohort composed mostly by individuals with a previous history of other IHD (&gt;50%). This could be explained by having insufficient statistical power to accurately estimate the interactions between the different complications when estimating the risk equations.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24296" xml_f="25144" txt_i="16672" txt_f="17520">Validation of computer simulation models of chronic diseases is important, as they are used increasingly by decision makers and clinicians to assess outcomes and costs of interventions in cost-effectiveness analysis, to estimate the future burden of disease, and to produce prognostic life tables with information on potential benefits from better management of risk factors. Temporal validation builds confidence that the model is able to predict risk using data that were not used in the construction of the model. The results reported add further evidence to previous external validations of UKPDS-OM equations in predicting risk of major complications. For example, model predictions have been shown to closely match the 4-year total event probability of acute coronary events reported by the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="25175" xml_f="25176" txt_i="17520" txt_f="17521">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25183" xml_f="25405" txt_i="17521" txt_f="17743">). Similarly, when simulating the PROactive study results, the UKPDS-OM estimated a 3-year relative risk of 0.87 for a composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal MI, and stroke—well within the observed 95% CI (0.72–0.98) (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="25437" xml_f="25439" txt_i="17743" txt_f="17745">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25446" xml_f="25693" txt_i="17745" txt_f="17992">).

Also, although the PTM study provided &gt;26,000 person-years of observational data for nonfatal events, it is possible that some events may not have been captured by the study questionnaires (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="26277" xml_f="26278" txt_i="18497" txt_f="18498">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26285" xml_f="27077" txt_i="18498" txt_f="19290">). Fatal events were directly reported by the Office of National Statistics and were, therefore, less likely to be missed except for patients no longer living in the U.K. Also, since risk factor data were not available for the full follow-up period, we cannot reliably determine whether event differences were the result of the event prediction equations or differences between predicted and actual risk factor time paths. Our results also suggest that additional risk factor information specific to the population being simulated is likely to improve prediction.

Hence, calibration plots per deciles of predicted risk and discrimination statistics at a single point in time as reported in this paper provide interesting but limited insights into the UKPDS-OM performance. As the aim was to evaluate the performance of the UKPDS-OM for the whole PTM cohort across 10 years of simulation and account for the uncertainty around the observed data, preference was given to measures such as model bias (mean absolute error) and MAPE, which are commonly used to assess forecasting accuracy.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28292" xml_f="28664" txt_i="20249" txt_f="20621">The UKPDS-OM has been shown to have good predictive accuracy beyond the data used to estimate it.
