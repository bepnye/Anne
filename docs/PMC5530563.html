An internal literature review investigating patients who have received up to three lines of previous therapy of any type and who responded to their most recent therapy with at least a PR suggested that 3 years is a reasonable estimate for median PFS in the control population (i.e., no consolidation), which translates to approximately 2 years from the time the participants are randomised (because it will be 3–24 months after previous therapy). An important clinical improvement would be an increase in median PFS from 2 to 3.3 years, a relatively large improvement, because consolidation is given at a time when patients would otherwise be in remission and treatment-free. The trial is powered to test the null hypothesis of no difference in PFS between the treatment arms, with a two-sided 5% level of significance and 80% power. Assuming 3 years of recruitment, 3 years of follow-up and allowing for a 5% drop-out rate, 188 participants are required (94 per arm) in order to observe 120 progression/death events.

We believe this was due partly to improved first- and second-line treatments providing a more durable remission, resulting in fewer MRD-positive patients at 3–24 months post-treatment. With more recent targeted therapies, treatment now continues for much longer than the standard 6-month period (with FCR, for example). This is likely to have reduced the number of eligible patients.</offsets></p><p id="Par99"><offsets xml_i="47001" xml_f="47684" txt_i="34827" txt_f="35510">Whilst acceptance of the trial by patients has been high, the prospect of returning to hospital for further treatment is seen as an additional burden for many, particularly those who would be required to travel a long way to their nearest hospital. Because the trial protocol represents an additional cost for the NHS Trust compared with standard treatment, it has been difficult to enrol centres into the study, despite wide support from investigators. The aim of the findings of the GALACTIC trial is to compare consolidation with obinutuzumab with no consolidation with respect to PFS in patients who have responded to previous therapy with a CR or good PR with low levels of MRD.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title><offsets xml_i="47717" xml_f="47729" txt_i="35512" txt_f="35524">Trial status</offsets></title><p id="Par100"><offsets xml_i="47752" xml_f="47900" txt_i="35525" txt_f="35673">The trial opened to recruitment in February 2015 using protocol version 2.0 (registered 30 October 2014) and closed to recruitment in February 2017.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="47956" xml_f="47972" txt_i="35675" txt_f="35691">Additional files</offsets></title><sec id="Sec30"><p><offsets xml_i="47999" xml_f="48000" txt_i="35692" txt_f="35693">
