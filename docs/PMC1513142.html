Children with autism often have sleep difficulties, and it was thought that aromatherapy massage might enable more rapid sleep onset, less sleep disruption and longer sleep duration. Twelve children with autism and learning difficulties (2 girls and 10 boys aged between 12 years 2 months to 15 years 7 months) in a residential school participated in a within subjects repeated measures design: 3 nights when the children were given aromatherapy massage with lavender oil were compared with 14 nights when it was not given. The children were checked every 30 min throughout the night to determine the time taken for the children to settle to sleep, the number of awakenings and the sleep duration. One boy's data were not analyzed owing to lengthy absence. Repeated measures analysis revealed no differences in any of the sleep measures between the nights when the children were given aromatherapy massage and nights when the children were not given aromatherapy massage. The results suggest that the use of aromatherapy massage with lavender oil has no beneficial effect on the sleep patterns of children with autism attending a residential school. It is possible that there are greater effects in the home environment or with longer-term interventions.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aromatherapy</kwd><kwd>massage</kwd><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>children</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4123" xml_f="4161" txt_i="1419" txt_f="1457">What is the Evidence for Aromatherapy?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4172" xml_f="4351" txt_i="1458" txt_f="1637">A recent review of the evidence for sensory stimulation in dementia care suggests that aromatherapy with lemon balm or lavender oil decreases agitation in patients with dementia (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1"><offsets xml_i="4382" xml_f="4383" txt_i="1637" txt_f="1638">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4390" xml_f="4531" txt_i="1638" txt_f="1779">).

Some of these difficulties may be owing to over arousal or agitation. Given the effects of aromatherapy massage in dementia and the wider claims of the effects of aromatherapy on sleep and arousal, we sought to examine whether aromatherapy massage enabled an improved sleep pattern in children with autism. During waking hours the behavior of children with autism is characterized by repetitive activities such as stereotyped behavior, which are thought to be the result of non-optimal levels (over and under arousal) of arousal (</offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><offsets xml_i="6661" xml_f="6667" txt_i="3422" txt_f="3428">Fig. 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6674" xml_f="7027" txt_i="3428" txt_f="3781">). The putative mode of action of aromatherapy would be that it enabled an arousal level closer to the optimal, and hence, made sleep both easier to achieve and to maintain.

The school checks diagnoses of autism against DSM-IV criteria before the children are admitted. One boy had a diagnosis of Down's syndrome in addition to the diagnosis of autism. One girl was on carbamazepine and topiramate for control of her epilepsy and one of the boys was taking risperidone for control of behavior.

This corresponds to an ABABAB design in which the A refers to nights when no aromatherapy was provided, and B refers to those nights when aromatherapy was provided.

All the children were free to leave the aromatherapy sessions, although none did so. In order to accustom the children to aromatherapy massage, it had been used as a leisure activity at various times during the school day in the previous term. This ceased once the trial started.

Any treatment that involves bodily contact cannot easily be subject to a double blind trial because the recipient will inevitably be aware that they are being touched. The materials used also leave traces on the skin of the recipient, and the aromatic constituent is easily detected. In order to ensure adequate blinding of the assessors, video or automated data gathering methods (e.g. actimeters, which are small devices the size of a wrist watch) would be useful. Alternatively, researchers might wish to consider the possibility of separating the aromatherapy and massage constituents of this intervention, since lavender oil mist has already been shown to have beneficial effects on agitation in the elderly (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8"><offsets xml_i="17783" xml_f="17784" txt_i="13582" txt_f="13583">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17791" xml_f="17914" txt_i="13583" txt_f="13706">) and there is some research showing better immune responses when aromatic essential oils are added to massage procedures (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9"><offsets xml_i="17945" xml_f="17946" txt_i="13706" txt_f="13707">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17953" xml_f="17969" txt_i="13707" txt_f="13723">).

Some consideration should also be given to the possibility that this population might choose to have aromatherapy massage because it is a pleasant sensation regardless of its effects on sleep, behavior or learning. Further trials should therefore consider the implications for the quality of life of the participants, by measuring behavioral disturbances, learning or quality of life in this population.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18581" xml_f="18922" txt_i="14312" txt_f="14653">Finally, consideration should be given to the optimum duration of the intervention. The use of an ABABAB design requires both that aromatherapy has a rapid mode of action and that it does not continue to have effects for more than a few hours after it was administered. Support for this assertion comes from studies on sleep in the elderly (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14"><offsets xml_i="18954" xml_f="18956" txt_i="14653" txt_f="14655">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18963" xml_f="19010" txt_i="14655" txt_f="14702">) and joint attention in children with autism (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15"><offsets xml_i="19042" xml_f="19044" txt_i="14702" txt_f="14704">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19051" xml_f="19152" txt_i="14704" txt_f="14805">).
