In addition, because efficacy was evaluated in the eye with higher baseline IOP for all patients (ie, the ‘worse' eye), the absolute magnitudes of IOP reduction observed in the BBFC+PGA and vehicle+PGA groups may be greater than would be observed in a clinical setting (ie, for a patient's ‘</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29729" xml_f="30403" txt_i="22461" txt_f="23135">In conclusion, adding BBFC to PGA therapy produced a mean diurnal IOP reduction of 5.7 mm Hg (25%) compared with PGA-treated baseline and was superior to vehicle+PGA. BBFC+PGA therapy was well-tolerated, and no safety concerns were observed beyond the known safety profiles of the individual agents. PGAs are often preferred as initial monotherapy because of their IOP-lowering efficacy, lower frequency of instillation, and acceptable tolerability profiles.
