They facilitate better maintenance of weight loss than other interventions. These therapies can be used either in a group approach as well as in individual treatment.

This is demanding for both the patient as well as the health care system and makes this mode of delivery not well suited for the large section of the population that needs to be reached.

The ALIFE@Work trial is designed to study these outcomes. This trial is carried out in a working population.

Health conditions related to overweight, physical inactivity and unhealthy eating habits are assessed using a series of questions about the use of medication for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, angina, heart disease, myocardial infarct, depression and diabetes. Weight outcome evaluation is assessed by three questions concerning acceptable weight, desirable weight in six months and the wish for weight loss or weight management. Weight control behaviours are measured by reports of frequency of self weighing, frequency of weight loss attempts in the last two years, and employed methods for weight control.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="36404" xml_f="36422" txt_i="29252" txt_f="29270">Process evaluation</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36433" xml_f="36985" txt_i="29271" txt_f="29823">The process evaluation among participants assesses the participants opinion of the allocated study group, use and appraisal of the components of the lifestyle intervention programme or (in the case of the control group) of the provided general brochures, evaluation of coaching by the personal counsellor (if applicable) and a generic grade for the programme.
