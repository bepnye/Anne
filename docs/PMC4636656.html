Employees were recruited from four mental health services prior to randomising three services to the intervention and one to no-intervention control. Intervention managers received a facilitated e-learning programme on work-related stress. Main outcomes were Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), 12-item GHQ and sickness absence &lt;21 days from human resources. 35 in-depth interviews were undertaken with key informants, managers and employees, and additional observational data collected.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6277" xml_f="6284" txt_i="821" txt_f="828">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6295" xml_f="7105" txt_i="829" txt_f="1639">424 of 649 (65%) employees approached consented, of whom 350 provided WEMWBS at baseline and 284 at follow-up; 41 managers out of 49 were recruited from the three intervention clusters and 21 adhered to the intervention. WEMWBS scores fell from 50.4–49.0 in the control (n=59) and 51.0–49.9 in the intervention (n=225), giving an intervention effect of 0.5 (95% CI −3.2 to 4.2). 120/225 intervention employees had a manager who was adherent to the intervention. HR data on sickness absence (n=393) showed no evidence of effect. There were no effects on GHQ score or work characteristics. Online quiz knowledge scores increased across the study in adherent managers. Qualitative data provided a rich picture of the context within which the intervention took place and managers’ and employees’ experiences of it.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7127" xml_f="7138" txt_i="1641" txt_f="1652">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7149" xml_f="7553" txt_i="1653" txt_f="2057">A small benefit from the intervention on well-being was explained by the mixed methods approach, implicating a low intervention uptake by managers and suggesting that education alone may be insufficient.

In-depth interviews were carried out between February and April 2014 with a sample of managers. A purposive approach was adopted to ensure a heterogeneous sample, including men and women from the intervention and control group clusters. Twenty-one of the 41 managers in the intervention clusters who had consented to participate in the study were approached for interview and 11 agreed; a response rate of 52% among intervention group managers. Eight managers from the control cluster were invited to interview and two agreed. Thus a total of 13 in-depth interviews were undertaken with managers, 10 women and 3 men (reflecting the female/male ratio in the managers participating in the trial). The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Interviewed managers were also invited to a ‘feedback’ meeting at the end of the data collection; this meeting was convened as a focus group discussion, and was audio recorded and transcribed. Three managers attended.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20624" xml_f="21435" txt_i="12929" txt_f="13740">A similar purposive approach to sampling was adopted for selecting employees for interview. To avoid possible influence on employees’ questionnaire responses, we approached employees for interview after they had completed their follow-up questionnaires. Thirty-six employees from across the four clusters in the study were invited for interview (from the sample of 163 employees who had completed their follow-up questionnaires by this time). Ten employees responded (a relatively low response rate of 28%), but we were unable to arrange interviews with two of these employees and subsequently undertook a total of eight employee interviews (six women, two men, again reflecting the male female ratio in the trial employee sample). The sample comprised two employees from each of the four clusters in the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21442" xml_f="21853" txt_i="13741" txt_f="14152">We adopted a narrative approach to interviewing, meaning that interview questions encouraged respondents to recount stories of specific, anonymised cases and incidents, as a way of eliciting a rich and reflective account of the complexities of managing stress at work.

Effectiveness comparing intervention and control clusters was estimated using a random effects model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation. As the random effects model assumes a large sample for the number of clusters, the CIs were calculated using the SE from the model and the t-distribution with 2 df instead of the Normal distribution. Post hoc analyses were carried out to assess changes in well-being scores for employees of managers who did or did not engage with the intervention, as well as for employees of managers who changed position during the course of the study.

The e-learning programme was considered easy to access, straightforward to use and the content relevant. Managers were ambivalent about e-learning, identifying both benefits and disadvantages of its flexibility. They favoured a ‘blended’ approach, seeing e-learning as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, other learning methods and welcomed the opportunity to share experiences and for peer learning in the face-to-face group meetings. The key identified value of the e-learning programme was that it ‘backed up’ existing knowledge and encouraged reflection on managerial practice rather than imparted new knowledge. When asked about the skills that managers need to deal with stress and in recounting specific instances of workplace stress, managers and employees focused on the value of experiential knowledge, on the need to ‘juggle’ competing demands and roles and on affective qualities such as trust, empathy, compassion and approachability (‘emotional intelligence and sensitivity’) rather than the management competencies explicitly covered in the e-learning modules (see </offsets><xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1"><offsets xml_i="52557" xml_f="52562" txt_i="32619" txt_f="32624">box 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="52569" xml_f="52572" txt_i="32624" txt_f="32627">).

Therapy's quite individualised and quite thought provoking, and you're sharing your soul to the devil, so to speak, aren't you? That's how it feels.

I think I've had to draw on knowing the policy, knowing what I can and cannot allow her to do. The return to work policy, the phased return, all of that, I've had to look on that.

There were some limitations of the study that worked against the trial showing an effect. The setting for the trial—an NHS Trust went through a major reorganisation during the course of the study. This may have impacted on the acceptance of the study by employees and managers and potentially put off managers from fully engaging with the intervention. This also meant that some managers were reallocated during the study, interfering with recruitment and retention of managers. A limitation of the qualitative sample was that it only included one ‘non-adherent’ manager. Furthermore, as consent had not been gained for this purpose, we were unable to approach managers in the Trust who did not participate in the study, although their views would have been of interest.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="60165" xml_f="61264" txt_i="39789" txt_f="40888">Although we had initial meetings with senior managers to embed the study in the local work culture we could have had more buy-in from senior managers to enable them to permit their middle managers to spend more time on the intervention. We had a poorer than expected intervention uptake rate among managers which may partly relate to the work pressures cited above but may also be that we failed to attract the less committed managers who might have benefited more from the intervention. The interval between intervention and follow-up employee well-being measurement may have been too short thus not allowing sufficient time for the managers to implement changes in management style they learnt from the intervention. It is also possible that we were limited by shortcomings in the intervention itself and the underpinning theory of change. The e-learning programme may require some more active elements that encourage behaviour change in managers. On the other hand, the subgroup analysis suggested that the intervention appeared to work among employees whose managers adhered to the intervention.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title><offsets xml_i="61295" xml_f="61333" txt_i="40890" txt_f="40928">Implications for practice and research</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="61344" xml_f="61646" txt_i="40929" txt_f="41231">The incorporation of qualitative investigation in this project with quantitative analysis has allowed us to explore the recipients’ response to the intervention, explore the reasons for the trial findings and question the appropriateness of the underlying theory (see Russell J, Berney L, Stansfeld S, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="61654" xml_f="61660" txt_i="41231" txt_f="41237">et al.</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="61669" xml_f="62755" txt_i="41237" txt_f="42323"> The role of qualitative research in adding value to a randomised control trial: lessons from a pilot study of a guided e-learning intervention for managers to improve employee well-being and reduce sickness absence.

It is too early for clear implications for practice but in further research we would place a greater emphasis on affective engagement and experiential learning for managers. Thus we propose that this type of education alone is insufficient to change managers’ behaviour and that we need a more active approach. In fact the managers did not fully engage with all the learning activities in the e-learning programme and did not all attend the two face-to-face meetings—and these were not included as criteria for adherence. There is scope to include elements that affectively engage the manager with the programme, encourage manager reflection and behaviour change.
