The same weight-related dose of NAC is used irrespective of paracetamol dose. Complications include frequent nausea and vomiting, anaphylactoid reactions and dosing errors.

In addition as anaphylactoid response appears related to plasma concentrations of both NAC and paracetamol anaphylactoid reactions should be less likely. This study is not powered to assess the relative efficacy of the two NAC regimens, however it will give useful information to power future studies. As the first formal randomised clinical trial in this patient group in over 30 years this study will also provide information to support further studies in patients in paracetamol overdose, particularly, when linked with modern novel biomarkers of liver damage, patients at different toxicity risk.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7446" xml_f="7464" txt_i="2366" txt_f="2384">Trial registration</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7475" xml_f="7535" txt_i="2385" txt_f="2445">EudraCT number 2009-017800-10, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier</offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01050270?term=SNAP&amp;rank=4"><offsets xml_i="7646" xml_f="7657" txt_i="2445" txt_f="2456">NCT01050270</offsets></ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Paracetamol</kwd><kwd>Acetylcysteine</kwd><kwd>Overdose</kwd><kwd>Antidotes</kwd><kwd>Hepatotoxicity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7864" xml_f="7874" txt_i="2465" txt_f="2475">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7885" xml_f="8096" txt_i="2476" txt_f="2687">Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the commonest agent taken in overdose in the UK.

Small amounts of NAPQI produced during therapeutic paracetamol use can be detoxified safely in glutathione-dependent reactions, but after overdose formation of NAPQI outstrips availability of glutathione, resulting in covalent binding of NAPQI to hepatocytes, culminating in cell death.

Firstly, intravenous NAC is commonly associated with adverse effects, the most common being nausea, vomiting and anaphylactoid reactions [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="10699" xml_f="10700" txt_i="5039" txt_f="5040">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10707" xml_f="10708" txt_i="5040" txt_f="5041">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="10739" xml_f="10740" txt_i="5041" txt_f="5042">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10747" xml_f="11069" txt_i="5042" txt_f="5364">]. Anaphylactoid reactions appear related to the rate of infusion of NAC and its concentration in blood. Thus they are most common during, or soon after, the initial high dose infusion.

Since it is difficult to discharge patients after 22.00 and before 08.00, currently any patient presenting between 20:00 and 08:00 is likely to spend a second night in hospital if NAC is administered over 20.25 h and bloods are checked at end of treatment. This effectively means that any patient in whom NAC therapy is commenced is likely to be in hospital well over 24 hours, despite the majority never developing any evidence of liver injury. With a shorter infusion regimen, e.g. over 12 h, patients presenting at any time before 08:00 could potentially be discharged before 22.00, thus reducing the length of hospital stay for a significant proportion of patients. Based on our clinical experience in Edinburgh and Newcastle we estimate that more than 40% of hospital bed occupancy due to paracetamol overdose is due to treatment with NAC. Applying this to the UK, it would amount to 32,000 bed-days/year. We estimate that use of a shorter-duration regimen may potentially save more than 10,000 bed-days per annum across the UK.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12980" xml_f="13980" txt_i="6954" txt_f="7954">We hypothesised that it should be possible to design an alternative method for administering NAC, in which the antidote was delivered using a simpler regimen and for a shorter time, while still providing adequate plasma concentrations of acetylcysteine for liver protection. We approached funders with the view to conducting an initial study of a new modified NAC regimen in patients with paracetamol poisoning. They indicated it would be necessary to do a smaller preliminary study focused on measuring rates of adverse reactions with both regimens, before a larger formal clinical trial of efficacy could be considered. Since no clinical trial had been done in acute paracetamol poisoning in the UK since the 1970s, they also stressed the importance of assessing the practicalities of such a study if a new dose regimen, or possibly even new antidotes, were to be developed.

Hospitalisation due to paracetamol overdose accounted for approximately 80,000 bed days in the UK in 2005–2006 (source: Hospital Episode Statistics &amp; ISD Scotland).

This modified regimen administers the same total dose in 2 separate infusions instead of 3 and, therefore, may reduce the risks of error associated with preparing infusions. Ideally, such a regimen would be used in routine clinical practice after an adequately powered efficacy study had been performed. In theory, the slower initial delivery of NAC may result in less effective early generation of hepatic glutathione for detoxification of NAPQI, although any difference between the current 1 h and proposed and 2 h regime is likely to be small. Also, the shorter total duration of the infusion may mean that delivery of NAC ceases before all NAPQI has been formed and detoxified, leaving some patients inadequately treated. Such patients would be expected to have detectable paracetamol concentrations at the end of the 12 h infusion and the frequency of this finding is being assessed in this clinical trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47196" xml_f="47666" txt_i="37949" txt_f="38419">Ideally, any efficacy study comparing new and conventional acetylcysteine regimens would need to be powered to establish non-inferiority.

Patients with self-harm are a potentially challenging group to recruit into a clinical trial. We had undertaken a survey of our patients with paracetamol poisoning in Edinburgh prior to undertaking the study in order to assess their views on being approached for consent, and the need for additional blood sampling. Many of these patients had received NAC in the past and were therefore aware of the adverse effects caused. Patients being treated with acetylcysteine in Edinburgh were approached to seek their views about whether they would wish to take part in a clinical trial involving the modified acetylcysteine regime. They were given a 1-page summary of the research, asked about their willingness to participate and their views about consent. Patients overwhelmingly thought the research would be useful and they would be willing to take part. With regards to consenting procedures, if they were unable to give informed consent, most preferred that, if a relative did not accompany them, the decision to involve them in the study were taken by the treating clinician. We therefore adopted the policy that ethics consent would not be sought from relatives by telephone, but only from relatives accompanying the patient and therefore already aware of their presentation. We also considered the use of an alternative personal legal representative, proposing the senior nurse in the hospital, but the ethics committee felt this was also unacceptable. This resulted in a reduction in the number of potential recruits into the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49340" xml_f="50225" txt_i="40081" txt_f="40966">As detailed in the section on study amendments, we originally believed that most patients would take paracetamol overdose over a period of less than an hour. It quickly became clear that many of our patients, even though they took their tablets at one sitting, took these over longer than the hour originally specified in the trial documentation. We believe this is a novel finding and may explain some of the difficulties reported in using paracetamol nomograms, particularly if blood samples are taken around four hours after commencement of drug ingestion. The ethics committee accepted a change in overall ingestion time to less than two hours as representing the time that would be used for including patients within the trial. We also extended the inclusion time to 36 h from ingestion to fall in line with national advice provided by the UK National Poisons Information Service.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="50232" xml_f="50362" txt_i="40967" txt_f="41097">Assessing severity of anaphylactoid reactions will be based on the 5-point scale proposed by the World Allergy Association (WAA) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"><offsets xml_i="50394" xml_f="50396" txt_i="41097" txt_f="41099">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="50403" xml_f="50856" txt_i="41099" txt_f="41552">]. In this scale the most severe reaction (Grade 5) is death. Although rarely reported, death is extremely unlikely with NAC in this study. Gastrointestinal features, including nausea, are also included by the WAA, and it is inappropriate to include this in an antiemetic efficacy study of the current design. We have therefore adopted a 3-grade study assessment based on the WAA categories, and using organ domains as the basis of the severity grading.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="50863" xml_f="51269" txt_i="41553" txt_f="41959">Recruitment targets were necessarily set higher than required for the actual analysis since we had no data to judge drop-out rates and adopted a 20% overall drop-out as a potential worst case scenario when calculating trial target recruitment.
