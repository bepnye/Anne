Instructors were recruited through the North Carolina Area Agencies on Aging; all had a history of some type of community-based health work, but they did not necessarily have experience working with people with arthritis. The instructor recruitment was designed to select people representative of those working with state health agencies in community health settings. Instructors received teaching materials and a CD-ROM, completed an online test, and received certification from Human Kinetics, distributors of the course, prior to beginning their classes. In response to an instructor's inquiry about general arthritis information, the ALED project managers provided all instructors with free pamphlets from the Arthritis Foundation and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Skin Diseases covering a variety of arthritis-related topics (e.g., arthritis and fatigue, back pain, hip replacement).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12941" xml_f="13718" txt_i="8550" txt_f="9327">In addition to the ALED training, instructors received information about the study, and all completed National Institutes of Health human subjects training.

They also recommended providing instructors with additional arthritis resources (e.g., handouts) and access to someone working at an arthritis program, such as a coordinator or director of a state arthritis program (</offsets><xref rid="T3" ref-type="table"><offsets xml_i="20890" xml_f="20897" txt_i="16034" txt_f="16041">Table 3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20904" xml_f="20906" txt_i="16041" txt_f="16043">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20913" xml_f="21362" txt_i="16044" txt_f="16493">The standard ALED course does not provide ongoing instructor support after instructors complete their training. As noted in the methods section, however, instructors in the RCT were provided with a toll-free number and a listserv to give them an opportunity to correspond with project directors and with each other. During the conference call, instructors emphasized the helpfulness of the toll-free number; however, few reported using the listserv.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21384" xml_f="21399" txt_i="16495" txt_f="16510">Program content</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21410" xml_f="22204" txt_i="16511" txt_f="17305">A common theme in the comments of both instructors and participants was that the course could be made more relevant for people with arthritis by addressing how pain acts as a barrier to their engaging in physical activity. A significant component of the ALED program is to encourage participants to create goals that are attainable, given their lifestyle and current physical condition. Instructors were able to reinforce this need for attainable physical activity goals and elicited discussion among class participants about how their arthritis affected their participation in physical activity. Participants reported that because of the approach of the program and their interaction with their classmates, they were not afraid of hurting themselves or pushing themselves beyond a safe limit (</offsets><xref rid="T3" ref-type="table"><offsets xml_i="22236" xml_f="22243" txt_i="17305" txt_f="17312">Table 3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22250" xml_f="22252" txt_i="17312" txt_f="17314">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22259" xml_f="22763" txt_i="17315" txt_f="17819">Some participants said they appreciated a naturalistic approach to managing arthritis pain because they wanted to avoid taking more medication. Participants also generally reported that they liked discussing lifestyle factors beyond physical activity in the class, particularly factors such as diet and nutrition. Many indicated that they would have liked to learn more about weight management, the role of diet in managing arthritis symptoms, and how to identify healthy foods for people with arthritis.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22785" xml_f="22798" txt_i="17821" txt_f="17834">ALED textbook</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22809" xml_f="23653" txt_i="17835" txt_f="18679">As noted above, each participant received an ALED textbook. When asked, most participants suggested modifications to the textbook to make it more appropriate for people with arthritis. The most frequently suggested modifications involved addressing pain management, exercise intensity, and the appropriateness of different types of exercise that target various forms of arthritis or pinpoint the most affected body parts. Some participants did not feel that the textbook needed to be modified and explained that the instructor did a good job of tailoring the class to meet the unique needs of people with arthritis. Others stated that while arthritis-specific modifications to the textbook may not be helpful to them, such changes may benefit those who have more severe arthritis-related problems or different forms of arthritis than they have.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23681" xml_f="23766" txt_i="18682" txt_f="18767">Influence of pain level and difficulty in ADL performance on participants' responses </offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23777" xml_f="24217" txt_i="18768" txt_f="19208">We were also interested in how participants' level of pain and level of ADL difficulty may have affected their recommendations for arthritis-specific modifications to the course. From the 30 participants in our qualitative analysis, we selected those with a baseline HAQ-DI score greater than or equal to 1.0 and a VAS pain score greater than 40 to represent people with moderate or higher amounts of arthritis-related disability and pain (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"><offsets xml_i="24249" xml_f="24251" txt_i="19208" txt_f="19210">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24258" xml_f="25206" txt_i="19210" txt_f="20158">). Nine participants met these criteria. We found no obvious commonality among the responses of these participants. Some of them had had arthritis for many years and felt that they knew a lot about the disease and were already familiar with the arthritis-specific information discussed in class. Others who also had had the disease for many years were unfamiliar with the arthritis-specific information discussed in the course, such as what rheumatologists are and how exercise can be beneficial for people with arthritis. A few of these nine participants reported that their arthritis had become so severe that they had previously felt they could not exercise at all but that the ALED course showed them that they could be physically active again. All nine reported that they felt safe in the class because they trusted the instructor, knew their own limits, and learned that they could incorporate physical activity into their lives "bit by bit."</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="25234" xml_f="25244" txt_i="20161" txt_f="20171">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="25255" xml_f="26602" txt_i="20172" txt_f="21519">The results of our qualitative evaluation of ALED show that it is possible to take a program that was developed for a general population and implement it safely and appropriately in a population of people with arthritis. However, they also indicated that instructors without a background in working with people with arthritis would benefit from more specific information about arthritis and pain management strategies during training and from having access to arthritis brochures and an arthritis expert while teaching the course (as the RCT instructors did). Participants and instructors both generally felt that the course content could be improved by adding some arthritis-specific information (particularly regarding pain management) and by providing more relevant examples of physical activities appropriate for people with arthritis. Overall, though, the course as offered appeared to be robust and well received by participants with different types of arthritis and various levels of disease activity and to be a useful option for promoting physical activity among people with arthritis. Aspects of the course that were particularly appealing to people with arthritis, such as encouraging them to tailor their goals and activities to their own situation and to exercise "bit by bit," may also appeal to people with other chronic conditions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26609" xml_f="27928" txt_i="21520" txt_f="22839">This investigation may have been limited by participant recall because many of the interviews were conducted nearly 6 months after the participants completed the course. The time lapse sometimes made it hard for participants to remember details about their experiences in the class, particularly in regard to the course book, with as much candor as those interviewed soon after the class ended. Another limitation is that we interviewed only the participants who attended at least half of the classes offered, the completers. Therefore, we may be missing a valuable perspective from the noncompleters. However, from the attendance records kept by the course instructors, we do know that 43% of the noncompleters dropped out early in the course and never returned. These participants cited personal or family illness, scheduling conflicts, or the course not being a good match as primary reasons for dropping out of the program. The remaining noncompleters missed classes at various points throughout the entire course because of personal or family illness, scheduling conflicts (doctor appointments most frequently cited) and other outside factors. A final limitation to our findings is that they may not be generalizable to men, given that 90% of our participants were women. Women account for 60% of arthritis cases (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="27959" xml_f="27960" txt_i="22839" txt_f="22840">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27967" xml_f="28133" txt_i="22840" txt_f="23006">), so our participants are more heavily weighted for women, and it is possible that the program may need different or additional modifications for men with arthritis.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28140" xml_f="28430" txt_i="23007" txt_f="23297">The lessons learned from our evaluation of ALED may be useful in modifying other physical activity programs designed for general populations and for use by people with arthritis, particularly in ensuring that they address the health issues that are most important to people with arthritis (</offsets><xref rid="T4" ref-type="table"><offsets xml_i="28462" xml_f="28469" txt_i="23297" txt_f="23304">Table 4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="28476" xml_f="29699" txt_i="23304" txt_f="24527">). We recommend that anyone contemplating using an existing physical activity or behavior modification program that has not been developed specifically for people with arthritis consider the following modifications: 1) provide arthritis-specific education for instructors, with an emphasis on pain management; 2) provide instructors with arthritis-related resources and contacts with arthritis experts; 3) modify program material to include examples of physical activity appropriate for people with arthritis; 4) enhance program material with information on how to exercise while protecting arthritic joints and managing arthritis symptoms; and 5) incorporate information on dietary and other complementary strategies for alleviating arthritis symptoms. Our findings also indicate that physical activity classes for people with arthritis should encourage participants to exercise at their own pace, "bit by bit" if they prefer, and for instructors to create a class environment that fosters communication and friendship among class members. In conclusion, expanding the menu of community-based physical activity programs geared toward people with arthritis is a promising approach to increasing their health and well-being.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This project was supported by a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Association of Medical Colleges (grant number MM-0644-04).
