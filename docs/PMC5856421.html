Routinely used electrocautery produces more smoke, which masks the operating field, thereby prolongs the surgery and posing an increased risk of gallbladder (GB) perforation. The titanium clips used for clipping the cystic artery and cystic duct have a risk of slippage, which may lead to bleeding, and an increased risk for bile leakage. In addition, it may act as a nidus for stone formation. Advanced energy sources, such as the harmonic scalpel, though expensive, may provide the advantage of shorter operating time by reducing smoke, bloodless dissection in the GB bed, lower risk of bleeding from the cystic artery due to secure vessel sealing, and avoiding the use of a larger number of titanium clips. However, evidence to substantiate this advantage is limited.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5251" xml_f="5254" txt_i="895" txt_f="898">Aim</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5261" xml_f="5444" txt_i="899" txt_f="1082">To compare the operating time and perioperative complications between conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) and harmonic scalpel assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy (HLC).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5451" xml_f="5462" txt_i="1083" txt_f="1094">Methodology</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5469" xml_f="6560" txt_i="1095" txt_f="2186">All consecutive patients who underwent elective LC were included.

However, the cystic duct and cystic artery are divided after the application of conventional clips due to a fear of cystic artery and cystic duct leakage.

The cystic duct was divided after clipping with conventional titanium clips. This was carried out to reduce the risk of bile leakage from the ligated cystic duct using the harmonic scalpel, as sealing the harmonic scalpel is limited to lumens with 5 mm thickness.

The perforation also makes the operating procedure difficult and long due to the continuous leakage of bile from the perforated GB during the dissection of GB from the liver bed. Causes for GB perforation are laceration due to grasper traction and lateral tissue damage due to electrocautery dissection. The harmonic scalpel reduces the lateral thermal spread and decreases the risk of GB perforation.
