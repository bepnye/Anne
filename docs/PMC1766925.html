Personnel conduct a broad range of activities, including clerical, financial, policy, scientific, information technology, engineering, maintenance, cleaning, and facilities management. Regional public hospital and community health services are administered by regional health authorities that are in turn administered by the NSW Department of Health. The sampling frame included employees whose contact details were listed on one of five telephone directory databases for employees of the main NSW Department of Health administration (1159 employees), an urban regional health authority (9629 employees), a mixed urban/rural health authority (1840 employees), and two rural health authorities (3560 employees).

Other than the letter from the Chief Health Officer, there was no incentive for participation. Up to six follow-up reminder calls were made to non-responders.

We found that a bar graph with 95% confidence intervals clearly out-performed dot graphs with 95% confidence intervals (sometimes called "hi-lo-close" graphs), particularly among those without university qualifications. For another type of dot graph, which had each dot connected by a dashed line to the x axis, but had no confidence intervals, a horizontal bar graph performed equally well, and even showed a marginal improvement for those without a university qualification. We therefore recommend the use of bar graphs over dot graphs for the kinds of data presentations examined in this study. This recommendation is further supported by the likely greater familiarity of bar graphs for general readers and the ready availability of bar graphs in common, less sophisticated, statistical software products.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30552" xml_f="30668" txt_i="24145" txt_f="24261">Pie charts are often derided because their non-linear format inhibits precise estimation of statistical quantities [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"><offsets xml_i="30700" xml_f="30702" txt_i="24261" txt_f="24263">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30709" xml_f="30710" txt_i="24263" txt_f="24264">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"><offsets xml_i="30742" xml_f="30744" txt_i="24264" txt_f="24266">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30751" xml_f="30850" txt_i="24266" txt_f="24365">].

Several interpretation tasks explored the consequences of using differing scales in adjacent graphs. Many respondents, particularly those without university qualifications, appeared to answer questions based on visual relativities rather than from studying the labels on the axes. For tasks comparing the relative magnitude of quantities between the two graphs, a matching scale range on each graph greatly improved comprehension.

Despite the randomised design, there were differences between the control and intervention groups in terms of self-rated visual ability and frequency of graph use. Intervention participants were somewhat more likely to rate themselves as frequent graph users than control participants and more likely to rate themselves as having good visual ability. However, the observed differences may reflect the fact that many of the intervention graphs were more easily understood than the control graphs. These questions were asked at the end of the questionnaire, and intervention participants may have felt more comfortable rating themselves more highly on these characteristics.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33433" xml_f="33833" txt_i="26728" txt_f="27128">Because in some cases we made more than one change to the intervention graph, we could not completely attribute the impact of a single change to a single outcome. However, we aimed to minimise this difficulty by making the interpretation tasks as specific as possible to a specific intervention. This approach balanced respondent burden with the need to test many interventions for many graph styles.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33840" xml_f="34447" txt_i="27129" txt_f="27736">The results we obtained are probably an overestimate of levels of comprehension that would be achieved in the general population. People working in public health and policy-related areas represented approximately one-fifth of respondents. These employees would be most likely to require information on population health statistics for their work. Many other people in the health system would have a professional understanding of health and medicine. Two-thirds of respondents in our study had university qualifications, compared with approximately one-fifth of the population aged 25â64 years in Australia [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"><offsets xml_i="34479" xml_f="34481" txt_i="27736" txt_f="27738">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34488" xml_f="34490" txt_i="27738" txt_f="27740">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34497" xml_f="35129" txt_i="27741" txt_f="28373">The graphs we used were taken out of the context of their original report, and we recognise that much of the explanatory information required to understand the graph might have been contained in the surrounding text. However, if readers unfamiliar with the subject are required to hunt for explanatory information, they may weary of obtaining knowledge about population health. Publishers of scientific journals often require graphs to be able to "stand alone", and we support this objective, but would add that for documents intended for a public audience, the graphs should stand alone for a broad sector of the target readership.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35136" xml_f="35615" txt_i="28374" txt_f="28853">Finally, in some cases we removed information contained in the control graph to test the effect of simplifying the graph.

This study provides new evidence to support a range of recommendations on how to improve the design of graphs. This represents a clear opportunity to improve delivery of public health messages through graphs to a wider sector of the population. However, it is clear that, regardless of graph design, concepts such as age standardisation and confidence intervals were not understood by the majority of participants, regardless of their level of education. This is a vexed problem, because these concepts are crucial to accurate interpretation of statistical information in population health and epidemiology. There remains, therefore, an opportunity for inventive solutions to deliver the messages implied by these manipulations without increasing the difficulty of interpreting the graph.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="36630" xml_f="36649" txt_i="29813" txt_f="29832">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36660" xml_f="36720" txt_i="29833" txt_f="29893">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="36742" xml_f="36764" txt_i="29895" txt_f="29917">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36775" xml_f="37191" txt_i="29918" txt_f="30334">DM managed the project, advised on the population health and epidemiological requirements of the project, and drafted the manuscript.
