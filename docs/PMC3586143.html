The peak areas of vandetanib and its metabolites relative to the internal standard were calculated and the concentration was determined by reference to the relevant calibration curve. The lower limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for vandetanib, and 1 ng/mL for N-desmethylvandetanib and vandetanib N-oxide. For vandetanib, mean accuracy was 105–110% and precision was 6.6–7.4%.

Although reduced exposure to vandetanib has the potential to reduce its efficacy, a clear relationship between exposure and clinical effect has not been defined for vandetanib. Since N-desmethylvandetanib is of similar potency to vandetanib, increased exposure to the metabolite may compensate to some extent for reduced exposure to the parent compound.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43475" xml_f="43672" txt_i="35110" txt_f="35307">In Study B, CYP3A4 was inhibited by administration of itraconazole 200 mg/day for 4 days before dosing with vandetanib.
