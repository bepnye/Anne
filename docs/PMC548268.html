Amongst various factors that influence the amount of postoperative drainage, the negative suction pressure applied to the drain has been reported to be of great significance. While a high negative suction pressure is expected to drain the collection and reduce the dead space promptly, it may also prevent the leaking lymphatics from closing and lead to increased drainage from the wound. Against this background a prospective randomized clinical study was conducted to compare the amount and duration of drainage between a half negative suction and full vacuum suction drainage in patients following modified radical mastectomy.

The two groups were comparable in respect of age, weight and type of operation i.e. modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Following complete routine and metastatic work up, all patients received three cycles of Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) using CAF regime (Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, 5-Fluorouracil) and underwent Patey's modified radical mastectomy after three weeks of the last cycle. Surgery was performed by the same surgical team comprising of five surgeons (two senior and three resident surgeons) using a standardized technique with electro cautery. Axillary dissection was done up to level- III in all the cases. The boundaries of axillary dissection were defined by superior limit as the posterolateral border of the Pectoralis major muscle and axillary vein, medial limit being clavipectoral fascia or Hallstead's ligament, lateral limit as the anterior border of lattismus dorsi and the inferior limit being the angular vein joining the thoracodorsal vein. The long thoracic and thoracodorsal nerves were identified, dissected and preserved. Two silicone tube drains (12Fr) (one axillary and pectoral) were inserted in all the patients. All resected specimens were examined and the lymph nodes dissected, counted and assessed histo-pathologically for metastases. No patient received intra-operative blood transfusion. Both the drains were connected to a single 600 ml suction bottle (Romovac -Romson). In-group A (n = 50), drainage was performed using complete vacuum negative suction (700 g/m2) and in-group B (n = 35) with half vacuum suction drainage (350 g/m2).

However in the present study it was observed that high suction caused prolonged drainage, which can possibly be explained by the hypothesis that high negative suction may not allow, leaking lymphatics to close. Therefore no suction or high suction drainage both may contribute to the same result that is higher incidence of seroma formation and longer hospital stay. To strike a balance between not having suction at all and having a very high or full negative suction, half negative suction drainage was used in the present study to achieve a shorter hospital stay without any increase in the rate of post operative seroma formation. The external compression dressings in the first forty-eight hours perhaps helped in the adherence of the flaps and reduction of dead space without compromising on the shoulder mobility. This was found to effectively reduce the Hospital stay and also did not increase the postoperative morbidity as compared to high (full) negative suction group.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22437" xml_f="22448" txt_i="16320" txt_f="16331">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22459" xml_f="23148" txt_i="16332" txt_f="17018">Reducing the negative suction pressure applied to the drain (making it half suction) along with external compression dressings applied for first 48 hours can significantly reduce drainage from the axilla following modified radical mastectomy without increasing the incidence of seroma formation as was observed in this randomized prospective clinical study. The hospital stay was reduced considerably compared to a matched group with full suction drain (p &lt; 0.001). Half suction drain following axillary dissection in patients with carcinoma breast may thus be recommended as an effective approach to reducing the hospital stay and the cost of treatment without adding to the morbidity.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23170" xml_f="23189" txt_i="17020" txt_f="17039">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23200" xml_f="23260" txt_i="17040" txt_f="17100">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23282" xml_f="23304" txt_i="17102" txt_f="17124">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23315" xml_f="23742" txt_i="17125" txt_f="17552">CM was the surgeon in charge of the project and prepared the study design.
