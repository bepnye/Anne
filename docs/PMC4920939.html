He argued that, to inform implementation and scale-up, studies need to reflect on the real life setting of the trial, and insisted that complex interventions in low-income country settings entail challenges that could not easily be predicted. In 2014, we outlined the steps we took in launching a large collaborative randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Free State, South Africa, to better understand the determinants of successful implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO)-International Labour Office (ILO)-UNAIDS guidelines on improving access for healthcare workers (HCWs) to prevention and care for tuberculosis (TB) and HIV (</offsets><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8706" xml_f="8708" txt_i="4034" txt_f="4036">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8715" xml_f="9318" txt_i="4036" txt_f="4639">). We argued that such studies need to be seen as iterative, rather than having distinct start and end dates, precisely because, as Reynolds et al. observed, new issues always arise. The present article updates this discussion, presenting findings after the 1-year review that led us to prematurely end the operational stage of this RCT and attend to the major barriers encountered. Like Reynolds et al., we believe that identifying the real-world challenges that emerge are important findings worth sharing, and like Fuller and Potvin, our experience re-emphasizes the importance of the social context.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9325" xml_f="9350" txt_i="4640" txt_f="4665">As described previously (</offsets><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9386" xml_f="9388" txt_i="4665" txt_f="4667">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9395" xml_f="9604" txt_i="4667" txt_f="4876">), after almost 7 years of international relationship-building and preliminary research, a 2-year pragmatic, cluster RCT was launched in July 2013 at 27 hospitals in the Free State province, South Africa (See </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001"><offsets xml_i="9637" xml_f="9643" txt_i="4876" txt_f="4882">Fig. 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9650" xml_f="10682" txt_i="4882" txt_f="5914">). The purpose was to ascertain whether, and under what conditions, a combined workforce and workplace intervention can improve health outcomes and strengthen occupational health and infection control services. The study aimed to ascertain whether such an intervention could: 1) improve the health outcomes of the healthcare workforce, as defined by the incidence of TB disease and overall mortality, and sick-time and turnover rates; 2) increase clinical service uptake at the occupational health units (OHUs), as determined by staff usage of services for TB and HIV; and 3) strengthen occupational health and TB infection control practices, as assessed by the frequency, findings, and actions from workplace assessments for TB infection control. These assessments or workplace audits were to be routinely conducted, according to national and international norms, as well as following any time a HCW contracts TB, which were referred to as ‘issue-based’.

A coin toss was used to randomly allocate one of each pair into the intervention arm. Both intervention and comparison sites were instructed to conduct bi-annual and issue-based workplace infection control assessments; they were also instructed to offer their workforce confidential TB and HIV counseling and testing as well as TB treatment and prophylaxis for HIV-positive staff. Intervention sites were, in addition, instructed to conduct quarterly workplace assessments and seek assistance from national experts to implement recommended infection control practices, as well as to offer their workforce HIV treatment at the OHU.

However, the laboratory personnel had not been included in the pre-trial training and protocol development, which explains their less-than-perfect cooperation. Of course, there were many constraints on healthcare in Free State during that time. Cash flow was a problem, with a lack of the resources to both recruit sufficient staff and address infrastructural issues. As such, it cannot be concluded that better communication and more careful attention to confidentiality would have resolved the challenges encountered. As a discussion of the global economic forces is beyond the scope of the report, suffice it to state that the infrastructural support for this RCT was insufficient.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33524" xml_f="33683" txt_i="25079" txt_f="25238">Our finding of the importance of a database echoes what was found by other researchers, both for research and operational purposes; for example, Reddy et al. (</offsets><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="33719" xml_f="33721" txt_i="25238" txt_f="25240">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33728" xml_f="33967" txt_i="25240" txt_f="25479">) noted that the lack of a centralized database for the collection and integration of related data for easy data accessibility and analysis accounted for the limited progress in TB control. In their analysis of data quality, Dixon et al. (</offsets><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34003" xml_f="34005" txt_i="25479" txt_f="25481">35</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34012" xml_f="35157" txt_i="25481" txt_f="26626">) noted that resources need to be invested in building information infrastructure to address the poor data quality that exists in clinical information systems. Indeed, we were struck by the widespread agreement among our interviewees supporting the implementation of an electronic database to provide data not only for evidence-based policies but also for the day-to-day operational monitoring of workplace hazard remediation and OH service provision. On one hand, in retrospect, we feel that it was a mistake to have deferred the installation of an electronic database, because the time-consuming requirement for busy occupational health personnel to complete paper-based research forms was the Achilles heel in our plan. On the other hand, as shown by the inconsistencies in the PERSAL data, the lack of IT personnel in the Free State's Department of Health would have made this difficult. Since this analysis was completed, the Free State has strengthened its IT staffing and is now working with the National Institute for Occupational Health to solidify an implementation schedule, which will help with ultimate scale-up and sustainability (</offsets><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="35193" xml_f="35195" txt_i="26626" txt_f="26628">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35202" xml_f="35204" txt_i="26628" txt_f="26630">, </offsets><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="35240" xml_f="35242" txt_i="26630" txt_f="26632">36</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35249" xml_f="35251" txt_i="26632" txt_f="26634">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35258" xml_f="35683" txt_i="26635" txt_f="27060">Finally, we note that the clinical data indicated that the OHUs identified at least 23 new cases of undiagnosed TB among HCWs. Given the problems with data recording, this can be considered a potentially large underestimate of the true problem of TB in HCWs. The percent positive among all HCWs screened was 1,676 cases per 100,000 workers, more than double the current estimate of 834 per 100,000 in the general population (</offsets><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="35719" xml_f="35721" txt_i="27060" txt_f="27062">37</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35728" xml_f="35899" txt_i="27062" txt_f="27233">). This is consistent with the findings from many studies that estimate that HCWs have at least a two- to three-fold increased risk compared to the population they serve (</offsets><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="35935" xml_f="35937" txt_i="27233" txt_f="27235">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35944" xml_f="35945" txt_i="27235" txt_f="27236">–</offsets><xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="35981" xml_f="35983" txt_i="27236" txt_f="27238">41</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35990" xml_f="36483" txt_i="27238" txt_f="27731">). Implementation of a comprehensive HIV and TB workplace policy for health workers in line with existing National policies is indeed still very much needed in South Africa, as rates of these diseases are still of extreme concern. Although we had to end this RCT prematurely, the work done before and during the trial helped raise the awareness amongst provincial health decision-makers of the need to develop and implement the needed Standard Operating Procedures in line with these policies.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0005"><title><offsets xml_i="36539" xml_f="36550" txt_i="27733" txt_f="27744">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36561" xml_f="37296" txt_i="27745" txt_f="28480">A greater understanding of the various challenges and constraints developed as a result of this trial, and what was learned from this final component of the study constitutes an important contribution of knowledge to decision-makers in the Free State, as well as South Africa, and beyond. As a major goal of research is to influence policy and practice, the trial can be seen as successful in this regard despite the problems encountered in the quantitative data. Indeed, there was a widespread sense that the study increased OHU utilization for TB and HIV services. It remains to be seen whether this change is sustainable and leads to an overall reduction of deaths, sick-time, and turnover rates amongst all staff at the facilities.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors express great gratitude to all the health workers in the Free State province of South Africa, particularly the staff of the occupational health units.

We conclude that designing sustainable complex population health intervention studies requires implementation of user-friendly data collection systems to serve both operational and study needs.</p></sec></ack><sec id="S0006"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AY led the conceptualization and writing of this manuscript.
