We will determine what percentage of children were coded as croup using the standard codes met a formal definition for croup (acute onset of stridor associated with a "seal-like" barking cough). Also to explore whether some hospitals use other ICD9 codes for children with croup, we will generate a list of potential alternative codes. Using this list of potential alternative ICD9 codes, we will review a random selection of medical records using these codes.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="54594" xml_f="54637" txt_i="44156" txt_f="44195">Clinical &amp; psychosocial burden outcomes</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="54657" xml_f="54669" txt_i="44196" txt_f="44208">RMO database</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="54680" xml_f="55021" txt_i="44209" txt_f="44550">We are maintaining a database of all children diagnosed as having croup whose parents refused, were missed, or are otherwise excluded.

Alternatively, if the experimental interventions yield increased benefits at increased costs, a ratio of the incremental cost per outcome gained will be calculated. And last, if the experimental interventions yield decreased benefits but are associated with increased or equal costs, the standard dissemination strategy will be judged to be the most cost-effective.
