However, if the response rate is low, the respondents may represent a biased sample of the population. It is therefore desirable that the response rate to a postal survey be as high as possible, to ensure that there is sufficient statistical power and the findings are representative. One factor that may influence response rate is whether the covering letter that is sent out with the questionnaire is hand signed or bears a photocopied or printed signature. The rationale is that individuals who receive a hand signed covering letter may feel that the letter is more personalised to them, and hence may be more likely to complete and return the questionnaire than those who receive a letter with a printed signature.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5802" xml_f="5830" txt_i="2301" txt_f="2329">A recent systematic review [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="5861" xml_f="5862" txt_i="2329" txt_f="2330">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5869" xml_f="6783" txt_i="2330" txt_f="3244">] included a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of personalisation of covering letters accompanying postal questionnaires. The results suggested that an approach in the form of personalised letters, questionnaires or envelopes improved final response rates by a modest amount (odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval (1.07, 1.26)). However, various methods of personalisation such as hand written versus typed salutations and hand written versus typed postscripts were used by the studies in this analysis. Only five of the 48 studies in this analysis evaluated the effects of hand signing letters versus duplicated or printed signatures, and none of these involved a questionnaire sent to health professionals. These studies also had methodological problems such as low response rates and small sample sizes. None has suggested any major advantage to one group or the other [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="6814" xml_f="6815" txt_i="3244" txt_f="3245">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6822" xml_f="6823" txt_i="3245" txt_f="3246">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="6854" xml_f="6855" txt_i="3246" txt_f="3247">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6862" xml_f="6864" txt_i="3247" txt_f="3249">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6871" xml_f="7181" txt_i="3250" txt_f="3560">The randomised controlled trial reported here aimed to determine whether a hand written or computer printed signature on the covering letter influenced the proportion of questionnaires returned or the time taken to return them, in a survey of clinical practice among obstetricians and gynaecologists in the UK.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="7222" xml_f="7229" txt_i="3562" txt_f="3569">Methods</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7249" xml_f="7273" txt_i="3570" txt_f="3594">Setting and participants</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7284" xml_f="7416" txt_i="3595" txt_f="3727">This study was conducted as part of a national postal survey of surgical techniques used in caesarean section operations in the UK [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="7447" xml_f="7448" txt_i="3727" txt_f="3728">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7455" xml_f="8062" txt_i="3728" txt_f="4335">].
