Traditional dental services have had limited success in reducing this disease burden. Interventions based on motivational interviewing have been shown to impact positively dental health behaviours and could facilitate the prevention of re-occurrence of dental caries in this high-risk population. The objective of the study is to evaluate whether a new, dental nurse-led service, delivered using a brief negotiated interview based on motivational interviewing, is a more cost-effective service than treatment as usual, in reducing the re-occurrence of dental decay in young children with previous dental extractions.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7920" xml_f="7934" txt_i="777" txt_f="791">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7945" xml_f="8903" txt_i="792" txt_f="1750">This 2-year, two-arm, multicentre, randomised controlled trial will include 224 child participants, initially aged 5 to 7 years, who are scheduled to have one or more primary teeth extracted for dental caries under general anaesthesia (GA), relative analgesia (RA: inhalation sedation) or local anaesthesia (LA). The trial will be conducted in University Dental Hospitals, Secondary Care Centres or other providers of dental extraction services across the United Kingdom. The intervention will include a brief negotiated interview (based on the principles of motivational interviewing) delivered between enrolment and 6 weeks post-extraction, followed by directed prevention in primary dental care. Participants will be followed up for 2 years. The main outcome measure will be the dental caries experienced by 2 years post-enrolment at the level of dentine involvement on any tooth in either dentition, which had been caries-free at the baseline assessment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8925" xml_f="8935" txt_i="1752" txt_f="1762">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8946" xml_f="9329" txt_i="1763" txt_f="2146">The participants are a hard-to-reach group in which secondary prevention is a challenge.

Those delivering the intervention are dental nurses, reflecting moves to skill mix in dental care, which is, to date, a rare feature in dental trials. The participants are a hard to reach group in which secondary prevention is a challenge. Children scheduled for extractions are less likely to have been taken to attend their dentist for regular preventive treatment. This lack of engagement with dental care makes the children and families scheduled for extraction particularly difficult to recruit to an RCT. Variations in service delivery between sites have also added to the challenges in implementing the Dental RECUR protocol during the recruitment phase.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42402" xml_f="43050" txt_i="31255" txt_f="31903">The protocol has been refined to allow randomisation and intervention delivery to occur at any appointment after enrolment and up to 6 weeks post-extraction. Participants can therefore participate on the trial whilst attending their routine appointments or have the option to schedule an additional appointment if preferred. This design removes some of the barriers to participation associated with attendance at additional appointments, for example travel and parents’ needing to take time off work. The flexibility of the design also allows staff working on the trial to fit trial requirements around existing appointment schedules at their site.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title><offsets xml_i="43083" xml_f="43095" txt_i="31905" txt_f="31917">Trial status</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="43106" xml_f="43154" txt_i="31918" txt_f="31966">This trial is currently recruiting participants.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec21"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_1010_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
