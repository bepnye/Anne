Less than 15% of children and young people with T1DM in the UK meet the recommended glycaemic target. Self-management education programmes for adults with T1DM improve clinical and psychological outcomes, but none have been evaluated in the paediatric population. KICk-OFF is a 5-day structured education course for 11-year-olds to 16- year-olds with T1DM. It was developed with input from young people, parents, teachers and educationalists.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6867" xml_f="6887" txt_i="748" txt_f="768">Methods and analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6898" xml_f="7809" txt_i="769" txt_f="1677">36 paediatric diabetes centres across the UK randomised into intervention and control arms. Up to 560 participants were recruited prior to centre randomisation. KICk-OFF courses are delivered in the intervention centres, with standard care continued in the control arm. Primary outcomes are change in glycaemic control (HbA1c) and quality of life between baseline and 6 months postintervention, and the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia. Sustained change in self-management behaviour is assessed by follow-up at 12 and 24 months. Health economic analysis will be undertaken. Data will be reported according to the CONSORT statement for cluster-randomised clinical trials. All analyses will be by intention-to-treat with a two-sided p value of &lt;0.05 being regarded as statistically significant. The study commenced in 2008. Data collection from participants is ongoing and the study will be completed in 2013.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7831" xml_f="7837" txt_i="1679" txt_f="1685">Ethics</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7848" xml_f="7919" txt_i="1686" txt_f="1757">The study has been approved by the Sheffield Research Ethics Committee.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7941" xml_f="7954" txt_i="1759" txt_f="1772">Dissemination</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7965" xml_f="8032" txt_i="1773" txt_f="1840">Results will be reported in peer reviewed journals and conferences.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8054" xml_f="8072" txt_i="1842" txt_f="1860">Trial registration</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8083" xml_f="8124" txt_i="1861" txt_f="1902">Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN37042683.</offsets></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology</kwd><kwd>Paediatrics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="8303" xml_f="8318" txt_i="1911" txt_f="1926">ARTICLE SUMMARY</offsets></title></caption><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8348" xml_f="8361" txt_i="1927" txt_f="1940">Article focus</offsets></title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="8408" xml_f="8601" txt_i="1941" txt_f="2134">Protocol of a randomised controlled trial designed to examine if an intensive structured education course will influence clinical and psychological outcomes in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.</offsets></p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8642" xml_f="8654" txt_i="2136" txt_f="2148">Key messages</offsets></title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="8701" xml_f="8793" txt_i="2149" txt_f="2241">Self-management education has been shown to improve outcomes in adults with type 1 diabetes.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="8823" xml_f="9011" txt_i="2242" txt_f="2430">Literature review has identified that relatively few well designed trials of educational interventions or psychoeducational interventions have been undertaken in children and young people.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="9041" xml_f="9105" txt_i="2431" txt_f="2495">Follow-up is often of short duration and sample sizes are small.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="9135" xml_f="9251" txt_i="2496" txt_f="2612">Outcomes are variable with few studies demonstrating benefit in terms of both glycaemic control and quality of life.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="9281" xml_f="9490" txt_i="2613" txt_f="2822">The aim of this study is to undertake a multi centre RCT, of adequate power and long duration follow-up, to assess potential benefit of a structured education programme in 11–16 year olds with type 1 diabetes.</offsets></p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9531" xml_f="9570" txt_i="2824" txt_f="2863">Strengths and limitations of this study</offsets></title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="9617" xml_f="9715" txt_i="2864" txt_f="2962">The intervention has been developed with school teachers, aiming to meet UK educational standards.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="9745" xml_f="9834" txt_i="2963" txt_f="3052">Cluster randomised design.

These range from simple skills and knowledge acquisition to more complex interventions involving family and friends. In a systematic review commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme, Hampson and colleagues highlight a lack of well-designed clinical trials of educational interventions in the UK.

Knowledge and skills are built up throughout the week with active participant involvement and problem solving as key methods of learning. The key modules include: what is diabetes?; food and diabetes; insulin management; management of hypoglycaemia; sick day rules; diabetes in school and social situations. Learning objectives for each day and each session are clearly identified, and educators have instructions on session preparation and teaching materials. Lesson plans give guidance on timing, and a student activity section serves to give an idea of expected responses. Each meal and snack is used as an opportunity to practise carbohydrate estimation and insulin dose adjustment. Additional support is provided through dedicated parent sessions, involvement of friends and the provision of a school resource pack. Following process evaluation during the pilot phase, the model of parental education has been altered and parents are now invited to a specific parent education session prior to their children attending the 5-day course.

When ‘permission’ is given to eat a less restricted diet, there is the possibility that participants may make unhealthier food choices, with potential for weight gain. With improving glycaemic control, there is a potential risk of increasing severe hypoglycaemia. Education in avoidance, recognition and management of hypoglycaemia is an essential part of the course. The course aims to provide children with the skills to match their insulin dose to their food choice and regularly correct their blood sugar. The anticipated benefits are therefore improved blood sugar control, QOL and self-efficacy. This, in turn, may lead to less family conflict and better social integration.

Two academic educationalists observe courses, hold focus groups with educators and have informal discussions with participants. They will produce an independent report of the educational content of the KICk-OFF package, identifying areas of effective education and also providing suggestions for change to the curriculum and teaching material. They will also work with the lead research educator to develop quality assurance checklists that can be used to assess consistency of teaching between educator groups and adherence to the learning aims and objectives of the curriculum.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s3n"><title><offsets xml_i="39184" xml_f="39218" txt_i="28390" txt_f="28424">Participant retention/missing data</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39229" xml_f="39564" txt_i="28425" txt_f="28760">Principal investigators in each centre are sent regular updates regarding completeness of data returns from their participants and encouraged to ensure as complete a data set as possible.

Our hypothesis is that behaviour change as a result of attending a KICk-OFF course is likely to take place within 6–12 months of the intervention. We felt that a 2-year follow-up was necessary to assess sustainability of learning but also accept that the adolescent years are a time of great change and many other confounding factors such as puberty, school and peer pressure will influence adherence to a diabetes regimen and long-term outcomes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43277" xml_f="44306" txt_i="32252" txt_f="33281">Sustainability of learning will also be influenced by ongoing support from the local diabetes team. They are asked to run follow-up sessions within 6 months of the intervention and to encourage participants to continue to use their KICk-OFF self-management skills in everyday life. Paediatric diabetes care across the UK is changing rapidly, with many more children using an intensive insulin regimen from diagnosis and also moving onto insulin infusion pumps. Many centres routinely teach carbohydrate counting, though none with an intensive course such as KICk-OFF. Although the KICk-OFF course is not specifically designed for those on pumps, many of the skills required to successfully manage a pump are taught on the course. We anticipate that a number of our original cohort will move onto pumps during the study and will examine this group as a subgroup analysis. Change in educational practice by local centres across the study period will also be examined by repeating the stratification process at the end of the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44313" xml_f="44753" txt_i="33282" txt_f="33719">We aim to reduce inter-educator variability by having just three teams of educators who will all receive specialist teacher training prior to teaching KICk-OFF courses. Practical factors such as weather and illness may impact on attendance at a KICk-OFF course. We shall attempt to provide catch-up education for those who miss days but any participant who is present for &lt;3 days will be deemed to be non compliant with the intervention.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44760" xml_f="45343" txt_i="33720" txt_f="34303">Unlike other interventions, we decided not to use the existing HbA1c level as an inclusion or exclusion criteria. We are therefore recruiting participants with a wide range of glycaemic control. Some will have an HbA1c within the recommended target of less than 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) at baseline and therefore may not change. Those with very tight control at baseline may be suffering from frequent hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemia unawareness. Their glycaemic control could deteriorate somewhat, but we hypothesise that concurrent reduction in hypoglycaemia could result in improved QOL.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45350" xml_f="45918" txt_i="34304" txt_f="34872">Structured education, providing knowledge and skills training to young people with diabetes, is an essential component of self-management. We hope that the KICk-OFF study will add important information to the literature by assessing the impact of intensive group education. We acknowledge, however, that the acquisition of effective self-management skills is highly complex and that many other factors such as family support and functioning, diabetes team interaction with families and other pressures within the lives of young people also influence their development.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="45974" xml_f="45996" txt_i="34874" txt_f="34896">Supplementary Material</offsets></title><supplementary-material id="d34e256" content-type="local-data"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="46083" xml_f="46102" txt_i="34897" txt_f="34916">Author's manuscript</offsets></title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002429.draft_revisions.pdf"></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e257" content-type="local-data"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="46334" xml_f="46351" txt_i="34917" txt_f="34934">Reviewer comments</offsets></title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002429.reviewer_comments.pdf"></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KJP, SH, CE, JK conceived the idea for the study and initial study design.
