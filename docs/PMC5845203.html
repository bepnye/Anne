School-based humanistic counselling (SBHC) may help young people identify, address, and overcome psychological distress. Data from four pilot trials suggest that SBHC may be clinically effective.

Eligibility criteria for young people include being between 13 and 16 years of age and experiencing moderate to severe levels of emotional distress. Participants are randomised to receive either SBHC or PCAU. SBHC is delivered in up to 10 weekly, individual sessions in their school with a qualified, experienced counsellor who has also received training using a clinical practice manual. Adherence to the SBHC model is assessed by a sub-team of auditors and in clinical supervision. PCAU consists of the schools’ pre-existing systems for supporting the emotional health and well-being of students. The primary outcomes are psychological distress measured using the Young Person’s Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (YP-CORE) and costs evaluated using the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI). Secondary outcomes include psychological difficulties, levels of depression, anxiety and self-esteem, well-being, school engagement, educational outcomes and achievement of personal goals. Qualitative interviews with participants, parents and school staff will look to identify the mechanisms of change in SBHC. Researchers administering the measures are blind to allocation.

Prior to any assessments of eligibility, pastoral care staff, briefed and trained on the details of the trial, identify which young people in their school they deem to be potentially eligible using the trial eligibility criteria. Pastoral care staff approach, and invite, potentially eligible young people for a pre-screening meeting to discuss the project, and if the young person expresses an interest in participating in the trial, and is willing to ask their parents/carers for signed consent, the pastoral care teacher sends a standardised trial letter to their parents/carers with information about the trial and consenting procedures. This method of identifying young people who may benefit from counselling reflects a relatively commonplace procedure in pastoral care referral to counselling services in UK schools. At this stage, it is explained to parents/carers that not every young person who is put forward to take part in the trial is eligible, and that assessment procedures are not a judgement about the young person or their problems, but an assessment of trial eligibility. Once parents/carers ‘opt in’ informed consent is obtained pastoral care staff make an initial referral to the ETHOS research team, on the basis of likelihood that the young person they have identified will meet all eligibility criteria during the assessment meeting. Informed parent/carer consent is obtained either in writing, or via the telephone with a member of the pastoral care staff or an ETHOS researcher acting as a proxy to obtain consent in this way.

During this meeting, the assessor makes a judgement as to whether they believe that the young person is of sufficient maturity and understanding to consent to participate in the research study, using Competence to Consent Guidelines developed for the trial. This judgement is made prior to any other assessment of eligibility; and the young person’s written, informed consent is obtained prior to any study procedures being carried out, or outcome measures being administered.

Respondents are required to respond to each of the 25 attributes by reflecting on the last 6 months. For each sub-scale, the score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater difficulties. Young people completing the SDQ at the assessment meeting for the current trial are required to score ≥ 5 on the emotional symptoms sub-scale (SDQ-ES).

If a young person scores ≥ 1 (on YP-CORE item 4) the assessor asks, in a sensitive and gentle manner, whether they feel that they are at risk to themselves or others, and makes a professional judgement using guidelines for assessing and managing risk developed for the trial. It is explained to the young person that, as there is an equal chance of being allocated to PCAU for 6 to 9 months prior to counselling, it is important for the research and pastoral care teams to know whether they need more immediate attention. If the young person is assessed as being in immediate danger or at risk of serious harm, procedures for onward disclosure and referral are followed. Assessors review the remaining criteria for participating in the trial with the young person before confirming their eligibility.

To help ensure the success of the blind, a different tester is employed at 6 weeks/mid-point, 12 weeks/endpoint and 24 weeks/follow-up for each participant. The success of the blind is assessed by asking testers to report whether the participant or member of the pastoral care staff have revealed what group the participant is allocated to, on the predesigned Case Report Form (CRF) developed for the trial.

Service and support costs will be identified by funder, including those supports and services provided and funded by the school. Care will be taken to identify any systematic cost differences between locations (schools) as the local array of services may differ, leading to variations in access and, therefore, use. Cost and outcome data will be compared over time and between the SBHC and PCAU group and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) calculated using the change in primary outcome (YP-CORE). In the event of the SBHC group having both higher costs and generating improved outcomes, the current approach is to estimate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). The net monetary benefit for the outcome measures will be calculated and the proportion of bootstrapped estimates of the group difference favouring SBHC will be plotted with corresponding values of willingness to pay.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title><offsets xml_i="65677" xml_f="65730" txt_i="49368" txt_f="49421">Risk procedures and reporting of adverse events (AEs)</offsets></title><p id="Par111"><offsets xml_i="65753" xml_f="66890" txt_i="49422" txt_f="50559">Written protocols for managing risk, and monitoring and reporting AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) is followed for all trial participants throughout the trial (from the point of enrolment into the trial, to the follow-up/24-week time point). An adverse event (AE) is defined as any negative psychological, emotional or behavioural occurrence, or sustained deterioration in a research participant. In the current trial, we have included arrest by police; running away from home; excluded from family home; school exclusion; significant decrease in school attendance; significant deterioration in behaviour, including threatening violence, exhibiting violent behaviour or serious injury to another person, exposure to violence or abuse; significant increase in emotional difficulties; self-harm (if not a presenting issue), or escalating self-harm (when it is a presenting issue); a complaint made against the counsellor, or an issue with the counsellor, resulting in discontinuation of counselling; suicidal ideation; suicidal intent; hospitalisation due to drugs or alcohol, or for psychiatric reasons; and death, including suicide.</offsets></p><p id="Par112"><offsets xml_i="66909" xml_f="67939" txt_i="50560" txt_f="51590">An Adverse Events Reporting Form is used by all individuals in contact with participants, who are trained to recognise and respond, in an ethical and timely way, to risk and any issues relating to safeguarding. The overall safety of participants is the responsibility of the trial’s chief investigator (CI). However, in practice the CI relies on all research staff, counsellors, supervisors and school staff to ensure that AEs are identified and addressed in an appropriate and timely manner. Thus, safety is a shared responsibility. Individuals completing the form are asked to consider whether the AE is serious, defined as any AE which is life threatening or results in death, and whether it may be a result of participating in the trial. The severity of each AE is also assessed, according to its intensity, duration and the degree of impairment to the young person (or, when relevant, another person such as in case of risk to others). Severity is graded as ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, ‘severe’, ‘very severe’, or ‘extremely severe’.</offsets></p><p id="Par113"><offsets xml_i="67958" xml_f="68388" txt_i="51591" txt_f="52021">The CI has responsibility for reviewing and signing the AE Reporting Forms, for ensuring that the relevant school staff member is aware of the occurrence of any AEs or SAEs at their school; and the ETHOS clinical lead (CL) in instances where the AE or SAE has occurred in a participant in the SBHC group.

The aim is to ensure that the trial explores issues of relevance to young people, and minimises participant attrition. Representatives from both panels have been invited to join the Trial Steering Committee (see below). Panel members include young people who have received training from the NCB Research Centre in a range of research skills (e.g. appraising the academic literature, reviewing engagement materials, co-producing research summaries).

Evidence of the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions with children and adolescents comes mainly from trials of CBT for the treatment of anxiety and depression. As many young people referred to school counselling services are more likely to be experiencing emotional distress as a result of a range of life difficulties, rather than a specific clinical disorder, there is a need for school-based interventions that address these needs. SBHC presents one such potential intervention, and the results from four pilot trials provide preliminary evidence of clinical effectiveness. Determining the clinical and cost-effectiveness of SBHC is important for all stakeholders, including policy-makers, statutory advisory bodies for child welfare, head teachers, children and young people practitioners, child welfare and parenting organisations, and young people.</offsets></p><p id="Par119"><offsets xml_i="73209" xml_f="73968" txt_i="56584" txt_f="57343">Conducting the current trial in a school (real-world) setting is a pragmatic approach to assessing the effectiveness of SBHC compared to PCAU, with the added advantage of being able to evaluate the intervention in a way that mirrors routine practice. School pastoral care staff are particularly well placed to identify potentially eligible participants, and so working with schools during the pre-screening period may also be beneficial to the trial’s recruitment rates. A further advantage of conducting the current trial in a school setting pertains to school culture and day-to-day structures (e.g. the use of regular timetables, monitoring of pupil attendance), which lends itself well to scheduling and completing data collection at our four time points.</offsets></p><p id="Par120"><offsets xml_i="73987" xml_f="75473" txt_i="57344" txt_f="58830">There are also significant challenges to conducting the current trial within a school context. Necessary protocols for ethical research practice can present a burden to included schools, which are not familiar with the research-related administration involved in running a trial of this size. Equally, the trial’s schedule of time points for data collection and counselling sessions needs to take into account the various academic calendars across schools, including such things as school holidays, site inspections carried out by the Office for Standards in Education, and in-service, school training days for staff. These particular challenges have necessitated training provision and regular debriefing in the research aspects of the trial, with schools; and the nature and realities of school life to our researchers, as well as developing and maintaining strong working relationship between sub-teams. A final challenge of conducting ETHOS in a school environment pertains to the heterogeneous nature of our schools’ pastoral care provision, which may present particular challenges at the point of analysis. We aim to address this challenge through collecting data on each school’s pastoral care provision in the School Characteristic’s Form developed for the study, and by collecting information relevant to each participant’s engagement with their school’s pastoral care services regarding type, regularity and length of time, in a Pastoral Care Log also developed for the study.</offsets></p><p id="Par121"><offsets xml_i="75492" xml_f="76263" txt_i="58831" txt_f="59602">In addition, a considerable challenge has included developing a protocol for monitoring and reporting AEs in counselling. The academic literature regarding AE monitoring in RCTs generally relates to trials of pharmacological interventions and there is scant academic literature in the counselling and psychotherapy fields. This has require us to utilise a process of adopting and adapting a model of monitoring and reporting more commonly applied in pharmacological studies, as well as drawing on the clinical expertise within the core research team to inform protocol development. We view our current approach as iterative, and aim towards being able to share an established, more definitive, set of protocols with the counselling research community on trial completion.</offsets></p><p id="Par122"><offsets xml_i="76282" xml_f="77465" txt_i="59603" txt_f="60786">A further challenge includes obtaining parent/carer consent prior to the assessment meeting with the young person. While our method of ‘opt-in’ consent was ethically necessary, it can be time consuming to obtain and has presented school staff with additional administrative duties. This has been largely overcome by working closely with school staff as early as possible in the process of identifying young people for the project and engaging their parent/carer. However, this method may also be contributing to the variable recruitment rates we have observed across included schools, as it has required parents and carers to be sufficiently engaged with their child’s school, as well as being able to read English at a sufficient level to understand the Information Sheet for Parents/Carers. Parent/carer ‘opt-in’ consent represents a potential source of selection bias, as we are only including participants who have been willing to involve their parent/carer in their decision to take part in the trial and whose parent/carer has agreed to their involvement; and in terms of only including participants and parents/carers with a sufficient level of English language comprehension.</offsets></p><p id="Par123"><offsets xml_i="77484" xml_f="78169" txt_i="60787" txt_f="61472">The results of this trial will contribute significantly to the evidence base for SBHC and to the wider field of adolescent mental health interventions. Our data also has the potential to inform the development of national guidelines for mental health support for schools and make a direct contribution at a policy level, by providing up-to-date and reliable information about the utility of school counselling.
