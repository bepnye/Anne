This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial (N=301 smokers) tested 200 and 400 µg doses administered 4 or 5 times over 6 months compared to placebo. 3’AmNic-rEPA recipients with the highest serum anti-nicotine antibody response (top 30% by AUC) were significantly more likely to attain 8 weeks continuous abstinence from weeks 19 through 26 than the placebo recipients (24.6% vs. 12.0%, p=0.024, OR=2.69, 95% CI, 1.14–6.37). The 5 injection 400 µg dose regimen had the greatest antibody response and had significantly higher abstinence rates than placebo.

Conceptually, the mechanism of action is that anti-nicotine antibodies bind nicotine molecules and the resulting complex is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier. With increasing Ab levels more nicotine is captured and sequestered in the blood and prevented from entering the brain, leading to less reinforcing effects from nicotine. Animal studies have demonstrated that passive or active immunization results in approximately 30% to 90% less nicotine entering the brain compared to control rats [</offsets><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8645" xml_f="8646" txt_i="2537" txt_f="2538">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8653" xml_f="8654" txt_i="2538" txt_f="2539">–</offsets><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8685" xml_f="8686" txt_i="2539" txt_f="2540">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8693" xml_f="8721" txt_i="2540" txt_f="2568">] and attenuated locomotor [</offsets><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8752" xml_f="8753" txt_i="2568" txt_f="2569">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8760" xml_f="8762" txt_i="2569" txt_f="2571">, </offsets><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8793" xml_f="8794" txt_i="2571" txt_f="2572">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8801" xml_f="8819" txt_i="2572" txt_f="2590">] and behavioral [</offsets><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8850" xml_f="8851" txt_i="2590" txt_f="2591">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8858" xml_f="8860" txt_i="2591" txt_f="2593">, </offsets><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8891" xml_f="8892" txt_i="2593" txt_f="2594">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8899" xml_f="9014" txt_i="2594" txt_f="2709">] responses to nicotine.

Importantly, this dose and schedule demonstrated statistically significant improved 44-week CAR compared to placebo. Because the 4 injection/400 µg dose was not associated with higher abstinence rates, this result demonstrates that consideration of both dose and schedule of injection are critical. In an independent, follow-up immunogenicity study to examine if peak Ab levels could be elevated, a total of 74 subjects received 6 injections of 400 µg 3’AmNic-rEPA at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 26.
