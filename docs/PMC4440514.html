For this investigation, a RASS score of −3, (movement or eye opening in response to voice but no eye contact) regardless of whether disease or sedative induced, is handled as part of the spectrum of coma. While the validation studies for the CAM-ICU have demonstrated that delirium can be diagnosed in patients with a RASS score of −3 at Watford, along with some other centres, we routinely classify a patient with such as score as unable to be assessed (usually due to sedation). We decided this because of the clinical relevance of a RASS score of −3 as shown by the Sedation Practice in Intensive Care Evaluation (SPICE) Study Investigators and ANZICS Clinical Trials Group who have demonstrated that early deep sedation, defined as RASS score −3 to −5, predicts delayed extubation and increased mortality [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17"><offsets xml_i="18907" xml_f="18909" txt_i="10572" txt_f="10574">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18916" xml_f="18918" txt_i="10574" txt_f="10576">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18925" xml_f="19450" txt_i="10577" txt_f="11102">Other secondary outcomes are the number of ventilator-free days at 28 days, mortality at six months, organ failure-free days, cognitive decline and healthcare resource use.
