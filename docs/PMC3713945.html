One strategy that may increase physical activity duration is exercising with an Internet partner (ie, someone who is virtually present, as in video chat). Internet partners help people overcome many barriers associated with face-to-face exercise groups (eg, time, coordinating schedules, social physique anxiety). Past research examining individual performance in groups suggests that an increase in effort occurs when performing a task conjunctively, ie, when a participant is (1) less capable than fellow group members, and (2) participants efforts are particularly indispensable for group success (ie, where the group’s potential productivity is equal to the productivity of its least capable member). This boost in effort is more commonly known as the Köhler effect, named after the German psychologist who first observed the effect. While encouragement between group members is common practice in face-to-face group exercise, the effect of encouragement between partners exercising conjunctively across the Internet is unknown.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title><offsets xml_i="6377" xml_f="6386" txt_i="1242" txt_f="1251">Objective</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6397" xml_f="6666" txt_i="1252" txt_f="1521">To examine the impact of exercising alone, compared to exercising conjunctively with an Internet partner, both with and without encouragement, on exercise persistence (primary outcomes) and secondary psychosocial outcomes (self-efficacy, enjoyment, exercise intention).</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="6707" xml_f="6714" txt_i="1523" txt_f="1530">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6725" xml_f="7404" txt_i="1531" txt_f="2210">Participants were recruited online and face-to-face from the campus of Michigan State University.

For both partner conditions, it was further explained that they were working towards a team score, where the team score would be the persistence score of the first teammate to quit an exercise (ie, as soon as either partner quit, the exercise was over).

The images available to the participant suggested that s/he was always the first to quit each exercise. The video link was allegedly frozen as soon as either teammate quit an exercise and until just before the start of the next exercise; hence, the participant knew only that his/her partner had been able to persist longer, but not just how much longer. In the encouragement condition, a prerecorded series of phrases of encouragement was played through a set of computer speakers controlled by the experimenter.

First, a boost in self-efficacy could lead to increases in effort, as has been shown in a number of performance-based studies [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29"><offsets xml_i="38236" xml_f="38238" txt_i="29198" txt_f="29200">29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38245" xml_f="38246" txt_i="29200" txt_f="29201">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30"><offsets xml_i="38280" xml_f="38282" txt_i="29201" txt_f="29203">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38289" xml_f="38675" txt_i="29203" txt_f="29589">]. However, we found no boost in self-efficacy in either partner condition. Conversely, we reasoned that efficacy-boosting feedback could also undermine effort, either by being so inconsistent with actual relative performance that one gives up or by leading to an overly confident belief in one’s capabilities and thereby undermining the desire to compare favorably with one’s partner [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31"><offsets xml_i="38709" xml_f="38711" txt_i="29589" txt_f="29591">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38718" xml_f="39350" txt_i="29591" txt_f="30223">]. Indeed, we observed significant differences in effort between the two partner conditions. However, no such increases in self-efficacy or perceived ability were found between the two partner conditions. Thus, changes in self-efficacy/perceived ability did not likely account for the attenuation of the duration-boosting effect in the encouragement condition. That encouragement did not have an effect on one’s self-efficacy does not come as a surprise, as feedback regarding one’s own performance (ie, mastery experiences) is typically more influential than verbal encouragement in affecting one’s judgments of his/her abilities [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28"><offsets xml_i="39384" xml_f="39386" txt_i="30223" txt_f="30225">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39393" xml_f="39714" txt_i="30225" txt_f="30546">].

Unfortunately, in the current study, we did not take any explicit measures of the subjects’ interpretations of the partner’s statements. However, subjects who received encouragement enjoyed the task equally as much as those who did not receive encouragement.

This could be expected especially if the intended target of the partner’s message was somewhat ambiguous, as could be the case in the current study (eg, “You can do it”; where “you” could be taken to be directed at the partner or one’s self). Interpreting the message as self-encouragement might suggest to the participants that the supposedly superior partner was in fact struggling with the task, thereby creating doubt in the degree of the partner’s superiority.

In the present study, despite all the performance feedback suggesting that their partner was superior in ability, by the end of the experiment, those in the encouragement condition perceived themselves as comparable to their partner in ability.

In this study, we do so and identify with whom (a moderately superior partner) and under what conditions (when one is the “weak link”; exercising with an Internet partner; no encouragement) exercising in groups can boost one’s effort and ultimately the duration of exercise. Second, as more physical activity promotion strategies are moving to digital modes of delivery, this study contributes to a body of basic research that provides fertile ground on which to base algorithms for electronically mediated, group-based physical activity interventions (eg, customized computer-generated partners, match-making applications). The current study suggests that when communication is part of such a partner- or group-based intervention, designers should facilitate clear and unambiguous communication between partners (eg, constrain communication to have the desired effort-boosting effect, perhaps by forcing partners to select from a fixed set of text messages).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43252" xml_f="44267" txt_i="33920" txt_f="34935">Of course, this study has its limitations. The study was conducted in a highly controlled laboratory setting, and it may be premature to suggest that these findings generalize to free-living conditions and other populations who are more physically inactive. Second, subjects were recruited through both face-to-face and web-based systems, and because we did not code participants for how they were recruited, we were unable to control for any individual differences between recruitment strategy (eg, being recruited via Internet may have selected for people who are more motivated to work out alone). Third, although we found that being the weak link can motivate participants to exercise longer, it is not clear if the same strategy could have the same positive impact on other dimensions of physical activity behavior (eg, frequency and intensity of exercise). Last, we tested participants in only one session of exercise, and repeatedly being the “weak link” over several sessions may actually be de-motivating [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34"><offsets xml_i="44301" xml_f="44303" txt_i="34935" txt_f="34937">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44310" xml_f="44600" txt_i="34937" txt_f="35227">].
