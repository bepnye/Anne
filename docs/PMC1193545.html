We conducted this randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of BNHS with other commonly prescribed drugs. We recruited 120 patients from two teaching hospitals; 30 patients in each hospital were randomly assigned to receive BNHS. In one hospital, the 30 controls were given another traditional Chinese drug; whereas a Western medicine (chondroprotection drug/Viartril-s) was used as the control in the other hospital. Intervention was carried out over a period of 4 weeks. Primary outcome measures included self-reported pain level, and changes in stiffness and functional ability as measured by the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index. Mixed models were used for statistical analysis. Substantial improvements in disease-specific symptoms were observed, after 4 weeks of treatment, in patients taking BNHS capsules. As assessed by the WOMAC index, pain level of the BNHS group decreased by 57% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 50, 63], stiffness by 63% (95% CI = 55, 71) and functional ability increased by 56% (95% CI = 50, 63). No significant differences were found in any of the outcome measures between the BNHS group and either of the comparison groups. No severe adverse effects were reported. However, this study lacked a placebo group; therefore, we conclude that BNHS appears to be as effective as commonly prescribed medicines for the relief of pain and dysfunction in knee osteoarthritis patients, but costs a lot less than other Western and herbal drugs in the study.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chinese herbal medicine</kwd><kwd>chondroprotection drug</kwd><kwd>WOMAC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5862" xml_f="5874" txt_i="1687" txt_f="1699">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5885" xml_f="6097" txt_i="1700" txt_f="1912">Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease.

Treatment modalities for knee OA include non-pharmacologic (e.g. physical and occupational therapy, aerobic exercise programs, weight control and patient education) and pharmacologic therapy [e.g. intra-articular steroid injections, paracetamol, topical analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioid analgesics] (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2"><offsets xml_i="6507" xml_f="6508" txt_i="2253" txt_f="2254">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6515" xml_f="6759" txt_i="2254" txt_f="2498">). Although NSAIDs are the most widely prescribed drugs to reduce joint pain and stiffness, the inflammatory component of OA is usually minimal; therefore, the need for the anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs in this condition is controversial (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3"><offsets xml_i="6790" xml_f="6791" txt_i="2498" txt_f="2499">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6798" xml_f="7091" txt_i="2499" txt_f="2792">). Since the efficacy of NSAIDs in symptomatic treatment of OA of the knee depends on analgesic rather than anti-inflammatory effect, paracetamol has been recently recommended as the first-line oral drug. On the one hand, long-term use of paracetamol can lead to hepatic and renal impairment (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4"><offsets xml_i="7122" xml_f="7123" txt_i="2792" txt_f="2793">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7130" xml_f="7380" txt_i="2793" txt_f="3043">).

These disadvantages call for an evaluation of the risks and benefits of the therapies in comparison with a less toxic one for OA. Thus, less toxic pain managing procedures, e.g. electroacupuncture or acupuncture as reported, as well as chondroprotection drugs are considered alternative treatments and they are widely prescribed in China.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7807" xml_f="7974" txt_i="3388" txt_f="3555">Evidence gathered from a systematic review show that herbal medicines, which appear relatively safe, may offer a much-needed alternative, and merit further attention (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7"><offsets xml_i="8005" xml_f="8006" txt_i="3555" txt_f="3556">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8013" xml_f="9092" txt_i="3556" txt_f="4635">). The blood-nourishing and hard-softening capsule (BNHS), which is an extract from Bai Shao (radix paeoniae alba), Qin Jiao (radix gentianae macrophyllae) and Gan Cao (radix glycyrrhizae), containing mainly paconiflorin and gentianine, is a traditional Chinese herb used for symptomatic treatment of inflammation and pain in OA. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), OA is known as the Bi syndrome (painful obstruction), which means either the limbs or the joints are suffered from pain and malfunction, and herb therapy has long been a standard treatment. Only limited data are available on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of traditional Chinese herbs in the treatment of OA of the knee. Therefore, we initiated this study to compare the efficacy of BNHS, another commonly prescribed Chinese herb counter osteophytes capsule, and Western medicine Viartril-s (chondroprotection drug) in short-term symptomatic treatment of OA of the knee. We hypothesized that BNHS is as effective as, but will cost less than, other commonly prescribed drugs chosen for comparison purposes.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><offsets xml_i="9143" xml_f="9164" txt_i="4637" txt_f="4658">Materials and Methods</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9184" xml_f="9196" txt_i="4659" txt_f="4671">Study Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9207" xml_f="9578" txt_i="4672" txt_f="5043">This was a prospective two-center randomized controlled trial.

These included inadequate sessions of treatment, failure to control concomitant therapies and no sham, placebo or controlled group.

In this study, the BNHS was generally safe and well tolerated. After 4 weeks of treatment, 61% still preferred to stay on BNHS. Compared with NSAIDs, the anti-pain mechanism of BNHS is still unclear. The specific way NSAIDs develop effect is through the inhibition of COX. Meanwhile, the most common renal effects of conventional NSAIDs attributable to the inhibition of COX are a reduction in both glomerular filtration rate and excretion of sodium, with the attendant potential for fluid retention and edema (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19"><offsets xml_i="22860" xml_f="22862" txt_i="17208" txt_f="17210">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22869" xml_f="23245" txt_i="17210" txt_f="17586">). Viartril-s mainly consists of chondroitin sulfate, which is a chondroprotection agent and a key component of the extracellular matrix of cartilage.

However, the exact mechanism requires further investigations.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23726" xml_f="24350" txt_i="17966" txt_f="18590">The major limitation of the present study was the lack of a placebo group. We cannot rule out the possibility that patients got better despite any treatments they received, especially symptoms in OA often improve with no treatment and undergo a fluctuating course. The lack of any significant differences across the three treatments might well be explained by this. However, as the two comparison drugs were commonly prescribed in the two participating hospitals, including a control arm with, say, paracetamol but without the chosen control drugs would be extremely difficult for the researchers to obtain ethical approval.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24357" xml_f="24934" txt_i="18591" txt_f="19168">The finding that BNHS is as effective as both controlled drugs is itself very encouraging, as it implies that the cost-effectiveness of BNHS could be substantially higher. This is due to the fact BNHS is 88% less expensive than the Western drug Viartril-s. Although BNHS is only marginally cheaper than the other Chinese herbal medicine, the dosage required to achieve similar effects is lower (88.2 versus 147 g per case), hence the total cost is substantially lower. It must also be mentioned that compared with boiled herbal formula, capsules are more likely to be accepted.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24941" xml_f="25162" txt_i="19169" txt_f="19390">One limitation of this study was that sample size was not very large.

Yet, any conclusive remarks on equivalence can only be made after a proper bioequivalence study with a much larger sample is conducted. Another limitation was the lack of long-term follow-up and evaluation. However, the duration chosen in the present study was in line with acute OA flare episodes, and the study was long enough to document BNHS's rapid onset of action and its sustained efficacy over 4 weeks. Although WOMAC is an internationally recognized measurement method, it has never been used as an outcome measure in clinical trials of Chinese herbs; but we do not see why it could have caused any concerns. Given the differences between Chinese herbs and Western medicine, it was difficult to employ a double-blind design in Hospital B.
