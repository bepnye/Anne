Student self-reports of having spent more than 2 h/week on independent ECG self-study and of having used additional ECG learning material during the module were used as secondary outcomes. Multivariate regression analyses adusting for sex, age, performance levels, and initial self-ratings were used to predict primary and secondary outcomes. Formative examinations and the lowest level of teaching intensity (self-directed learning) were used as reference for these analyses, and results are given as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The interaction between teaching intensity and assessment consequences was tested by adding interaction terms to the models. To validate the primary measure of student performance, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we used an ANOVA to examine the effects of teaching format and assessment consequences on the percentage score in the ECG exit exam.

The most important consequence of this finding for medical education is that medical educators must be aware of the huge influence of assessments on student learning behavior. Examinations should therefore be designed with great care. Recognizing summative examinations as the main driving force of student learning also demands the prioritization of learning objectives, as the capacity for testing during medical education is limited. Medical schools should strive to agree upon a set of learning objectives that are considered crucial for every physician. Concentrating resources on the design and implementation of valid summative examinations may prove more cost effective in the long run than trying to identify the optimal teaching method for each learning objective.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44438" xml_f="44451" txt_i="33114" txt_f="33127">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44462" xml_f="44542" txt_i="33128" txt_f="33208">ANOVA: analysis of variance; CI: confidence interval; ECG: electrocardiogram; OR</offsets><italic><sub><offsets xml_i="44555" xml_f="44559" txt_i="33208" txt_f="33212">int </offsets></sub></italic><offsets xml_i="44574" xml_f="44651" txt_i="33212" txt_f="33289">: odds ratio for interaction; PT: peer teaching; SDL: self-directed learning.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44673" xml_f="44692" txt_i="33291" txt_f="33310">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44703" xml_f="44761" txt_i="33311" txt_f="33369">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44783" xml_f="44805" txt_i="33371" txt_f="33393">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44816" xml_f="45437" txt_i="33394" txt_f="34015">TR conceived of the study, developed its design, was involved in data analysis and wrote the manuscript.
