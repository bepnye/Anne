Preoperative anxiety is inevitable though it may be variable in different patients. Even a newborn is not free from anxiety. Anxiety is common preoperatively and to reduce it different pharmacological interventions are done including the use of narcotics, hypnotics, sedatives, and anxiolytics, etc., which are not usually free from their side effects. Sometimes, patients use these drugs postoperatively and they become habit forming or lead to other cognitive dysfunctions. Anesthesiologists have variable perception of patient's anxiety. Anesthesia is one of the causes of anxiety; other causes are surgical technique, success of operation, fear of anticipated complications, and amount of information provided to patients. Fear of death is a major anxiety factor in patients undergoing surgery. Most of the patients are unaware of what is happening in the operating room. No doubt that the Internet has brought revolutionary changes in our personal life, but ours being a developing country, still population living in far flung areas do not have any access to multimedia to become aware about surgical and anesthesia procedures. Even it will be true to say that large population of our country does not know anything about anesthesia and they still have misconceptions about anesthesia that anesthesia is what they are given to smell or forced to smell and an injection given on the back for certain surgical procedures. And fear of reversal from anesthesia remains one of the major anxiety factors in their minds. This research topic of our discussion deals with studying the anxiety levels of patients coming for different types of surgeries and Anesthesiologists addressing patient's concerns preoperatively improves patient's confidence. This research paper is a sort of study carried out to uncover the most anxiety provoking aspects of surgery and anesthesia and to determine what interventions may help alleviate such anxiety. In this study, we investigated anxiety level arising from the experience of the clinical environment during surgery and anesthesia and second to cover the specific aspects, which patient's find anxiety provoking and dissuade them from opting anesthesia.</offsets></p><sec id="sec2-1"><title><offsets xml_i="7898" xml_f="7918" txt_i="4176" txt_f="4196">Review of literature</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7929" xml_f="8383" txt_i="4197" txt_f="4651">Anesthesia has proved to be highly anxiety provoking.

Keeping this in mind, if we show to patients undergoing anesthesia and surgery, a little bit about what is happening in intraoperative period and how patients come out of anesthesia, especially about cool and calm outcome in the postoperative area, we may build certain level of patient's confidence. Similarly, anxiety related to pain, death, torture, and other misfortunate happenings can be reduced by showing videos/images before undergoing any procedure.

Indeed, a confident professional and friendly relationship with the patient reduces anxiety.

Main reasons of anxiety in the patients were due to the anticipated anesthetic complications, surgical techniques, success of operation, fear of being unconscious, pain and weakness in any part of body postoperatively as well as death related to anesthesia or surgery. At the moment, most commonly employed procedures to allay patient's anxiety were to give anxiolytics. However, after this study, we came to the conclusion that if the patient is well-versed with all anesthetic and surgical procedures particularly by showing him or her videos/images and reassuring him/her yielded good result, with the result that there was statistical difference of level of anxiety between two groups. In Group II, 88% of patients received anxiolytics to allay anxiety as compared to only 10% cases in Group I. Group I has mild to moderate anxiety after showing videos/images and 1 h before surgery and only mild anxiety after surgery while in Group II, where videos/images were not shown, patients suffered moderate to severe anxiety all the time.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19862" xml_f="20139" txt_i="14090" txt_f="14367">From the discussion, we, therefore, conclude that after showing videos/images
