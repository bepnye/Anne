Previous research shows that successful weight loss may be associated with the amount of investment the patient feels that they have made in their operation. For example, those who feel that it has taken more time and effort to organise, has cost more money, has been more disruptive to their lives and has caused pain are more likely to lose weight after their operation. Therefore, it seems as if the greater the sense of investment, the greater the motivation to make the operation a success. The present study aims to build on these findings by encouraging weight loss surgery patients to focus on the investment they have made, thus making their investment more salient to them and a means to improve weight loss outcomes.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4300" xml_f="4307" txt_i="922" txt_f="929">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4318" xml_f="5172" txt_i="930" txt_f="1784">The study involves an open randomised parallel group control trial with patients allocated either to the control or investment intervention group.

In response to growing evidence that WLS does not work for everyone research has attempted to understand this variability. In particular, research has explored the mechanisms involved in successful and failed bariatric surgery to highlight how effectiveness could be improved [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11"><offsets xml_i="8444" xml_f="8446" txt_i="4030" txt_f="4032">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8453" xml_f="8454" txt_i="4032" txt_f="4033">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12"><offsets xml_i="8487" xml_f="8489" txt_i="4033" txt_f="4035">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8496" xml_f="9798" txt_i="4035" txt_f="5337">]. The results indicate that less successful surgery is associated with feeling unprepared for the changes required after surgery, reporting being unsupported in the time following surgery and a sense that although surgery fixes their body, psychological issues relating to dietary control, self-esteem, coping and emotional eating remain neglected. These studies also explored successful weight loss following surgery and reported a role for a reduction in hunger, a decrease in the preoccupation with food and sense of improved control. Such research also highlights a central role for investment and this is supported by other studies using medical and behavioural interventions. For example, bariatric patients reported that success was associated with a feeling that they had made an investment in their operation in terms of factors such as time of work, financial cost, disruption to family and social life, the pain of the surgery and the process of recovery. As one participant said after surgery ‘the amount of pain, the operations performed. Don’t want to do any damage, don’t particularly want the stomach to enlarge anymore which it can do’. Similarly, research indicates that obesity medication may work through the greater investment needed for adherence due to unpleasant side effects [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13"><offsets xml_i="9831" xml_f="9833" txt_i="5337" txt_f="5339">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9840" xml_f="10292" txt_i="5339" txt_f="5791">]. Further, success from behavioural interventions is associated with perceptions of greater investment in attempts to lose weight such as joining self-help groups or attending organised slimming clubs. From this perspective greater investment into weight loss attempts increases the chances of success by motivating the individual to make the most of the efforts they have made so far and encourages them to maximise the consequences of these efforts.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10299" xml_f="10593" txt_i="5792" txt_f="6086">Perceived investment therefore motivates change across all areas of obesity management.

Patients (n = 98) were recruited from an online support group for bariatric patients and were randomly allocated to either the control or intervention group. Those in the intervention group then completed a simple series of carefully framed questions designed to encourage them to consider the investment they had already made in having their operation. For example, they were asked to rate the procedure in terms of their pain experienced, the time spent organising the operation, the disruption to their family and social life, the time needed to recover and the impact of the recovery process on their family and work. This approach was inspired by recent research exploring the ‘mere measurement’ effect which illustrates that simply completing framed questions can change the ways in which people think and behave [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17"><offsets xml_i="12043" xml_f="12045" txt_i="7383" txt_f="7385">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12052" xml_f="12053" txt_i="7385" txt_f="7386">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18"><offsets xml_i="12086" xml_f="12088" txt_i="7386" txt_f="7388">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12095" xml_f="13368" txt_i="7388" txt_f="8661">]. The results from this pilot study indicated that the investment intervention resulted in an immediate change in participants’ beliefs about food and their intentions to change their diet and exercise behaviour. By three months follow up the investment group reported losing 7 kg more than the control group (a significant difference). This pilot study was small scale and involved patients post-surgery only. In addition, follow up data was only collected in the short term and attrition was high by this time point (probably due to the online nature of the study). The present study aims to develop this investment based intervention using a larger sample, with a longer follow up and involving assessments at both pre and post-surgery in order to generate a proper baseline. Bariatric surgery is therefore the treatment of choice for obese patients. Not all patients, however, lose the desired amount of weight. Research highlights a role for investment which lends itself to a low cost, easy to administer intervention that may promote successful weight loss in the longer term. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of an investment based intervention compared to usual care on patient weight loss, beliefs and behaviours after bariatric surgery.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title><offsets xml_i="13400" xml_f="13414" txt_i="8663" txt_f="8677">Methods/Design</offsets></title><sec id="Sec3"><title><offsets xml_i="13444" xml_f="13450" txt_i="8678" txt_f="8684">Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="13461" xml_f="14433" txt_i="8685" txt_f="9657">The study will involve an open randomised parallel group control trial with patients allocated either to the control or investment intervention group.

If effective, obesity surgery improves a patient’s health and reduces their need for NHS care. If unsuccessful then the costs include not only subsequent NHS costs due to these other illnesses but also the costs of the unsuccessful operation and the emotional cost to the patient. The investment based intervention aims to help improve the effectiveness of surgery which in the longer term is likely to be cost effective. This research is based upon a small scale pilot study that showed that a simple investment based intervention which encouraged patients to consider their personal investment in having weight loss surgery, improved weight loss and if this is reproduced in the current larger scale study then such a simple, easy to administer and low cost intervention could become routine practice for bariatric patients.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>WLS</term><def><p>Weight loss surgery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EWL</term><def><p>Excess weight loss</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCH</term><def><p>University College Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCG</term><def><p>Clinical Commissioning Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p>United Kingdom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors’ contributions</bold></p><p>AH, JO and MH designed the study.
