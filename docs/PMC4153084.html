The effects of a novel mTOT modulating insulin sensitizer (MSDC-0160) were explored in non-diabetic patients with mild AD to determine whether treatment would impact glucose metabolism measured by FDG-PET in regions that decline in AD. MSDC-0160 (150 mg once daily; N=16) compared to placebo (N=13) for 12 weeks did not result in a significant difference in glucose metabolism in pre-defined regions when referenced to the pons or whole brain. However, glucose metabolism referenced to cerebellum was maintained in MSDC-0160 treated participants while it significantly declined for placebo patients in anterior and posterior cingulate, and parietal, lateral temporal, medial temporal cortices. Voxel-based analyses showed additional differences in FDG-PET related to MSDC-0160 treatment. These exploratory results suggest central effects of MSDC-0160 and provide a basis for further investigation of mTOT modulating insulin sensitizers in AD patients. </offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alzheimer’s disease</kwd><kwd>FDG-PET</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>insulin sensitizer</kwd><kwd>mTOT modulator.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title><offsets xml_i="5551" xml_f="5563" txt_i="1089" txt_f="1101">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5574" xml_f="5683" txt_i="1102" txt_f="1211">It is estimated that 5.2 million persons in the United States have dementia due to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) [</offsets><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="5714" xml_f="5715" txt_i="1211" txt_f="1212">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5722" xml_f="6220" txt_i="1212" txt_f="1710">].

It is important to note that all evaluations were made after 12 week of treatment and at trough levels of the drug.

Thus, contributions to FDG-PET could result from changes in function in addition to changes in the number of functional cells. It also is important to note that if brain cells involved in cognitive function utilize fuel more efficiently, the ancillary regions in the thalamus or cerebellum that can support memory would be less taxed and their glucose uptake might be lowered.

Ongoing rodent studies demonstrate that MSDC-0160 and is principle metabolite enter brain mitochondria after oral dosing and impact the nutrient sensing pathways in the brain. The limitations of this study include the small sample size and heterogeneity of the subjects inherent in an AD population which may have reduced the ability to detect results of significance, the relative nature of the regional cerebral glucose metabolism measurements, and the short term of treatment necessitated by the early stage in the development of this compound. Recruitment of study subjects that met study criteria also was challenging as many older persons with dementia due to AD also have diabetes mellitus and/or pre-diabetes. Studying an insulin sensitizer for broad application in persons with mild AD may require studies that include recruitment of persons with and without diabetes, examining whether the presence of diabetes modifies the association of treatment with brain glucose metabolism and/or cognition. While the Apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype is known to impact the effectiveness of some AD therapeutics [</offsets><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="40925" xml_f="40927" txt_i="33362" txt_f="33364">36</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40934" xml_f="42173" txt_i="33364" txt_f="34603">], there was no obvious difference in the response to MSDC-0160 in carriers and non-carriers in this study. However, given the size of this study and the fact that it was not of long enough duration to determine the effects on cognition, the impact of this genetic risk factor on the effectiveness of this agent will need to be formally addressed in future trials. Strengths of the study included no loss to follow-up, whereby all subjects who were randomized completed baseline and 12 week PET-imaging, and did so with high compliance to study drug. In addition, a peripheral biologic effect was noted on adiponectin levels which suggests both an anti-inflammatory action as well as improved insulin sensitivity. Finally, the safety profile in older persons with AD showed no difference in the report of adverse events by treatment group. The hemodilution effect of treatment with MSDC-0160 stabilized after four weeks of treatment yet should continue to be monitored in future clinical studies. These preliminary imaging, tolerance, and biologic results provide a basis for further investigation of mTOT modulating insulin sensitizers to alter the brain glucose metabolism and to potentially impact the pathology associated with mild AD.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title><offsets xml_i="42217" xml_f="42227" txt_i="34605" txt_f="34615">CONCLUSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42238" xml_f="42746" txt_i="34616" txt_f="35124">This new class insulin sensitizer is well tolerated in patients with AD, has effects on the biomarker adiponectin as seen previously in diabetic patients, and alters the pattern of FDG-PET uptake in the brain suggesting that this treatment might have central effects on brain metabolic function. Longer term testing of compounds with this mechanism on brain metabolism and cognition is warranted to further define the pharmacological effects and to determine if this approach has disease modifying potential.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This research was conducted by Metabolic Solutions Development Company through a grant from the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (New York, NY, USA).
