The participants of this study comprised older people with hypertension who visited the healthcare centers in Isfahan City. Two healthcare centers located in Isfahan City were sampled for 2 months (July–August 2014). For choosing the samples, initially, we selected two healthcare centers among all centers in Isfahan, which were very alike and similar in terms of cultural, economic, and social consideration. Thus, samples (either control or test) of this study were selected from two centers. Then, the sampling procedure started in these centers through simple sampling technique.

Their conscious written consent was taken as another criterion for inclusion in the study. When the samples were determined in the final stage, members of both control and test groups of each center were randomized using a random figure table by the researcher. Samples were divided into two groups of test (26) and control (26). The questionnaires were filled by the members of both the groups before the intervention.

Nurses can meet this substantial need of the elderly by providing them with such religious interventions. Thus, it is suggested that certain training courses with the aim of making nurses familiar with concepts and implementing religious interventions be conducted. Other studies can consider the effectiveness of an Islam-based religious program on other chronic diseases in people with different social, economic, and age groups.</offsets></p><sec id="sec2-2"><title><offsets xml_i="26251" xml_f="26284" txt_i="19726" txt_f="19759">Financial support and sponsorship</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26295" xml_f="26299" txt_i="19760" txt_f="19764">Nil.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title><offsets xml_i="26358" xml_f="26379" txt_i="19766" txt_f="19787">Conflicts of interest</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26390" xml_f="26425" txt_i="19788" txt_f="19823">There are no conflicts of interest.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>It is necessary to note that this study was supported financially by the Research Deputy of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and was approved with the reg.
