In particular, the number of infants with intrapartum infection (N=5) was too small to draw any conclusions about the emergence of NVP and NRTI resistance mutations in this group. A second important limitation is that the infant plasma volumes were too limited to allow testing for minority variants using more sensitive methods such as allele-specific PCR or single genome sequencing. The detection rate for NVP and NRTI resistance mutations would be expected to be higher with more sensitive methods compared to population genotyping, as reported here.</offsets></p><p id="P17"><offsets xml_i="20569" xml_f="21475" txt_i="13676" txt_f="14582">Lifetime access to potent antiretroviral therapy for all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV (WHO Option B+) is rapidly becoming available in many parts of the developing world. As this access continues to improve, intrauterine HIV transmission will represent an increasing proportion of all pediatric HIV-1-infection; intrauterine infection accounted for 60% of all infant HIV-1 infections in this cohort, including late breastfeeding infection. Thus, the effects of antenatal and breastfeeding antiretroviral exposure on the acquisition of resistance mutations among infants with intrauterine infection should be considered carefully, as should new approaches to preventing resistance. Although the total numbers of HIV-1-infected infants may be expected to decline, the intrauterine infections that occur will undoubtedly be accompanied by new treatment challenges posed by drug resistance.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack id="S9"><p><bold>Financial Support:</bold> The study was supported by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health USA (ACTG Network Leadership Grant: 1U01AI068636-01; ACTG Statistical and Data Analysis Center Grant: 1U01AI068634-01).
