Objectives of the study were to explore the length of the adaptation period to obtain stable readings, evaluate responses to different substances, and measure the level and type of symptomatic and physiologic reactions to low-level exposures. Reported and observed symptoms, electrodermal response, heart rate, skin temperature, surface electromyogram, respiratory rate, contrast sensitivity, and the Brown-Peterson cognitive test were used and compared between cases and controls and between test substances (glue, body wash solution, dryer sheet) and control substances (unscented shampoo and clean air).

A critical factor that may have been overlooked in some of these studies is the adaptation of subjects to baseline study protocols. Adaptation is defined here as the period taken by the subjects in a study to get used to the general study protocols, obtaining stable physiologic (i.e., skin conductance and symptomatic) readings before the actual introduction of substances. We realized that with our patient population expressing a high level of reactivity, we would need to get stable readings before introducing any test substance. Otherwise, we might obtain erratic physiologic or symptomatic responses because of testing conditions, which would make it impossible to differentiate challenge substances from placebos. Surprisingly, we have not found any psychophysiologic literature discussing the importance of stabilizing readings before starting experiments other than the usual caution of a few minutes of relaxation. Most studies have either used a set period for adaptation (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ehp0113-001178"><offsets xml_i="10850" xml_f="10869" txt_i="5791" txt_f="5810">Fiedler et al. 2000</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10876" xml_f="10916" txt_i="5810" txt_f="5850">) or not considered this factor at all (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ehp0113-001178"><offsets xml_i="10963" xml_f="10987" txt_i="5850" txt_f="5874">Staudenmayer et al. 1993</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10994" xml_f="10996" txt_i="5874" txt_f="5876">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11003" xml_f="11406" txt_i="5877" txt_f="6280">Therefore, we hypothesized that individuals with ES may require more time to adapt to the experimental conditions compared with controls without chemical sensitivities.

Phasic responses may be evoked even by a discrete stimulus such as subtle variations in environment or even thought processes. Tonic skin conductance response is the baseline level of skin conductance in the-absence of any stimulus. This is known to vary with time in the presence of a stimulus depending upon the psychological state of the individual and their autonomic regulation. We considered only the tonic responses while assessing a positive response to challenge substances in our pilot study. Recordings showed variations in the level of conductance because of artifacts or other factors, and the change in amplitude and the length of the tonic response cannot be easily used in a continuous form without arbitrary criteria about where and how the measures will be made. Therefore, we adopted a simple criterion that could be easily reproduced: Tonic responses were considered positive if there was a change in amplitude from the preexposure period (of the session) by at least 0.5 microsiemens (μS) about 20 sec after the introduction of the substance.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21287" xml_f="21310" txt_i="15434" txt_f="15457">Booth session protocol.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21321" xml_f="21656" txt_i="15458" txt_f="15793">In an orientation visit we discussed details of the study with the subjects and answered questions about the study.

In addition, we did not use measures as sensitive as the electroencephalogram. The pilot study has also helped us identify skin conductance ranges in which a specific type of response, phasic or tonic, is displayed if a stimulus is perceived as a stressor. This will be critical for such studies because these ranges will help us identify what type of response can be considered given a specific range of baseline.

Other measures such as functional magnetic resonance imaging would certainly add understanding of the brain regions involved in the reactivity, but this will require unique laboratory conditions.
