The test group (n = 34) received Fortekor Plus twice daily. Two control groups received registered formulations of benazepril (Fortekor; Elanco Animal Health) and pimobendan (Vetmedin; Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica) with administration of Vetmedin twice daily and Fortekor twice (Control I, n = 14) or once (Control II, n = 19) daily. Diuretics were used in 22 dogs (32.8%). Global clinical scores decreased significantly from baseline in all groups; there were no significant differences between groups, and non-inferiority of Fortekor Plus compared to Control I, Control II, and combined Control I + II groups was demonstrated. There were no significant differences between groups for relevant clinical chemistry and hematology variables or frequency of all adverse events.

To our knowledge, good non-parametric statistical methods for testing non-inferiority are not available. Therefore, the data were analyzed primarily by applying the parametric RMANCOVA method. Despite transforming data where appropriate, the distribution of all secondary endpoints deviated significantly from normality in the RMANCOVA analyses, and the distribution of the primary endpoint approached significance (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="41709" xml_f="41710" txt_i="33547" txt_f="33548">p</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="41719" xml_f="41808" txt_i="33548" txt_f="33637"> = 0.088).

Diuretics were used in fewer cases (~30%) than is standard in many other countries, even though all dogs had evidence of pulmonary edema at baseline.
