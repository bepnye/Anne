Patients access the PEP-NG interface via wireless tablet and use a stylus to answer demographic, knowledge, and self-efficacy questions as well as prescription and over-the-counter self-medication practice questions. The PEP-NG analyzes patient-reported information and delivers tailored educational content. Patients’ outcome measures are self-reported antihypertensive medication adherence, blood pressure, knowledge and self-efficacy concerning potential adverse self-medication practices, adverse self-medication behavior “risk” score and satisfaction with the PEP-NG and APRN provider relationship. APRN outcome measures are knowledge and self-efficacy concerning adverse self-medication practices, self-efficacy for communicating with older adults and satisfaction with the PEP-NG. Time–motion and cost–benefit analyses will be conducted.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>self-medication</kwd><kwd>older adults</kwd><kwd>tailored

We expect that, in the control group, at most 30% of participants will experience a change in blood pressure control during the study period, that these changes will occur in both directions with equal probability, and that, by the end of the follow-up period, 35% of participants will have blood pressures in the controlled range (though not necessarily the same persons who had controlled blood pressure at study entry). In the intervention group, we also expect that up to 30% of participants will experience a change in blood pressure control during the study period, but that these changes will occur predominantly in the direction from the uncontrolled range to the controlled range. Under these assumptions, the sample size objective of 180 participants with complete data will provide 80% power to detect a 20% or greater increase in the percentage of participants with controlled blood pressure in the intervention group relative to the control group at the end of follow-up, ie, an expected frequency of 55% or more of intervention participants with controlled blood pressure by study completion. This power analysis accounted for random variation in the percentage of participants with controlled blood pressure at study entry in both the control and intervention groups (under the assumption of an expected frequency of 35%), for systematic differences and random variation in the percentages of participants who change blood pressure control status during follow-up (under the assumption of an expected frequency of 30% or less), and for correlations due to pairing of initial and final blood pressure control assessments within participants.

It empowers older adults with hypertension with a self-management mechanism that enables them to enhance their self-efficacy in self care, which is the corner stone of improving public health. The PEP-NG offers the provider advance knowledge of a patient’s self-medication behavior and literacy, which can be instrumental in facilitating patient–provider communication aimed at improving medication adherence and safety. If found effective in the current clinical trial, the PEP-NG has the potential for rapid adoption in the primary care setting and become a model for other self-management and medication adherence interventions directed at other serious chronic conditions (eg, diabetes, asthma, etc) that pose the major threats to public health.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Christian Rauh, MS and Yan Li, PhD for creating the computer code for the PEP interface, Zoe Strickler MDes for animation design, Jonathan Gill for wireless network configuration and server support and Sheri Peabody, MS, APRN, Jessica Planas, MPH, RN, and Karen Pasquale, MPH for their assistance in site recruitment, training and monitoring.
