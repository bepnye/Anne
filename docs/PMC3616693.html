Rabbits underwent glaucoma filtration surgery and were randomly allocated into one of the four treatment regimens: glaucoma filtration operation with no implantation of chitosan membrane group (as control), drug-free chitosan membrane implantation group (blank/placebo group), membrane containing 5-FU treatment group (5-FU group), and membrane containing MMC treatment group (MMC group). Each group consisted of 12 rabbits.

So far, there has been a lack of ideal and effective ways to solve the problem. Proliferation and migration of fibroblasts play an important role in the wound-healing process, and antimetabolite application has shown improved outcomes following glaucoma filtration operation. However, the systemic application of antimetabolites usually leads to damage of integrity of cornea epithelia, leakage of bleb, sustained low IOP, endophthalmitis, and scleritis, partially due to improper dosing of antimetabolites pre- and postoperation. The application of a sustained-delivery medicine system to release 5-FU and MMC locally provides a possible solution to avoid the potential complications when administrated systemically.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21903" xml_f="22166" txt_i="16342" txt_f="16605">Chitosan is deacetylated chitin, with advantages of ideal biocompatibility, biodegradability, ability to staunch bleeding, and antibacterial effects.

A possible reason for this is that though chitosan has a certain anti-inflammation effect, it is still a kind of foreign tissue that can incur inflammation. It is well known that cytokines and adhesive factors are rapidly released from macrophages once stimulated by explants, followed by increased permeability of blood vessels, accumulation of inflammatory cells (neutrophils and mononucleocytes), and exacerbated inflammation. This is very similar to what we found in the blank group, and confirmed by pathologic study showing massive infiltration of inflammatory cells under sclera in the blank group on day 28 after operation.
