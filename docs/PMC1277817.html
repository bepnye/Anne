According to the bibliography reviewed, physiotherapy, which is the most common action taken to alleviate this problem, has not yet been proven to be effective, because of the small size of sample groups and the lack of methodological rigor in the papers published on the subject. No reviews have been made to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating this complaint, but in recent years controlled randomised studies have been made and these demonstrate an increasing use of acupuncture to treat pathologies of the soft tissues of the shoulder.

The patients will be randomised into two groups: 1) experimental (acupuncture + physiotherapy); 2) control (TENS-placebo + physiotherapy); the administration of rescue medication will also be allowed. The treatment period will have a duration of three weeks. The main result variable will be the change produced on Constant's Shoulder Function Assessment (SFA) Scale; as secondary variables, we will record the changes in diurnal pain intensity on a visual analogue scale (VAS), nocturnal pain intensity on the VAS, doses of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) taken during the study period, credibility scale for the treatment, degree of improvement perceived by the patient and degree of improvement perceived by the evaluator.

In general, the conclusions of the analysts in the Cochrane studies, and of other reviewers working for professional organisations, is that there is very little evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of the treatment commonly applied for the painful shoulder. Therefore, well-designed studies are necessary, using uniform methods of diagnosis and measurement to ensure the validity of the results obtained.

Nevertheless, the results obtained with the experimental group were significantly better than those of the control group. A further problem is that the point proposed by the authors (Zhongpin of the leg) is difficult to locate, as its situation is not constant, on the contrary to that of Tiaokou (ST38), which is situated exactly 8 cun below the articular line of the knee and 1 cun lateral from the tibial crest.

The patients presented chronic symptoms of subacromial syndrome (rotator cuff tendinitis and subacromial bursitis) and were offered treatment with physiotherapy together with acupuncture or transcutaneous stimulus. They were informed of the characteristics of the study and of the techniques to be used, as well as of the possible risks (infection, lipothymia, hematomas). They were told they could leave the study at any moment, with no type of penalisation or loss of benefits to which they were entitled.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20351" xml_f="20369" txt_i="10673" txt_f="10691">Selection criteria</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20380" xml_f="20398" txt_i="10692" txt_f="10710">Inclusion criteria</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20405" xml_f="20550" txt_i="10711" txt_f="10853">• Patients with a clinical diagnosis of subacromial syndrome (rotator cuff tendinitis and subacromial bursitis) with a case history &gt; 3 months</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20557" xml_f="20597" txt_i="10854" txt_f="10894">• Prior radiography, with normal results</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20604" xml_f="20622" txt_i="10895" txt_f="10913">• Informed consent</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20629" xml_f="20648" txt_i="10914" txt_f="10933">• Unilateral injury</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20655" xml_f="21029" txt_i="10934" txt_f="11308">Exclusion criteria: surgery, luxations or fractures in the proximity of the shoulder; other severe direct or indirect traumas (in traction) observed in the anamnesis and clearly related to the onset of the current episode; hypocoagulates, generalised disorders of the musculoskeletal system or neurologic disorders, vascular trophic disorders in the lower limbs, lymphedema.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21051" xml_f="21067" txt_i="11310" txt_f="11326">Ethical criteria</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21078" xml_f="21961" txt_i="11327" txt_f="12206">The ethical validity of this study has been analysed and approved by the corresponding ethical and research committees at the healthcare centres involved.

This code is concealed from the evaluator. Each PDA system has three access codes, one for the study controller, one for the evaluator and one for the doctor carrying out the treatment, and only the latter has access to the treatment code.

These are the change in the SFA score, with respect to baseline values, after the 15th physiotherapy session. This assessment will be made by an external rehabilitation specialist with no information regarding the treatment received by the patient. Constant's Shoulder Function Assessment (SFA) Scale has a maximum score of 100 points, including subjective and objective elements in a proportion of 35/65, respectively. The subjective parameters describe the degree of pain felt by the patient and his/her ability to carry out normal daily activities, as regards both the level of activity and the position of the arm. The objective parameters are based on the range of active compound movements that enable the arm to be moved to functionally relevant positions, using a goniometer to measure the rear and lateral elevation and the positioning of the hand in relation to the head and the trunk in order to assess the degree of rotation achieved. The score for the power exerted by the shoulder is based on the weight (in kg) the patient can raise in abduction, to a maximum of 11 kg. A total SFA score of 100 indicates a shoulder with perfect freedom of movement, no pain and normal functioning.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="32948" xml_f="32967" txt_i="22429" txt_f="22448">Secondary variables</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32978" xml_f="33106" txt_i="22449" txt_f="22577">After the first week of treatment, the level of confidence in the treatment is measured on a Treatment Credibility Scale (TCS) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="33138" xml_f="33140" txt_i="22577" txt_f="22579">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33147" xml_f="33195" txt_i="22579" txt_f="22627">].
