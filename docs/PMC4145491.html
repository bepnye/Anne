Researcher observations and experiences in various pediatric wards confirm that what these children's parents receive is unstructured and disorganized information given to them by the physicians and nurses at the time of discharge, which is often forgotten due to lack of repetition and the use of medical terms in this education after discharge. These families should live their life in peace and physical and mental health from the time their children’ chronic disease is diagnosed, and have the ability of decision-making and determination of priorities for their own needs as well as their children's. The parents’ skills should be confirmed by nurses, although the families are deprived of this right.
