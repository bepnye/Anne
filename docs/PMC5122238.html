Exactly, 1 mg/kg hydrocortisone + 2 cc normal saline, 2 mg/kg hydrocortisone + 2 cc normal saline, and the same normal saline (2 cc) were injected to patients in M, P, and C (control) groups, respectively. The volume of each syringe was maximally 2 cc. The syringe was similar with respect to the shape and color. The study drugs were administered 10 min before spinal anesthesia. Fluid therapy and anesthesia method were the same in all three groups. All patients were NPO for 8 h and during this time, the fluid therapy was done according to 4-2-1 formula of serum (4 ml/kg/h for the first 10 kg of body weight, 2 ml/kg/h for the second 10 kg of body weight, and 1 ml/kg/h for the third 10 kg of body weight) and then intravenous midazolam 0.05 mg/kg was injected to all patients 5 min before the onset of anesthesia. Before the onset of anesthesia, 10 cc/kg of Ringer Lactate was injected to all patients within 30 min, and patients were routinely monitored including pulse oximetry, automatic control blood pressure, central and peripheral temperature, and 3-lead electrocardiogram. Oxygen was given to the patients via a face mask as 5 l/min until the end of the operation. Spinal anesthesia was performed at L4–L5 or L3–L4 of the spinal needle of 24-gauge, midline, and at sitting position. After leaving transparent and cerebrospinal fluid, 2.5 cc bupivacaine of 0.5% was injected within 10 s for the anesthesia. Then, the patient was immediately placed at supine position and the patient's head was put 15–20°C above the horizon and no analgesic drug was injected into the patient. The level of sensory block was determined using bilateral pin-prick test in midclavicular line. When the level of block reached to the desired level, the lower limb operation was started. The temperature of the operating room had been maintained at 21–22° and nonoperative parts were covered by a layer of cloth. After the operation, the whole parts of the body were covered by a layer of cotton blanket and then, the patients were transferred to the recovery room. The temperature of recovery room was similar for all patients, and no heating device was individually used for patients. The baseline level of the central and peripheral temperatures was measured. Moreover, immediately before anesthesia (on operating table), immediately after the anesthesia, 5 min after anesthesia, before and after drug injection, every 10 min during the operation, at the onset of entrance to the recovery room, and after recovery at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min, central and peripheral temperatures were measured by tympanic thermometer (OMRON Medizintechnik GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and an axillary thermometer (BMEcenter.ir, Iran). If the peripheral temperature was below 36°C, hypothermia would be considered. In hypothermic patients, if they had shivering with grade = 4. Meperidine 0.4 mg/kg was administered. To ensure that the study was double-blinded (both patients and physician who recorded the data), drugs were encoded by an operating room staff. All patients received postoperative routine nursing care and in all cases, basic rate of parameters including blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, shivering score (0, no shivering; 1, piloerection or peripheral vasoconstriction but no visible shivering; 2, muscular activity in only one muscle group; 3, muscular activity in more than one muscle group but not generalized; and 4, shivering involving the whole body), pain score, drowsiness score, and vomiting was recorded. The incidence and intensity of shivering was evaluated during intra- and post-operative periods. Hypotension (low systolic pressure below 100 mmHg or 25% reduction in systolic blood pressure compared to patients’ baseline pressure) was treated by intravenous Ringer lactate serum and 5 mg intravenous ephedrine. If the heart rate drops below 55 rates, the patients would receive 0.01 mg intravenous atropine per kg of body weight and if necessary, it would be repeated up to a maximum dose of 0.04 mg per kg of body weight. You should declare that as the ephedrine and atropine could alter the body temperature these nausea and vomiting were treated by 10 mg intravenous metoclopramide. All the received drugs, the number of frequency, and their dose were recorded. If patients had shivering Grade 4, meperidine 0.4 mg/kg was administered. The degree of sedation was evaluated as 1, fully awake and oriented; 2, drowsy; 3, eyes closed but rousable to command; 4, eyes closed but rousable to mild physical stimulation; and 5, eyes closed but unrousable to mild physical stimulation. The study data were entered into the computer after collecting and were analyzed using SPSS software version 20. Chi-square test (for comparison of qualitative data between groups), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (for comparison of quantitative date between groups), and repeated measure ANOVA (for comparison of trend of quantities date between groups) with repeated observations, and median test were run to analyze the data.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title><offsets xml_i="15282" xml_f="15289" txt_i="10311" txt_f="10318">RESULTS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="15300" xml_f="15639" txt_i="10319" txt_f="10658">In this study, ninety patients undergoing surgery with spinal anesthesia were investigated and assessed that during the study, no patient excluded from the study due to the incidence of unwanted complications such as hemodynamic and in the anesthesia method and all ninety patients were present in the study until the end of the study.

According to the results of our study, the incidence of shivering in the group receiving hydrocortisone including a dose of 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg was considerably and significantly less than the control group. On the other hand, patients receiving hydrocortisone had lower shivering; however, no significant difference was observed between the two doses of the drug.
