Peer reviewers – most volunteers – are of variable quality. An ongoing challenge for most journals is the recruitment and retention of individuals who can capably inform editors on study strengths, weaknesses, and who can craft accurate feedback to authors on how to improve their manuscripts. Contrary to many editor’s assumptions, the quality of peer reviewers cannot be predicted by their academic rank, formal research training, grant funding, or other traditional markers of academic achievement

Our mentors were not provided specific training in mentoring techniques, although most worked in academic settings where mentoring skills would be high. They had however a proven track record of high quality reviews over a long period of time, and an expressed willingness to mentor others. Mentors and mentees were encouraged to communicate by email or phone, but were not given more explicit or rigid guidelines, since in all regards we were aiming for an intervention that was logistically feasible and likely to be implemented by journals. As well, the actual mentoring and communication was not observed or evaluated by any outside party, so we cannot comment on its consistency. It is possible that the results of this study might have been different had the mentors all had formal training specific to this goal and/or the communication between mentor and mentee had been more standardized, more frequent, or mandated for a longer period of time. We did not implement these requirements because we felt that all these changes would limit compliance and would make it much less likely that a typical journal would invest the energy in implementing this technique.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29714" xml_f="30122" txt_i="19913" txt_f="20321">The absence of observed efficacy in our study might be theorized to have occurred because all of our new reviewers perform at a relatively high level of function and thus the potential margin for improvement is too small to be significant.
