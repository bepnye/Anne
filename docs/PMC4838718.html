The predictive low glucose management (PLGM) system incorporates continuous glucose sensor data into an algorithm and suspends basal insulin before the occurrence of hypoglycaemia. The system was evaluated in in-clinic studies, and has informed the parameters of a larger home trial to study its efficacy and safety in real life.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7202" xml_f="7222" txt_i="499" txt_f="519">Methods and analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7233" xml_f="8369" txt_i="520" txt_f="1653">The aim of this report is to describe the study design and outcome measures for the trial. This is a 6-month, multicentre, randomised controlled home trial to test the PLGM system in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The system is available in the Medtronic MiniMed 640G pump as the ‘Suspend before low’ feature. Following a run-in period, participants are randomised to either the control arm with SAPT alone or the intervention arm with SAPT and Suspend before low. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the time spent hypoglycaemic (sensor glucose &lt;3.5 mmol/L) with and without the system. The secondary aims are to determine the number of hypoglycaemic events, the time spent hyperglycaemic, and to evaluate safety with ketosis and changes in glycated haemoglobin. The study also aims to assess the changes in counter-regulatory hormone responses to hypoglycaemia evaluated by a hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp in a subgroup of patients with impaired awareness. Validated questionnaires are used to measure the fear of hypoglycaemia and the impact on the quality of life to assess burden of the disease.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8391" xml_f="8415" txt_i="1655" txt_f="1679">Ethics and dissemination</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8426" xml_f="8650" txt_i="1680" txt_f="1904">Ethics committee permissions were gained from respective Institutional Review boards.

The predictive low glucose management (PLGM) system uses a different predictive algorithm and was initially evaluated in our centre under standardised in-clinic conditions. The system was an investigational device and the predictive algorithm was incorporated into the BlackBerry Storm smartphone which controlled the insulin infusion in participants on the Medtronic Paradigm Veo insulin pump and Enlite glucose sensor with MiniLink REAL-Time transmitter. The system was tested with moderate-intensity exercise, excess subcutaneous insulin bolus, and increased overnight basal rates which are common triggers of hypoglycaemia. With each hypoglycaemic stimulus, participants were randomised to a control arm with SAPT alone and an intervention arm with PLGM. The system suspended basal insulin when the sensor glucose was predicted to be 4.4 mmol/L and found a reduction in the need for treatment of hypoglycaemia for all three settings in the intervention arm.</offsets><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="14304" xml_f="14306" txt_i="6135" txt_f="6137">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14313" xml_f="14551" txt_i="6137" txt_f="6375"> PLGM was also tested under in-clinic conditions in the PILGRIM study.

The PLGM system is available in the Medtronic MiniMed 640G pump (Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge, California, USA) as the ‘Suspend before low’ feature which automatically suspends basal insulin infusion when hypoglycaemia is predicted. This system is evaluated in the home trial. In contrast to the PLGM in-clinic study, the home trial is of a longer duration, evaluates spontaneous rather than induced hypoglycaemia, and uses sensor glucose values rather than plasma glucose values to quantify hypoglycaemia. Although this system is commercially available, there are as yet no randomised controlled home trials for evaluating its efficacy in real life situations.

We recruit patients with HbA1c &lt;10% to reflect a clinic cohort and to exclude participants who are less likely to comply and adhere to the protocol. Participants are approached through the diabetes clinics and are screened for eligibility in the study. Written informed consent is obtained from participants aged ≥18 years, and written parental consent and participant assent for those &lt;18 years of age. Consent is attained by the research nurse or the doctor who is not directly involved in the routine care of the patient and their families. A participant may decide to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their future care. The study duration for each participant is 6 months from randomisation. Based on previous unpublished data in a similar cohort of children and adolescents conducted in our centre, the control group is expected to spend on average 5.79% of the time with glucose level &lt;3.5 mmol/L, with a SD of 4.87%. 71 participants would be required in each group to have 80% power to detect a decrease of 2.3% (40% reduction or effect size of 0.475) in the time spent with glucose level &lt;3.5 mmol/L. It is anticipated that 175 participants would be recruited; based on the estimated dropout rate of 20%, this will ensure a total of 142 participants for the duration of the trial, with at least 71 participants in each arm. Recruitment will cease once this target is achieved. The study started in August 2014 and is currently ongoing.</offsets></p><sec id="s3a"><title><offsets xml_i="22456" xml_f="22467" txt_i="13208" txt_f="13219">PLGM system</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22478" xml_f="23248" txt_i="13220" txt_f="13990">The predictive algorithm is available in the commercially available Medtronic MiniMed 640G pump (Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge, California, USA) that is designed for CSII integrated with real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). The system consists of the Medtronic MiniMed 640G pump, CONTOUR NEXT LINK wireless blood glucose metre, Enlite glucose sensor and Guardian 2 Link transmitter. The transmitter sends the sensor glucose data wirelessly every 5 min to the pump and thereby provides real-time glucose measurements and trends. Calibration is required at least once every 12 h. The pump is uploaded to transfer information to Medtronic CareLink therapy Management Software through the use of CONTOUR NEXT LINK glucose metre, which is also the uploading device.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23255" xml_f="24665" txt_i="13991" txt_f="15401">‘Suspend before low’ is a SmartGuard function in the pump and suspends basal insulin infusion when sensor glucose is predicted to be below the set low limit in 30 min. The pump suspends basal insulin infusion when two criteria are met: the sensor glucose is at or within 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) above the set low limit and is predicted to be 1.1 mmol/L (20 mg/dL) above the set low limit in 30 min. The low limit is set for the entire study at 3.4 mmol/L and the pump would, therefore, suspend insulin infusion when the sensor glucose is ≤7.3 mmol/L (3.9+3.4) and predicted to be 4.5 mmol/L (3.4+1.1) in 30 min. If the alert before low is on, the patient will receive an alert when insulin delivery is suspended. Once the pump is suspended, the insulin infusion will resume after a maximum suspend period of 2 h or according to the autoresumption parameters if there is no patient interaction. Basal insulin will automatically resume if sensor glucose is above the low limit and trending upward, and insulin has been suspended for at least 30 min. However, the infusion may be resumed earlier if the patient intervenes during the suspend time and overrides the suspend function. The autoresumption feature was not present in LGS wherein the pump had a full 2 h pump suspension in the absence of patient intervention and is novel to the predictive algorithm to reduce the potential of post suspend hyperglycaemia.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24672" xml_f="24835" txt_i="15402" txt_f="15565">In the study, the low limit is set for Suspend before low feature.
