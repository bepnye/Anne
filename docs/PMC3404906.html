SMILE uses only one femtosecond laser to complete the refractive surgery, potentially reducing surgical time, side effects, and cost. If successful, SMILE could potentially replace the current, widely practiced laser in-situ keratomileusis or LASIK.

Our primary outcome is refractive predictability, which is one of several standard refractive outcomes, defined as the proportion of eyes achieving a postoperative spherical equivalent (SE) within ±0.50 D of the intended target. Randomization will be performed using random allocation sequence generated by a computer with no blocks or restrictions, and implemented by concealing the number-coded surgery within sealed envelopes until just before the procedure.

Moreover, this trial may show that SMILE has additional benefits, such as reduction in higher-order aberrations that leads to better quality of vision. On the other hand if we use a superiority trial design with a small sample size that fails to demonstrate any difference between LASIK and SMILE, would be inconclusive since it does not necessarily prove equivalence. Thus we use a non-inferiority trial design to compare our primary and secondary outcomes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23821" xml_f="24772" txt_i="17549" txt_f="18500">Despite its proven efficacy, LASIK still requires the use of two laser machines: one for the flap creation and another for the excimer ablation. This increases the cost as well as the surgical time for the procedure. SMILE uses only one laser machine, thus potentially reduces surgical time and cost. Moreover, SMILE does not involve any flap creation, which potentially reduces risk of side effects such as dry eyes. For these reasons, SMILE is potentially a new, improved form of refractive surgery, which may supersede LASIK and change clinical practice. There is also potentially a positive impact on healthcare as surgical time and costs are reduced with this new, ‘all-in-one’ laser procedure. Moreover, the needs for enhancements or retreatment are higher in patients with high myopia, a common condition in Singapore. SMILE can be used to treat high myopia without the extra costs involved in visual rehabilitation following LASIK enhancement.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24779" xml_f="25497" txt_i="18501" txt_f="19219">More importantly, in the longer term we propose that SMILE may potentially develop into a reversible surgical procedure. Unlike LASIK which uses an excimer laser to ablate or destroy corneal tissue, SMILE cuts and removes a piece of corneal lenticule, which may be stored and replaced into the cornea at a later time. This is important as we can potentially reverse the refractive procedure many years later when the patient’s myopia decreases and presbyopia sets in. The ability to re-implant the cornea lenticule allows for treatment of corneal ectasia, reversal or monovision, or even the possibility of a presbyopic implant. We have done preliminary studies to demonstrate corneal lenticule viability after ReLEx [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="25529" xml_f="25531" txt_i="19219" txt_f="19221">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25538" xml_f="26146" txt_i="19221" txt_f="19829">]; and in an experimental animal study, we demonstrated proof of principle of a reversible corneal refractive procedure for the first time (unpublished). We were able to successfully store and re-implant an autologous stromal lenticule into rabbit eyes with minimal resultant inflammation and no signs of rejection after 28 days. This is important as we can potentially reverse the refractive procedure when the patient develops presbyopia. The ability to re-implant the cornea lenticule allows for treatment of corneal ectasia, reversal of myopia, monovision or even the possibility of a presbyopic implant.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26153" xml_f="26563" txt_i="19830" txt_f="20240">In conclusion, this non-inferiority clinical trial that compares SMILE and LASIK will help to determine if this new refractive procedure, SMILE, has equal or better visual and refractive outcomes compare to the traditional LASIK for treatment of myopia. Results of this trial will likely impact clinical practice with potentially further development into novel techniques for re-implantation and reversibility.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26579" xml_f="26591" txt_i="20241" txt_f="20253">Trial status</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26602" xml_f="26610" txt_i="20254" txt_f="20262">Ongoing.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26638" xml_f="26651" txt_i="20265" txt_f="20278">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26662" xml_f="26782" txt_i="20279" txt_f="20399">LASIK, Laser in-situ keratomileusis; ReLEx, Refractive lenticule extraction; SMILE, Small incision lenticule extraction.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26804" xml_f="26823" txt_i="20401" txt_f="20420">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26834" xml_f="26892" txt_i="20421" txt_f="20479">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26914" xml_f="26936" txt_i="20481" txt_f="20503">Authors’ contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26947" xml_f="27171" txt_i="20504" txt_f="20728">All authors (MA, DT, JSM) participated in the design of the study, performed the statistical analysis, participated in its coordination, and helped to draft the manuscript.
