Locally, the number of general practitioner (GP) laboratory requests is increasing by 5% each year, and such requests currently account for approximately 25% of all tests performed by the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Trust. In relation to diabetes, over a six-month period from January 2004, GP requests accounted for 35% of all Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) requests processed and for 52% of all cholesterol (1,557 and 5,769 per month, respectively). There are several factors that may have contributed to this increase in demand (for example, shifts in the delivery of healthcare to primary care, the impact of clinical guidelines and protocols). Across the UK, the recent major increase in requests for several tests (including HbA1c and cholesterol) has been related to the introduction of a new GP contract that ties financial incentives to performance, particularly around chronic disease management [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="8193" xml_f="8194" txt_i="3343" txt_f="3344">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8201" xml_f="8202" txt_i="3344" txt_f="3345">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="8233" xml_f="8234" txt_i="3345" txt_f="3346">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8241" xml_f="8243" txt_i="3346" txt_f="3348">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8250" xml_f="8552" txt_i="3349" txt_f="3651">Although it is difficult to judge whether this trend represents an increase in clinically appropriate practice, it has highlighted the need for evidence on how to influence test-ordering behaviour and potential impact â in terms of volume â of using test results to influence other clinical behaviours.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8559" xml_f="8980" txt_i="3652" txt_f="4073">Available interventions to change test-ordering-related behaviours have not been systematically evaluated in a NHS setting.
