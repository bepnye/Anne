However, current single-coil rTMS technology only allows for effects in surface cortical structures. The ability to affect activity in certain deep brain structures may however, allow for a better efficacy, safety, and tolerability. This study used PET imaging to determine whether a novel multi-coil rTMS would allow for preferential targeting of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), an area always activated with pain, and to provide preliminary evidence as to whether this targeted approach would allow for efficacious, safe, and tolerable analgesia both in a volunteer/acute pain model as well as in fibromyalgia chronic pain patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5464" xml_f="5471" txt_i="857" txt_f="864">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5482" xml_f="5713" txt_i="865" txt_f="1096">Part 1: Different coil configurations were tested in a placebo-controlled crossover design in volunteers (N = 16).

One limitation of current rTMS technology is that deeper brain structures, known to be involved in pain perception, are difficult to target because magnetic field pulse strength rapidly drops as a function of distance from the coil into the brain, and beyond 2–3 cm from the scalp there is insufficient power from a single coil to produce action potentials [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="7970" xml_f="7971" txt_i="2933" txt_f="2934">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7978" xml_f="8470" txt_i="2934" txt_f="3426">].

The hyperalgesic effect observed after TMS with configuration C showed a similar decrease over time. Those effects are most likely not due to habituation, since similar trends were not observed for configuration A. Another factor that may explain the lack of effect of the 1Hz setting in the fibromyalgia patient population is the difference in age of subjects. In fact, the oldest volunteer was younger than the youngest fibromyalgia patient. Specific configurations might be necessary to obtain desired changes in brain plasticity depending on the age of treated subjects. Future studies should be performed to evaluate effects of age-specific rTMS configurations. A final explanation might be related to morphometric, and presumably cytoarchitectonic structural differences between the dACC of normal volunteers and those of fibromyalgia patients [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="25102" xml_f="25104" txt_i="15581" txt_f="15583">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25111" xml_f="25770" txt_i="15583" txt_f="16242">]. It may be that the smaller restructured dACC of fibromyalgia patients may be inherently less susceptible to low frequency pulses. Perhaps the most significant finding from these studies is the persistence of analgesic effects for at least 4 weeks after the final treatment session. This effect implies that multiple sessions of rTMS may be inducing neuroplastic processes. It will be critical, in future studies, to determine whether and to what extent these events are recognizable in structural and/or functional scans of similarly treated patients, e.g. reversal of the previously observed morphological differences in the dACC of fibromyalgia patients.</offsets></p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="25811" xml_f="25819" txt_i="16243" txt_f="16251">Figure 4</offsets></label><caption><p><bold><offsets xml_i="25845" xml_f="25953" txt_i="16251" txt_f="16359">Three coil configurations used in the PET imaging study are displayed over standard EEG10-20 coil positions.</offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="25960" xml_f="26539" txt_i="16359" txt_f="16938"> Large circles represent the coils, and the arrows within represent the direction of the primary electrical current within that coil at the point of contact with the scalp.

A possible explanation for this increased analgesic effect compared to the results of Short et al. could be that the shaped magnetic field pulses used in our study were capable of differentially targeting neuronal structures that are more critical in the neuronal pain circuitry (prefrontal cortex vs. dACC) – something that cannot be done using a single coil.

It may be that because our patient population started from a relatively low level on both scores, the lack of significance for the BDI-II may be due to a floor effect. It is interesting to note that this general trend of improved FIQ scores seemed to be independent of improvement in pain ratings, i.e. FIQ severity were not directly linked to extent of pain experienced from fibromyalgia. The general trend to improve in the FIQ could also be explained by an increase in patient care while enrolled in the study. An important implication of these results is that, since there was no correlation between improvement in depression and analgesia, it is highly unlikely that the analgesic effects observed were secondary to a treatment-induced anti-depressive effect.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28667" xml_f="28688" txt_i="18906" txt_f="18927">Appropriate sham rTMS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28699" xml_f="28972" txt_i="18928" txt_f="19201">An inherent problem of rTMS is choosing an ideal sham intervention.

In each case, scalp and auditory sensations would be very similar or identical to those sensed with configuration B. Similarly, despite being effective for acute pain in volunteers, the 4 coil 1 Hz rTMS configuration did not produce a significant analgesic effect in the chronic pain population, but still generated similar sensory cues.
