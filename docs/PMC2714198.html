However, this leech continued to exhibit the same degree of movement as the rest of the leeches in both groups. Thus, the presence or absence of an anchoring suture did not seem to affect leech mobility and did not have an immediate impact on leech survival.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="S3"><title><offsets xml_i="6758" xml_f="6768" txt_i="3639" txt_f="3649">CONCLUSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6779" xml_f="7037" txt_i="3650" txt_f="3908">This experiment was designed to examine the immediate impact of suture placement on leech survival.

For each feeding session, 1 or more leeches can be used depending on the size and severity of the congested area. Often the area of concern is not easily visualized or accessible by the patient. In these situations, the leeches often migrate to other areas of the patient body or even within the hospital room.

This group described the use of 4-0 or 5-0 sutures as âpassed through the leech approximately halfway along the length of its body, 2 to 3 mm from its side.â These researchers then secured the suture through the leech to a stack of surgical gauze. In addition, they noted that â[t]he application of the suture in no way seems to limit the ability of the leech to feed or move within the confines of the length of the suture.â Although the authors stated that the leeches continued normal feeding and movement after the placement of an anchoring suture, the issue of leech viability after suture placement was not addressed.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10694" xml_f="10853" txt_i="7247" txt_f="7406">The standard method for applying a leech involves loading one into an empty syringe without a plunger and pressing the open end over the desired treatment area</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="10884" xml_f="10885" txt_i="7406" txt_f="7407">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10892" xml_f="11648" txt_i="7407" txt_f="8163">; this can be a time-consuming activity for healthcare providers. The results of the present study suggest that it is possible to place a suture through many leeches at one time, thus making it easier to retrieve a single leech from a container and lessen the need for cumbersome forceps or empty syringes while handling them. The same anchoring suture can then be used to confine the leech to the surgical site during and after feeding. The present study supports the conclusion that a simple suture through the body of a leech does not alter short-term viability. In addition, the anchoring suture can aid in leech placement for the initiation of feeding, prevent leech migration during and after feeding, and simplify postfeeding retrieval of the leech.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11655" xml_f="12017" txt_i="8164" txt_f="8526">The primary limitations of this study are the lack of data surrounding leech feeding habits and whether an anchoring suture affects the quantity of blood removed.
