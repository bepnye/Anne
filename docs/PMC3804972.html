muscle massage on the strength and endurance of the deep neck flexor muscle in adults.
[Subjects] A total of 60 subjects were divided into an experimental group of 30 subjects
and a control group of 30 subjects. [Methods] The experimental group received massage of
the longus colli muscle, which is the deep neck flexor muscle, and the control group
received superficial neck muscle massage. The strength and endurance of both the
experimental group and the control group were measured before and after the intervention
using a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU). [Results] After the experiment, the strength of
DNF of the experimental group showed a statistically significant increase, and the
endurance of DNF of the experimental group showed an increase in its average value. The
independent sample t-test revealed no statistically significant differences in the groups.
[Conclusion] Massage of the longus colli muscle, which is the deep neck flexor, was shown
to improve its strength and endurance, which are measures of neck stabilization.
Therefore, longus colli muscle massage can be performed for patients who cannot perform
neck-stabilizing exercises or before performing other neck-stabilizing exercises.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Deep neck flexor</kwd><kwd>Longus colli</kwd><kwd>Massage</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="4109" xml_f="4121" txt_i="1317" txt_f="1329">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4132" xml_f="4930" txt_i="1330" txt_f="2128">In the daily lives of most modern people, the time spent working with the neck bent
forward, working on a computer, riding in cars, and engaging in leisure activities while in
a sitting positions has been increasing. This sitting causes overloads in the soft tissues
that support the neck, and repeated damage adversely affects neck stability. Therefore,
understanding neck-stabilizing exercises is necessary not only to prevent neck diseases but
also to reduce chronic neck pain. Recently, among therapeutic exercises, the importance of
stabilizing exercises that strengthen deep muscles, such as the longus colli muscle and the
longus capitis muscle, which play leading roles in maintaining the stability of the spine in
order to keep the cervical spine in the neutral position, has been noticed.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="4937" xml_f="5077" txt_i="2129" txt_f="2269">Many previous studies have reported that stabilizing exercises are quite effective at

the control group was given general neck massage. After applying the massage once, the
immediate effect was tested. In the experimental group, for massage of the longus colli
muscle, the subjects first lay down on massage table in the supine position and with C7
placed on the table, and C6 off the table in order to induce cervical spine extension. At
this time, the subject’s head was supported by the hands of the therapist in order to induce
slow extension. Thereafter, in order to find out the tonus of the longus colli muscle,
extension was induced to the left and to the right, while 15° of cervical rotation was
maintained. Then, massage was applied to the longus colli muscle on the side that was
thought to have high muscle tone, between the left and right longus colli muscles, in order
to relax this muscle. In this technique, the practitioner first checked the flexibility of
the subject’s throat and bronchial tubes by pushing the respective parts from left to right
using the index and middle fingers of both hands. Then, in order to relax a particular side
of the longus colli, the practitioner pushed the throat and bronchial tubes in the opposite
direction, while applying a horizontal force so as to have the longus colli exposed. After
this, the practitioner fixed his/her index and middle fingers on the subject’s throat and
bronchial tubes in a hook shape, and pressed the tense area of the longus colli with the tip
of the thumb of the opposite hand in the dorsal direction; then gently pressed again, by
placing the opposite thumb over the first thumb on the area. At this time, the therapist
compressed the muscle at strength that would not cause tonus of the superficial muscles
while sensing the relaxation of the longus colli muscle with the fingertips (</offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001"><offsets xml_i="9828" xml_f="9834" txt_i="6491" txt_f="6497">Fig. 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9841" xml_f="10162" txt_i="6497" txt_f="6818">).

statistically significant, increase in muscle strength after the experiment was found in the
experimental group. This result is considered have been the result of muscle relaxation
induced by direct ischemic compression of the longus colli muscle after the bronchus and the
esophagus had been pushed to one side. However, although endurance showed an increase in the
average value, the increase was not statistically significant. The independent t-test did
not find statisticaly significant differences between the grops, indicating that exercises
are more effective than massage at improving the strength and endurance of the longus colli
muscle. However, because patients with acute pain or elderly persons with low cognitive
abilities cannot actively participate in neck-stabilizing exercises, massage could be
applied to the longus colli muscle, which is the deep neck flexor muscle, as an alternative
method to improve strength and endurance, which are measures of neck stabilization.
Therefore, longus colli muscle massage can be applied to patients who cannot perform
neck-stabilizing exercises or before other neck-stabilizing exercises are performed.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ferreira</surname><given-names>PH</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferreira</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Maher</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Specific stabilisation exercise for spinal and pelvic
