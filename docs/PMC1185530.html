In practice, the SD of baseline HbA1c among the 245 patients recruited in Oxford was 0.9, but we assumed that the SD among additional patients recruited elsewhere could be as high as 1.5. With 205 further patients, the overall SD would be 1.2, and there would be 150 patients in each group (135 allowing for 10% attrition).

The proposed intention to treat analysis will compare mean levels of HbA1c at follow up between the three study groups, with baseline HbA1c as a covariate, using analysis of covariance.

Unit costs will be attached to the resource items collected from the healthcare resource utilisation assessment using published national average costs and tariff averages for procedures to calculate costs.

Firstly, the study is adequately powered to identify a reduction in HbA1c of 0.5%, which is associated with clinically important reductions in diabetic complications. Secondly, study participants allocated to the most intensive group are explicitly supported in interpretation of their study results in relation to lifestyle changes. This is the first study in this field to use standardised delivery of these interventions together with the other measures supporting fidelity to protocol.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34987" xml_f="36077" txt_i="24265" txt_f="25355">A further strength of the trial design is the inclusion of measures that explore the extent to which the interventions being used influences beliefs and behaviour. It will be possible to test whether the interventions, especially that based on the CSM, are successful in altering beliefs about diabetes, and whether the interventions were delivered with fidelity to their theoretical basis. It will also be possible to test whether differences in behaviour and HbA1c between experimental groups are due to the interventions bringing about changes in beliefs, as proposed by the CSM. Depending on the pattern of findings from the mediation analysis, it will be possible to conclude there is no mediation (none of the causal effect of intervention on behaviour is transmitted by beliefs about diabetes), total mediation (all of the effect is transmitted by beliefs) or partial mediation (part of the effect is transmitted by beliefs and part is direct). This will provide information about the extent to which the CSM can usefully inform intervention content to change beliefs and behaviours.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36084" xml_f="37248" txt_i="25356" txt_f="26520">The trial is mainly generalisable to that group of patients willing to be randomised to no self-testing. It will be limited in its ability to inform management of people who are enthusiastic about regular meter use. Not only does this group include people who have already been recommended to use a meter by their doctor or nurse, but also includes people who have obtained a meter in the absence of medical advice. In health service terms, these are people who are likely to obtain a meter whether or not they are prescribed or offered one. A trial to address management in this group would be more difficult because of difficulties in identifying individuals who are both enthusiasts, yet willing not to be exposed to the use of self-monitoring. However, the detailed information about beliefs and the pre-specified sub-group analyses will provide information to inform design of future studies in this area by allowing refinement of interventions and accurate estimates to inform sample size calculations The detailed information from blood glucose diaries and relation to outcomes will also inform the refinement of training programmes and data interpretation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37255" xml_f="37325" txt_i="26521" txt_f="26591">This trial has features of both a pragmatic and an explanatory trial [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"><offsets xml_i="37357" xml_f="37359" txt_i="26591" txt_f="26593">29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37366" xml_f="38153" txt_i="26593" txt_f="27380">]. The use of three parallel groups, delivery of interventions according to protocol and extensive measures along a causal pathway are characteristic of phase III or explanatory trials. The use of a primary care setting, comparison of three feasible health service strategies, wide range of recruitment a long duration, and estimation of costs are, however, more characteristic of a pragmatic trial. This hybrid design, whilst answering a health service question, will provide additional information to guide future research. The extent to which the trial is able to deliver data that informs both of these agendas will inform design of trials of emerging health technologies where the opportunity to understand underlying mechanisms may be lost in an effort to simplify protocol design.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38160" xml_f="38212" txt_i="27381" txt_f="27433">The results of this trial will be available in 2007.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38234" xml_f="38253" txt_i="27435" txt_f="27454">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38264" xml_f="38410" txt_i="27455" txt_f="27601">The authors hold no financial or non-financial competing interests.
