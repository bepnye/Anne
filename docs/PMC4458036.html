Over the last decade, maternal and under five-year-old mortality and morbidity rates have been successfully reduced in Cambodia, but newborn health has lagged behind. Evidence suggests that an important proportion of newborn mortality both globally and in Cambodia is attributable to infections and sepsis. While initiatives are being implemented to address some causes of newborn illness (related to pre-term birth and asphyxia), a country-level approach to reducing infections has not been formulated. The Newborn Infection Control and Care Initiative (NICCI) is a community and health facility linked intervention to improve health outcomes for newborns.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5146" xml_f="5160" txt_i="897" txt_f="911">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5171" xml_f="5806" txt_i="912" txt_f="1547">The present study applies a cluster randomized trial, using a stepped wedge design, to assess the impact of a package intervention on newborn health.

While this policy proposes systemic and programmatic improvements directed at the prevention of maternal mortality, it lacks specific strategies for newborn survival in the postnatal period. The persistently high rate of neonatal mortality in Cambodia may be due, at least in part, to the targeting of interventions at the antenatal, delivery, and immediate postpartum periods in the health care facility. Care coordination between the health facility and the community has not been strengthened sufficiently, and infants often receive either inadequate follow-up during the transition from birth facility to community, or no follow-up at all. A total of 63.6 % of mothers reported receiving a postnatal visit within the first four hours after birth, but only 7.4 % were seen by a health care professional four to 23 hours post-delivery, and only 11.3 % were seen in the crucial period of one to two days after the baby was born [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5"><offsets xml_i="9750" xml_f="9751" txt_i="4614" txt_f="4615">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9758" xml_f="9760" txt_i="4615" txt_f="4617">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9767" xml_f="9844" txt_i="4618" txt_f="4695">A number of trials have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7"><offsets xml_i="9876" xml_f="9877" txt_i="4695" txt_f="4696">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9884" xml_f="9885" txt_i="4696" txt_f="4697">–</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10"><offsets xml_i="9918" xml_f="9920" txt_i="4697" txt_f="4699">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9927" xml_f="10378" txt_i="4699" txt_f="5150">] illustrating the utility of home visits by community volunteers to reduce newborn mortality.

All cases will be used in the primary analysis, constituting an intent-to-treat approach.
