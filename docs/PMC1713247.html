This could imply that a school meal could have major impact on health later in life. However, because the study had too little statistical power, evidence for improve school performance and social behaviour in well nourished children could not be established.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26643" xml_f="26662" txt_i="18587" txt_f="18606">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26673" xml_f="26733" txt_i="18607" txt_f="18667">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26755" xml_f="26777" txt_i="18669" txt_f="18691">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26788" xml_f="27126" txt_i="18692" txt_f="19030">ASA, SH, IA, GJ and MH have all given substantial contribution to the study concept and design.
