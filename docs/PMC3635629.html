Reasonably, more FFP was included into pump prime in the treatment groups of infants and children. After heparin reversal, however, significantly greater transfusions of FFP were needed intraoperatively in the control groups of infants and children. Unlike in children, overall intraoperative transfusion requirements were significantly greater in the infants treatment group. The amount of FFP included in pump priming presumably made such a difference, because transfusion requirement excluding FFP in pump priming was comparable between the infants control and infants treatment groups. Of the transfusion requirements in the ICU, total amounts were numerically greater in the control groups of infants and children, but without statistical significances. Most of the differences in the transfusion requirements in the ICU in infants may be attributed to the greater requirement for FFP in the control group. After all, for patients in control groups, more FFP might be given after heparin reversal in the ICU and intraoperatively in infants and children, respectively. This means that FFP transfusion was done as a part of the postoperative hemostatic management at the discretion of the assigned physician, which may have resulted in comparable intraoperative bleeding and chest tube drainage in the ICU between the control and treatment groups of infants and children.

With respect to ROTEM measurements, however, clot initiation was delayed because CT in INTEM measurements was prolonged to nearly twice the upper normal limit after heparin reversal in both control and treatment groups, which is considered to be a residual effect of heparin. Clot formation was also delayed after heparin reversal because of prolonged CFT and reduced α-angle in both control and treatment groups. FFP in pump priming significantly improved delayed clot formation, which was shown by findings of significantly less altered CFT and α-angle in the treatment group. Clot firmness was reduced in both control and treatment groups after heparin reversal. However, the use of FFP in pump priming also significantly improved clot firmness in the infants treatment group, as evidenced by less reduced TEG parameters reflecting clot firmness, A10 and MCF. Reduced clot firmness demonstrated in both INTEM and EXTEM measurements could be attributed to platelet or fibrinogen deficiency. A reduction in clot firmness shown in this study was primarily attributed to fibrinogen deficiency because clot firmness was also measured to be reduced in FIBTEM, which utilizes platelet inhibition reagent. Moreover, platelet count was similarly reduced in both control and treatment groups after heparin reversal, but the fibrinogen level was significantly less reduced in the treatment group. Prevention of fibrinogen reduction in the treatment group may explain why clot firmness was significantly less affected by a dilution coagulopathy. Previously, it was demonstrated that fibrinogen level was important for clot strength especially in the setting of platelet deficiency.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"><offsets xml_i="27937" xml_f="27939" txt_i="21378" txt_f="21380">17</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="27953" xml_f="28734" txt_i="21381" txt_f="22162">In children, a similar pattern of dilutional coagulopathy to that of infants, delayed clot initiation and formation, and reduced clot firmness after heparin reversal.

In the consideration of less elevated CT in INTEM measurements, an equal restoration of ACT and much less reduced platelet count in both control and treatment groups after protamine administration, children undergoing congenital heart surgery were shown to be less affected by residual heparin and hemodilution, compared to infants.

As in infants, reduced clot firmness in the children control group could be attributed to fibrinogen deficiency, as parameters reflecting clot firmness were reduced in all ROTEM measurements after heparin reversal. In the children treatment group, however, clot firmness measured with FIBTEM was reduced from baseline value, but was nearly within the normal range. Furthermore, fibrinogen level was significantly less reduced than that in the children control group while platelet count between the control and treatment groups were comparable.
