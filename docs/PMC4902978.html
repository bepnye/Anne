In contrast, advance care planning (ACP), one of the most widely discussed and studied of all EOL conversations, is believed to enable patients to meet their EOL preferences. This is because ACP is an ongoing process by which the patient, in consultation with health care providers and/or family members/caregivers, makes decisions about their future health care should they become incapable of participating in medical treatment decisions. Further, it shifts the focus on EOL decision-making away from completion of documents and towards facilitating discussion about values and preferences regarding treatment and care, and involves family members in the discussion [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9"><offsets xml_i="10104" xml_f="10105" txt_i="3593" txt_f="3594">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10112" xml_f="10114" txt_i="3594" txt_f="3596">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10121" xml_f="10513" txt_i="3597" txt_f="3989">Despite the promise and popularity, there has been little research evaluating the effectiveness of ACP in meeting patient preferences, especially in Asian settings.

Secondary objectives are to compare heath care expenditures, quality of life, anxiety and depression, understanding of own illness, participation in decision-making and concordance with caregiver preferences for EOL care between patients receiving ACP and usual care. We hypothesize that patients receiving ACP will be more likely to receive EOL care consistent with their stated preferences, and have lower health care expenditures, better quality of life, lower anxiety and depression, better understanding of their own illness, greater participation in decision-making, and greater congruence with caregiver preferences, as compared to patients receiving usual care.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title><offsets xml_i="12412" xml_f="12426" txt_i="5732" txt_f="5746">Methods/design</offsets></title><sec id="Sec3"><title><offsets xml_i="12456" xml_f="12468" txt_i="5747" txt_f="5759">Study design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12479" xml_f="13099" txt_i="5760" txt_f="6380">This is a two-arm RCT of ACP versus usual care conducted at two institutions in Singapore –the National Heart Centre Singapore and Singapore General Hospital (Department of Internal Medicine).
