Many of these patients seek help in primary health care. Yoga can reduce stress and thus complements pharmacological therapy in medical practice. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated patients’ experiences of yoga treatment in a primary health care setting or, specifically, the experiences of yoga when suffering from stress-related illness. Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the meaning of participating in medical yoga as a complementary treatment for stress-related symptoms and diagnosis in a primary health care setting. This study has a descriptive phenomenological design and took place at a primary health care centre in Sweden during 2011. Five women and one man (43–51 years) participated. They were recruited from the intervention group (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="4463" xml_f="4465" txt_i="854" txt_f="856">n=</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="4474" xml_f="5225" txt_i="856" txt_f="1607">18) in a randomized control trial, in which they had participated in a medical yoga group in addition to standard care for 12 weeks. Data were collected by means of qualitative interviews, and a phenomenological data analysis was conducted. The essential meaning of the medical yoga experience was that the medical yoga was not an endpoint of recovery but the start of a process towards an increased sense of wholeness. It was described as a way of alleviating suffering, and it provided the participants with a tool for dealing with their stress and current situation on a practical level. It led to greater self-awareness and self-esteem, which in turn had an implicit impact on their lifeworld. In phenomenological terms, this can be summarized as </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5233" xml_f="5266" txt_i="1607" txt_f="1640">Another way of being in the world</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5275" xml_f="5530" txt_i="1640" txt_f="1895">, encompassing a perception of deepened identity.

There is no recognized “gold standard” treatment guideline or plan for the management of patients with stress-related symptoms, and pharmacological treatment is often the first choice. Other methods are therefore necessary.

There are numerous schools of yoga, most of which include breathing exercises (pranayama), postures (asanas), and meditation (dyana).

On a theoretical level, this is similar to what Bullington, Sjöström-Flanagan, Nordemar, and Nordemar (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002"><offsets xml_i="33834" xml_f="33838" txt_i="26423" txt_f="26427">2005</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33845" xml_f="34633" txt_i="26427" txt_f="27215">) described as “the move from disorientation towards a sense of coherence” (p. 269). This is part of the theoretical concept of “Meaning out of chaos,” where “being put together again” encompasses bodily, emotional, and cognitive-level experiences, including self-understanding and identity, in which the body is again experienced as “mine” and not as a troublesome broken machine. Emotions are experienced and accepted, memories can be captured and understood in relation to feelings and bodily sensations, while the experience of the self can be connected temporally to the past, present, and future. The ordering of chaos is a process which begins with a diagnosis, where increased self-awareness leads to a growing responsibility taking on the part of the patient (Bullington et al., </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002"><offsets xml_i="34669" xml_f="34673" txt_i="27215" txt_f="27219">2005</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34680" xml_f="34993" txt_i="27219" txt_f="27532">).

The findings also reveal bodily changes and bodily awareness by the yoga. The participants experienced an increased well-being and could better notice and understand bodily experiences.

This natural attitude (Husserl, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017"><offsets xml_i="45121" xml_f="45125" txt_i="35448" txt_f="35452">1999</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45132" xml_f="45735" txt_i="35452" txt_f="36055">), might not come as a surprise, as the participants at inclusion were suffering from symptoms from various parts of the body (e.g., their perception was turned towards the body as manifesting various discomforts). Nevertheless, the essence of the meaning of participating in medical yoga was found to be more comprehensive than the decrease of individual symptoms, which from a phenomenological perspective could be understood as the perceptions from our various senses being translated and unified within the individual body, and the body in itself is the one unifying the perceptions (Merleau-Ponty, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026"><offsets xml_i="45771" xml_f="45775" txt_i="36055" txt_f="36059">2007</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45782" xml_f="45842" txt_i="36059" txt_f="36119">). Finally, we would like to once more use Merleau-Ponty's (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026"><offsets xml_i="45878" xml_f="45882" txt_i="36119" txt_f="36123">2007</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45889" xml_f="46379" txt_i="36123" txt_f="36613">) words to highlight the essence of the meaning of participating in medical yoga: “To learn to see colours it is to acquire a certain style of seeing, a new use of one's own body: it is to enrich and recast the body schema” (p. 177). We believe that due to using the yoga (a way to use the body in a new way), the participants learned to see themselves and their lives differently, which enriched and recast their perception of their body schema and altered their way of being in the world.</offsets></p><sec id="S20013"><title><offsets xml_i="46407" xml_f="46436" txt_i="36614" txt_f="36643">Methodological considerations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="46447" xml_f="46801" txt_i="36644" txt_f="36994">We consider it valuable that the interviewer had met the participants prior to the interview, thus enabling them to feel secure. On the other hand, there is a risk that the participants could have provided the researcher with answers that they believed she would like to hear, as they were aware of her involvement in the intervention (Polit &amp; Beck, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030"><offsets xml_i="46837" xml_f="46841" txt_i="36994" txt_f="36998">2004</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46848" xml_f="46998" txt_i="36998" txt_f="37148">). However, the rich and vivid descriptions obtained do not indicate that this was the case. In line with descriptive phenomenology (Dahlberg et al., </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009"><offsets xml_i="47034" xml_f="47038" txt_i="37148" txt_f="37152">2001</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47045" xml_f="47280" txt_i="37152" txt_f="37387">), the analysis aimed to describe the meaning of participating in yoga based on the participants’ experiences. The intention was to avoid interpretation and explanations and bracket the researcher's pre-understanding (Dahlberg et al., </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009"><offsets xml_i="47316" xml_f="47320" txt_i="37387" txt_f="37391">2001</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47327" xml_f="47921" txt_i="37391" txt_f="37985">). We therefore believe that a strength of the study is the fact that the researcher who primarily conducted the analysis had no prior experience of yoga and had no contact with the participants during the intervention. Her professional background is that of a paediatric nurse with a great deal of experience of qualitative research. In order to further increase the credibility of the findings, the analysis was repeatedly discussed among all the authors. All three co-authors are physiotherapists; two of them were directly involved in the intervention, and the third had a supervisory role.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0014"><title><offsets xml_i="47983" xml_f="47994" txt_i="37988" txt_f="37999">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48005" xml_f="48078" txt_i="38000" txt_f="38073">The essential meaning of participating in medical yoga was summarized as </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="48086" xml_f="48119" txt_i="38073" txt_f="38106">Another way of being in the world</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="48128" xml_f="48574" txt_i="38106" txt_f="38552">, encompassing a perception of a new and deepened identity. Due to using the body in a new way (yoga), the participants had learnt to see things differently, which enriched and recast their perception of themselves and their lives. In the future, it would be interesting to perform metastudies based on findings from qualitative studies conducted after a yoga intervention, as there seem to be many similar experiences, irrespective of diagnosis.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the contribution of the interviewees who generously shared their experience with us and Maria Ekholm Takman for excellent assistance with transcribing the interviews.</p></ack><sec id="S0015"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>The study was funded by grants from the Research Committee of Örebro County Council and The Swedish Research Council (Reg. no. 2009-1385).</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bullington</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sjöström-Flanagan</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Nordemar</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nordemar</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>From pain through chaos towards a new meaning: Two case studies</article-title><source>The Arts in Psychotherapy</source><year>2005</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>261</fpage><lpage>274</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Büssing</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Michalsen</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Khalsa</surname><given-names>S.
