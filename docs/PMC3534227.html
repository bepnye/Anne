To our knowledge, this paper is the first to describe the ways in which ethical concerns shaped the design and implementation of a randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce DV among young women in a LMIC setting. Given the high prevalence of DV and young married women’s limited decision-making autonomy in India, risk analysis and minimization were a necessary part of the process of designing our study. Risk analysis involved using the published literature and our prior research to assess the nature, likelihood and severity of harms that may arise from participation in the proposed trial and was followed by identification of strategies to minimize risks and assessment of whether potential benefits of participation outweighed potential risks. The goal of this process was to ensure that our research did not inadvertently heighten women’s risk of experiencing DV. Below we describe the trial design and implementation as it was shaped by these ethical concerns.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="10786" xml_f="10833" txt_i="6405" txt_f="6452">The Dil Mil intervention: context and rationale</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10844" xml_f="11247" txt_i="6453" txt_f="6856">Marriage is a social necessity in India, and the vast majority of reproductive age women are married by age 25 to 29 years.

Safety alerts constitute “red flags.” They are events that may pose safety risks to participants, but may not involve participants directly, or if they do, are unlikely to be related to study participation or not considered to be severe. Examples of safety alerts include staff witnessing a family disagreement or conflict that is unrelated to the study, participant report of a minor altercation at home due to study participation, gossip in the community regarding study objectives, or enquiries about the study by family members. Miscarriages among DILs and illness episodes among MILs may be classified as safety alerts if they are determined to be unrelated to study participation. Safety alerts may warrant investigation by the study team to determine relatedness to study activities through discussion with participants and discreet gathering of information in the community (without jeopardizing participant confidentiality). Safety alerts may result in heightened monitoring of interactions with one or more participants, and will be reported to the IRB every six months.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37590" xml_f="38043" txt_i="28385" txt_f="28838">Adverse events are defined as unexpected, unfavorable, and serious events such as serious injury, self-harm, hospitalization, or pregnancy loss that are temporally associated with and likely to be related to study participation.

In our experience, responses to safety alerts need to be determined on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with the participant (when possible) and taking into account their best interests.

We will elicit qualitative feedback from participants on recruitment strategies to improve our ability to reach the most vulnerable young women in the future. In our prior longitudinal study, women with a history of DV were no more likely to be lost to follow-up than other women (ref), indicating that we will be able to retain this vulnerable group. Finally, because we are randomizing dyads in select geographic areas, contamination between study arms may occur, increasing chances of dilution of the treatment effect (a type ll error).
