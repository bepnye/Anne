Second, there was acknowledgement that SMUG could be more appropriate in particular cases, for example, owing to its less technical nature, so it should not be ruled out altogether.

Training on evidence, equipoise and unbiased delivery raised educators’ awareness of personal preferences and the potential for these to impact on delivery. Educators were confident that they had achieved unbiased delivery, but acknowledged the challenges involved. Their perceived ability to conceal their own preferences was helped by a strong sense of professionalism, the patient-centred nature of the DESMOND programme, and concessions in the RCT protocol. Educators’ explanations for their commitment to unbiased delivery included a desire for evidence-based knowledge in this contentious area, to inform both local healthcare commissioners and their own future practice with patients.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36170" xml_f="36560" txt_i="29246" txt_f="29636">It is not surprising that educators had personal opinions about the intervention variants; years of training, professional socialization and experience of working with individual patients with diabetes will have informed their views about effective management of the condition.

We argue that the importance of intervention deliverers ‘buying into’ the purpose of research highlights the value in training them in: the concept of equipoise, the potential impact of their preferences on the outcome of an RCT, the current state of community equipoise regarding the particular research question and the need for evidence. As discussed by others, the term ‘equipoise’ itself could help in such training of those less experienced in RCTs, by strengthening views and understandings of the challenging RCT situation; as the term is rarely used in everyday talk, it is less likely to cause confusion than words such as ‘uncertainty’ and ‘trial’, which may have several meanings outside the trial setting [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="41486" xml_f="41487" txt_i="34050" txt_f="34051">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41494" xml_f="42533" txt_i="34051" txt_f="35090">]. A key part of the training session in the current study was the emphasis that it was not aiming to convert each educator to a position of individual equipoise. Rather, the focus was on facilitating educators’ awareness of their individual views and their potential for these to impact intervention delivery, and providing them with the skills needed to prevent such an impact. Indeed integral to this was reassuring educators that not being in individual equipoise was acceptable, and that what mattered was awareness of one’s own preferences when in contact with participants. Our findings show that this approach was successful in raising the salience of the issue for deliverers, and suggest that it provided them with a useful resource in managing their own lack of equipoise when delivering the intervention. These are relevant and encouraging findings not just for those delivering an intervention in the RCT context, but for all personnel who have contact with participants, from the recruitment process through to trial closure.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="42584" xml_f="42595" txt_i="35093" txt_f="35104">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42606" xml_f="43298" txt_i="35105" txt_f="35797">This study provides insight into a new group of personnel in the area of research on trial participation: deliverers of behavioural (educational) interventions.
