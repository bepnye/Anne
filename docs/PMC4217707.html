Medical students were randomly allocated to title and abstract screening using one of the four modalities and required to screen 650 citations from a single systematic review update. The four screening modalities were a reference management software program (EndNote), Paper, a web-based systematic review workflow platform (ReGroup) and a mobile screening application (Screen2Go).

Firstly, we trialled a minimalist and easily scalable model where students did not receive any training in citation screening as part of the study. All students had received some general training in evidence-based medicine during their medical course, but this did not include specific training in the conduct of systematic review. Future work should explore the effect of different forms of training and support on participant performance. Secondly, participants were given very little guidance in the content area of the review, other than a one-page review protocol with inclusion criteria. Students may have received some previous training in the management of traumatic brain injury, but the gap between their knowledge and that of the review authors is likely to have been substantial. Furthermore, the study was conducted on an update to a review that the review authors had originally conducted, which may have contributed to their expertise on the specific topic of the review. Thirdly, incentives for participation were not linked to the quality of screening decisions. This may have encouraged students to complete the screening as quickly as possible, without regard to the accuracy of their decisions. For example, the title and abstract of Fraser 2011 (refer to Additional file </offsets><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"><offsets xml_i="29079" xml_f="29080" txt_i="20863" txt_f="20864">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="29087" xml_f="29201" txt_i="20864" txt_f="20978">) presents information indicating this is a potential included study, but 80% of students screened this study out.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29208" xml_f="30259" txt_i="20979" txt_f="22030">The primary endpoints of our study were the final sensitivity and screening specificity of citation screening. As with other screening tests, screening sensitivity is of greater importance than specificity to ensure relevant studies are not missed. Students randomised to perform citation screening using ReGroup, a web-based systematic review platform, achieved a significantly higher final sensitivity than those randomised to use EndNote, a widely used desktop reference management program. There were no differences in screening performance between the use of EndNote and either Paper or Screen2Go. The reasons for the improved sensitivity of the ReGroup platform are not clear, but may be related to the design of the user interface, which has been developed to improve the efficiency and experience of systematic review workflow, particularly less experienced users. As would be expected, this improved sensitivity was associated with reduced specificity, suggesting this modality may have lowered participants’ threshold for citation inclusion.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30266" xml_f="30854" txt_i="22031" txt_f="22619">The proportion of participants completing the screening task was numerically higher in the ReGroup and Paper groups. This may be related to the ease of initiation of screening. Login details were emailed to participants randomised to ReGroup, who then simply needed to click on a web link and could immediately commence screening. Similarly, participants randomised to use paper could immediately start screening using the mailed print outs and highlighter pens, whereas those randomised to use EndNote or Screen2Go had to load specific software to their computer or iPhone, respectively.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30861" xml_f="31357" txt_i="22620" txt_f="23116">Time taken to screen was measured across the four intervention groups to compare efficiency between the four modalities. This was similar across the four screening groups although analysis of this outcome is limited by differences in measurement technique. The objectively generated Screen2Go timings were numerically lower than the other three modalities. This may have been due to the improved efficiency of using a phone-based application or over-estimation of screening time with self-report.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="31364" xml_f="32162" txt_i="23117" txt_f="23915">There are some limitations to this study. The study was designed as a pilot study and the sample size limits the power of the study to detect small, but relevant differences. The selected study was based on a single Cochrane review update and the two independent expert reviewers had been involved in the original systematic review. Additionally, the medical students had received no prior training and were recruited from a single university. These results may therefore not be generalisable to other forms of review activity, such as full-text review or data extraction or to other groups of potential screeners, such as affected individuals and families.
