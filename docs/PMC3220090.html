Ten patients with 20 sites with maxillary bilateral Miller's class II facial recession defects were selected randomly into two groups of test (ADMA+CPF) and control (CPF alone) group with each group having 10 recession defects to be treated. The clinical parameters included plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), recession height (RH), recession width (RW), height of the keratinized tissue (HKT), and thickness of the keratinized tissue (TKT). These measurements were recorded at baseline and after 6 months post-surgery. Statistical analysis was made by the paired “t” test for intragroup and intergroup comparison was done by the unpaired “t” test. The percentage of root coverage for both the experimental and control groups were 82.2% and 50%, respectively. The changes from baseline to 6 months were significant in both the groups for PD, CAL, and RH; however, for parameters such as RW, HKT, and TKT significance was seen only in the experimental group. On comparison between two groups, only TKT showed statistically significance. It can be concluded that the amount of root coverage obtained with ADMA + CPF was superior compared to CPF alone.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acellular dermal matrix allograft</kwd><kwd>alloderm</kwd><kwd>coronally positioned flap</kwd><kwd>gingival recession</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title><offsets xml_i="4331" xml_f="4343" txt_i="1453" txt_f="1465">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4354" xml_f="4430" txt_i="1466" txt_f="1542">Root coverage procedures are usually indicated to achieve better esthetics.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1"><offsets xml_i="4463" xml_f="4464" txt_i="1542" txt_f="1543">1</offsets></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2"><offsets xml_i="4504" xml_f="4505" txt_i="1543" txt_f="1544">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4512" xml_f="4787" txt_i="1544" txt_f="1819">] Although several techniques have been proposed to achieve consistent and predictable root coverage, by some estimates, the average percentage of covered root surfaces resulting from different procedures performed under varying clinical conditions varies from 56% to 97.8%.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3"><offsets xml_i="4820" xml_f="4821" txt_i="1819" txt_f="1820">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4828" xml_f="4829" txt_i="1820" txt_f="1821">–</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6"><offsets xml_i="4862" xml_f="4863" txt_i="1821" txt_f="1822">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4870" xml_f="4949" txt_i="1822" txt_f="1901">] Thus, treatment of buccal recession remains a major challenge to clinicians.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6"><offsets xml_i="4982" xml_f="4983" txt_i="1901" txt_f="1902">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4990" xml_f="4991" txt_i="1902" txt_f="1903">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="4998" xml_f="5505" txt_i="1904" txt_f="2411">Many different surgical procedures have been used to achieve root coverage which include pedicle grafts (lateral sliding or double papillae) with or without connective tissue grafts, epithelialized autogenous grafts (free gingival), connective tissue grafts, coronally positioned flaps (CPF) alone, CPF preceded by a free gingival graft, and CPF with a simultaneous connective tissue graft.

This type of defect could be treated with many variations of three basic approaches; (1) pedicle soft tissue grafts; (2) free soft tissue grafts; and (3) combinations of the two. Among the pedicle grafts, the CPF is one of the valid surgical options to cover exposed root surfaces. It has many advantages over other surgical procedures used to treat the gingival recessions: it does not require a separate surgical site to obtain a graft, the tissue of the pedicle provides a perfect color/contour match with the surrounding tissue, the procedure is simple to perform, and does not require extended surgical or recovery time.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10"><offsets xml_i="17559" xml_f="17561" txt_i="12341" txt_f="12343">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17568" xml_f="18057" txt_i="12343" txt_f="12832">] The association of autogenous connective tissue graft with the CPF is also considered predictable; however, the second surgical site necessary to harvest the autogenous palatal donor tissue is a serious disadvantage due to increased risk of pain and post-operative hemorrhage. Therefore, an ADMA has been used as an alternative source of donor tissue. The material provides an unlimited supply of graft material that could be particularly helpful when treating multiple recession sites.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11"><offsets xml_i="18091" xml_f="18093" txt_i="12832" txt_f="12834">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18100" xml_f="18628" txt_i="12834" txt_f="13362">] The present study compared treatment of class II gingival recessions by coronally positioned flap (CPF) with or without acellular dermal matrix allograft (ADMA).

It was found that collagen stimulates platelet attachment, enhances fibrin linkage, and is chemotactic for fibroblasts. It also inhibits the apical migration of epithelium, allowing undifferentiated mesenchymal cells to repopulate the space and promote regeneration resulting in a stable attachment of the covering flap to the previously denuded root surface, thus preventing “subsidence of epithelium.” During healing period, the ADM graft might have acted as a shock absorber, deflecting the undue forces that otherwise would be transmitted to the fragile maturing fibrin clot on the root surface.
