We compare acupuncture with sham acupuncture on symptomatic improvements of pSS. A total of 120 pSS patients, aged at least 18, with DPF, will be randomly assigned to acupuncture or sham acupuncture groups, where they will have needle intervention for 8 weeks with 16 weeks of follow-up. Subjects will be assessed each time before interventions during the 8-week intervention, in week 8 after all interventions and in week 12, 16, 20 and 24 for follow-up with different measurements. The primary outcome are the proportions of subjects that have 30% or greater reduction in at least 2 out of 3 items of DPF in Numeric Analog Scale (NAS) scores (0 = the best, 10 = the severest), calculated between the baseline and the average scores of week 2 to 8. The secondary outcome are related to individual items of NAS scores, EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), Schirmer test score and unstimulated salivary flow, serum Immunoglobulin G, A and M levels, Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Salivary glands ultrasounds, Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale score. The secondary outcome scores are to be collected at baseline, in week 8, 16, and 24. Besides, individual items of NAS will also be collected in week 12 and 20.

According to TCM theory, Taiyang (EX-HN5), Cuanzhu (BL2), and Sizhukong (SJ23) are functioning in the eye disorders. Chengjiang (RN24), Lianquan (RN23) and Jiache (ST6) take actions on dry mouth. Waiguan (SJ5) and Zhaohai (KI6), as the points in the corresponding meridians distal to the local areas, act not only on dryness of eyes and month, but also on pain and fatigue. Thus, with these acupoints mentioned above, this study is designed to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on symptoms of pSS patients since the acupoints work well in coordination theoretically and seemingly clinically.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title><offsets xml_i="36235" xml_f="36246" txt_i="26934" txt_f="26945">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36257" xml_f="37987" txt_i="26946" txt_f="28676">Limitations include the restricted sample size and single centre. Although the study takes place in GAM hospital in Beijing, it is not possible to limit subjects into only local citizens as there is a large number of people immigrating to Beijing from all over China and so do the patients. Thus, the differences of people in different areas of China may interfere the outcomes of the trial. Although we only accept subjects having less than 5-year of symptomatic pSS, different durations of having it may also interfere the outcomes. Besides, we can’t eliminate the medicine interferences from those who are taking other medicines during the study. We don’t know what the informing strategy would actually and exactly bring to subjects mentally by telling them we are researching on a “new” method of acupuncture, although our initial purpose of doing so is to make subjects to have the same expectations from their interventions. Another limitation is that the acupuncturist knows assignments and he conducts, in which case the communication between the acupuncturist and subjects may, more or less, change the expectations of subjects, which would cause bias. What’s more, the acupoints studied in this trial are constant. It is not the way of applying acupuncture clinically in TCM way, in which case we wouldn’t know how acupuncture would act if it’s done with Differentiation Method, a way of diagnosis in TCM, which also directs treatments. Finally, if there is a third group by standard care, the result would be more convincing; while, standard treatments based on the guideline of pSS had not been established yet before the start of this study, and our fund is not financially supportive to set a third group of cohort.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>pSS</term><def><p>Primary Sjögren syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPF</term><def><p>Dryness, pain and fatigue</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAS</term><def><p>Numeric analog scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPF</term><def><p>Case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOP</term><def><p>Standard operation procedure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCM</term><def><p>Traditional Chinese medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GAM</term><def><p>Guang’anmen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BUCM</term><def><p>Beijing University of Chinese Medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDSSTCMPC</term><def><p>Statistical Department of State Standardized Traditional Chinese Medicine Pharmacology Laboratory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SFDA</term><def><p>State of food and drug administration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IgG</term><def><p>Immunoglobulin G</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAS</term><def><p>Statistical analysis system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intend to treat</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>Sponsor: Guang’anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The study is funded by Guang’anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science-National Chinese Medicine Clinical Research Model Basement.
