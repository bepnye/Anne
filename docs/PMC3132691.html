Adequate coronary flow was preserved in 71% (12/17) patients with significant stenosis of ostial LCX after LM-to-LAD crossover stenting. Thus, the real functional state of ostial LCX can be widely different from that appears on angiography. In the clinical context, there were 3 cases of TLR in deferred lesions. Two cases were related to LM-to-LAD stent restenosis. Only 1 TLR case (4%) was developed in 24 deferred LCX lesions. There was no cardiac death, stent thrombosis or MI related to lesions in which PCI was deferred according to FFR. Unfortunately, this prospective pilot study was not powered to detect a difference in clinical outcome.
