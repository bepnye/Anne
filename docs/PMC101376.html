Structured recall systems can improve the quality of care but the systems evaluated to date have been of limited sophistication and the evaluations have been carried out in small numbers of relatively unrepresentative settings. Hartlepool, Easington and Stockton currently operate a computerised diabetes register which has to date produced improvements in the quality of care but performance has now plateaued leaving substantial scope for further improvement. This study will evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of an area wide 'extended' system incorporating a full structured recall and management system, actively involving patients and including clinical management prompts to primary care clinicians based on locally-adapted evidence based guidelines.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="5087" xml_f="5094" txt_i="961" txt_f="968">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5105" xml_f="5323" txt_i="969" txt_f="1187">The study design is a two-armed cluster randomised controlled trial of 61 practices incorporating evaluations of the effectiveness of the system, its economic impact and its impact on patient wellbeing and functioning.</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5385" xml_f="5395" txt_i="1196" txt_f="1206">Background</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5415" xml_f="5454" txt_i="1207" txt_f="1246">Delivering care to people with diabetes</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5465" xml_f="5578" txt_i="1247" txt_f="1360">There is broad, international agreement over what constitutes high quality health care for people with diabetes [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="5609" xml_f="5610" txt_i="1360" txt_f="1361">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5617" xml_f="5618" txt_i="1361" txt_f="1362">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="5649" xml_f="5650" txt_i="1362" txt_f="1363">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5657" xml_f="5811" txt_i="1363" txt_f="1517">].

Firstly there are only five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1058 patients. All of these studies are 'patient randomised" trials, thus potentially under-estimating the effectiveness of the intervention (see Study Design). They were all evaluating more or less selected patients and general practices and none of them were explicitly evaluating a UK National Health Service (NHS) service area wide intervention.

It was introduced to all 36 general practices in Hartlepool and Easington Districts in mid-1995. Stockton (25 practices) agreed to join the system in 1999 and it was operational there by October 2000. There are three key components to the current system:</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8315" xml_f="8363" txt_i="3702" txt_f="3750">1.

Within secondary care, forms are completed at every new patient or annual review. In primary care, forms are completed by the practice nurse (usually) or general practitioner, either opportunistically or at practice diabetic clinics. In both cases, the completed data forms are sent to the Diabetes Register Facilitator for data entry. Thirdly, the hospital laboratory provides a monthly download of laboratory test details (e.g. HbA1c). A patient can be identified as having diabetes and added to the register by any permutation of one or more of these three routes. Feedback of individual patients' data, including review status, is provided to general practices quarterly. This feedback is 'passive' in that it does not explicitly prompt either patients or doctors as to required actions. Audit packages within the software can audit on every variable collected. District wide audit is provided on anonymised aggregated data; individual practice audits (with comparisons to other practices) are provided to participating practices at least annually. Feedback of the data to the patient (for hospital patients only) is by a patient information sheet and to the GP as a standardised letter. A Diabetes Register Facilitator co-ordinates and updates the register. A steering group composed of GH, the Diabetes Register Facilitator and representatives of the PCGs and patients, oversees the register and deals with issues such as confidentiality.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="10352" xml_f="10380" txt_i="5668" txt_f="5696">Impact of the system to date</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10391" xml_f="11103" txt_i="5697" txt_f="6409">Measures of the impact of the system to date relate only to Hartlepool, Easington and Stockton. The main impact on patient registration was in its first 12 to 18 months of operation: during 1995, 747 patients were registered on the system (0.4% prevalence) which had increased to 3867 (1.8% prevalence) by the end of 1996. The increase in registration has stabilised since then, reaching 4324 (2% prevalence) by 1999. During 1999, 70% of registered patients attended a clinic; 52% had their feet examined and 51% had their eyes examined. Seventy three per cent had an HbA1c result recorded and 69% a blood pressure measurement.

We believe that this is due to a lack of coordination (patients being lost to follow up) and lack of prompting of clinicians to deliver appropriate clinical interventions.

Westman Medical Software has agreed to amend the system as required. A 'circle of information exchange' will be established between the participating general practices and the database. The local guidelines will be used to adapt the current centralised database, along with the practices' preferred method of following up patients (for example, within consultations in routine surgeries or within special clinics). The central database system will identify when patients are due for review (based upon the local guidelines) and will generate a letter to the patient asking them to make an appointment for a review consultation. Patient information or educational materials could be included with the letter. At the same time, the central database will generate a letter to the practice stating that the patient should be making a review appointment in the near future. The letter to the practice will include a management sheet (to be held in the patient's record) to capture an agreed minimum data set to be collected during the consultation. This management sheet will also contain the relevant prompts (as described above).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19669" xml_f="20351" txt_i="14120" txt_f="14802">When the patient is seen in the practice, the primary care professional (currently this is usually done by the practice nurse) will complete the management sheet and return a copy for entry onto the central register within a designated period of time. This circle of information is broken if the patient does not visit the general practice as planned or the general practice does not return the management sheet to the central register. If this happens, the central register would alert the Diabetes Register Facilitator who will ascertain the reason for failure and take appropriate action, (e.g. send a reminder to the patient, prompt the practice to return the management sheet).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20358" xml_f="20900" txt_i="14803" txt_f="15345">A range of educational activities will be provided for intervention practices, as part of the usual local structures for contact with practices, with some additions, These will include: distribution of information about the trial in local newsletters; meetings with practice clinical governance leads; evening meetings for practice nurses (with small group discussion of the practical implications for intervention practices); and a telephone meeting with the practice diabetes lead (usually the practice nurse) in each intervention practice.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20907" xml_f="21003" txt_i="15346" txt_f="15442">Practices in the control arm will continue to receive the recall system as currently configured.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21025" xml_f="21050" txt_i="15444" txt_f="15469">Logistical considerations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21061" xml_f="21571" txt_i="15470" txt_f="15980">From the prevalence of patients with diabetes on the current register, there will be about 7500 patients on the system if 61 practices are recruited. Half of these will be in intervention practices. On current patterns of usage, we anticipate there being the need for 1.5 recalls per annum per patient on the register, resulting in about 6000 recalls per year for the intervention group. Assuming a 40 week working year, the system will need to dispatch, receive and process about 150 forms per group per week.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21593" xml_f="21619" txt_i="15982" txt_f="16008">Identification of patients</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21630" xml_f="22158" txt_i="16009" txt_f="16537">Patients for the structured recall and management system are already identified on the Hartlepool and North Tees database.
