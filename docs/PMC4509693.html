It is hypothesized that OVK + TAU will be more effective in reducing symptoms of depression in youth than TAU alone, immediately after the program and at three months follow-up. Regarding the explanatory mechanisms, it is hypothesized that OVK + TAU will decrease negative cognitive biases and increase the adequate coping styles. Both of these constructs are expected to mediate the hypothesized effect of OVK on symptoms of depression. Concerning the secondary outcomes, the OVK program is expected to decrease anxiety, since the program contains cognitive and behavioural strategies that are hypothesized to be effective not only for depression, but also for anxiety (e.g., to recognize and challenge threatening interpretations of neutral events, to employ relaxation strategies [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23"><offsets xml_i="14743" xml_f="14745" txt_i="8865" txt_f="8867">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14752" xml_f="14934" txt_i="8867" txt_f="9049">]).

If adolescents learn and adopt cognitive techniques to more adequately regulate their levels of anxiety, they will possess a higher level of self-control to regulate their behaviour, eventually leading to a decrease in problem behaviour. Lastly, the responsiveness of group care workers is hypothesized to increase more in the OVK + TAU group than in the TAU group alone. In the TAU+OVK condition, group care workers will be trained in therapeutic skills necessary to correctly implement the program, including listening skills, conversational skills, and techniques to increase group cohesion.

All treatment groups with adolescents between 12 and 16 years old, boys and girls, with a full-scale IQ of 50 or higher will be invited to participate. There are 20 treatment groups with 8–10 adolescents each that meet these criteria, of which are 8 youth care groups (Pluryn De Hoenderloo Groep), 8 groups for youth with MID (Pluryn Jan Pieter Heije), 2 mental health care groups, and 2 mental health care groups for youth with MID (Karakter child and youth psychiatry). Five groups (40–50 adolescents) include only boys, three groups (24–30 adolescents) include only girls, and twelve groups (96–120 adolescents) include both boys and girls. If the participants in the groups agree to participate, they will receive more information about the program and training, and the CDI-2 will be administered as a baseline assessment for depression (T1). Subsequently, groups will be randomly allocated to either one of both conditions. From the treatment groups selected, none of the adolescents will be excluded in order to avoid stigmatization and social exclusion. All parents will receive a letter with information regarding the goals and content of the study and will be asked permission for their child’s participation by passive informed consent. Since not all parents may understand written Dutch, given the expected social and ethnic characteristics of the sample, group care workers will ask the parents if they have understood the letter and if they have any questions. Parents and adolescents are free to withdraw themselves from the study at any time. Next, 2–3 permanent staff members of groups allocated to the intervention condition will receive a three-day training conducted by two experienced and licensed psychologists with broad expertise in cognitive behavioural therapy. Subsequently, T2 will be administered, and the training program will start.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title><offsets xml_i="21883" xml_f="21899" txt_i="15515" txt_f="15531">The intervention</offsets></title><sec id="Sec7"><title><offsets xml_i="21929" xml_f="21943" txt_i="15532" txt_f="15546">Program theory</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21954" xml_f="22031" txt_i="15547" txt_f="15624">The program OVK is based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25"><offsets xml_i="22064" xml_f="22066" txt_i="15624" txt_f="15626">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22073" xml_f="23034" txt_i="15626" txt_f="16587">]. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to alter maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behaviour by teaching people skills to recognize their automatic negative thoughts and the consequences on their feelings and behaviour, to challenge the validity of their thoughts, and to change maladaptive thoughts into more helpful, adaptive thoughts. If adolescents successfully adopt these skills, their maladaptive self-schemas will no longer be reinforced, thus creating the opportunity to change negative self-schemas into more adaptive, positive self-schemas. In this way, negative life events will no longer trigger depressive self-schemas, making adolescents more capable and resilient when resolving developmental challenges they encounter in the transition into adulthood. Adolescence provides an ultimate opportunity to preventively alter self-schema’s of depression, since cognitive functions and structures are not yet fully developed and still malleable [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26"><offsets xml_i="23067" xml_f="23069" txt_i="16587" txt_f="16589">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23076" xml_f="23078" txt_i="16589" txt_f="16591">].</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title><offsets xml_i="23110" xml_f="23127" txt_i="16593" txt_f="16610">Program structure</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23138" xml_f="23188" txt_i="16611" txt_f="16661">The original OVK program (for a description, see [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27"><offsets xml_i="23221" xml_f="23223" txt_i="16661" txt_f="16663">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23230" xml_f="23232" txt_i="16663" txt_f="16665">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28"><offsets xml_i="23265" xml_f="23267" txt_i="16665" txt_f="16667">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23274" xml_f="23446" txt_i="16667" txt_f="16839">]) was reviewed in an expert group of scientists and clinicians in the field of residential youth and mental health care, resulting in the following structural adaptations:</offsets><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="23485" xml_f="23687" txt_i="16839" txt_f="17041">Treatment duration: Given the relatively short treatment periods in residential care, the program was shortened from 16 to 8 sessions of 45 min, including only the CBT component of the original program.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="23717" xml_f="24075" txt_i="17042" txt_f="17400">Integration in existing treatment plans: The program was incorporated in the existing treatment plans by formulating goals for the training that matched treatment plans.

Concerning the explanatory mechanisms, it is hypothesized that OVK + TAU will decrease negative cognitive biases and increase adequate coping styles. Both of these constructs are expected to mediate the hypothesized effect of OVK on the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Secondary outcomes include anxiety, behavioural problems, and group therapeutic climate.</offsets></p><sec id="Sec16"><title><offsets xml_i="36791" xml_f="36816" txt_i="28285" txt_f="28310">Strengths and limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36827" xml_f="38193" txt_i="28311" txt_f="29677">An asset of the proposed study is that it is one of the first studies examining a program to increase emotional resilience in a residential setting and is also the only Dutch CBT program specifically adapted to adolescents with MID. There is a strong need for interventions addressing internalizing problems in this complex target group, given that youth in residential settings often display elevated levels of internalizing problems, but problems are often unrecognized and residential treatment is not sufficiently effective in reducing internalizing symptoms. Other than most RCTs, the present study not only examines effectiveness but also takes into account the possible mediators of change. Moreover, the study has a robust design, with a relatively large sample and assessments including multiple informants, and it takes place in a natural setting to optimize ecological validity and generalizability into real-life settings. Another strength is that the program will be group administered, thus enabling all adolescents in treatment groups to participate and minimizing stigmatization. This also optimizes opportunities for adolescents to implement the skills taught in OVK to their daily lives. Finally, the OVK program contains only eight sessions and takes place at treatment groups where adolescents live, therefore a minimal drop-out rate is expected.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38200" xml_f="39110" txt_i="29678" txt_f="30588">A limitation of this study is the open rather than blind design; as participants and other informants included in the assessments (parents and/or caregivers) are aware of the condition they are in, self-reports may be biased. Nevertheless, research assistants administering the questionnaires are blind to condition. Moreover, participants will be told that the program aims to ‘help them to better deal with difficult situations’, without mentioning the specific effects expected on the outcome variables, thereby minimizing expectation effects. Finally, the last planned follow-up assessment is three months. A longer follow-up period would have offered better chances to map longer-term effects of the intervention; however, then a large drop-out rate would be expected, since the follow-up period would extend the relatively short (6–12 months) period during which adolescents are in residential treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39117" xml_f="39844" txt_i="30589" txt_f="31316">With regard to the program content, a limitation is that mainly individual risk factors associated with depression will be addressed (e.g., negative cognitions, coping styles) as opposed to contextual risk factors like family characteristics, friends, and school situations. However, the program contains elements to teach adolescents how to implement the new skills across different contexts. For example, adolescents will make an implementation plan, with actions and helpful thoughts they can use across different situations to influence their mood. Moreover, the group care workers are strongly engaged in the program and are key persons to maintain contact with parents, family, schools, and leaders of leisure activities.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title><offsets xml_i="39877" xml_f="39902" txt_i="31318" txt_f="31343">Implications for practice</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39913" xml_f="40448" txt_i="31344" txt_f="31879">If the adapted OVK program is effective among youth within residential care in improving emotional resilience and in reducing (future) depressive symptoms, this may lead to better general outcomes of residential treatment on general functioning. Comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems are longitudinally associated with a higher prevalence of suicidal attempts and suicidal ideation, poorer academic performance, higher service use rates, and higher criminality rates as compared to youth with externalizing problems alone [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10"><offsets xml_i="40481" xml_f="40483" txt_i="31879" txt_f="31881">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40490" xml_f="40491" txt_i="31881" txt_f="31882">–</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15"><offsets xml_i="40524" xml_f="40526" txt_i="31882" txt_f="31884">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40533" xml_f="40784" txt_i="31884" txt_f="32135">]. Moreover, effectively reducing internalizing problems in this target group may also lead to a decrease in externalizing problems, as behavioural problems are believed to be mediated by deficits in internal impulse regulation and poor self-control [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24"><offsets xml_i="40817" xml_f="40819" txt_i="32135" txt_f="32137">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40826" xml_f="42063" txt_i="32137" txt_f="33374">]. If adolescents learn and adopt cognitive techniques to more adequately regulate their levels of anxiety, they will possess a higher level of self-control available to regulate their behaviour, eventually leading to a decrease in externalizing problems as well. Thus, the prevention of depression among adolescents with complex problems benefits adolescents themselves, their social contexts (family, friends), and society on a short- and long-term perspective. In addition, the program has the potential to reach as many residential treatment institutes and at-risk youth as possible, without stigmatizing groups, for the following reasons: (1) The program can easily be incorporated into existing residential treatment programs and can be administered by social workers. In this way, extra costs and efforts associated with implementation are kept to a minimum; (2) The program will be tested in all three residential youth care settings in the Netherlands (i.e. general youth care, youth mental health care and care for youth with MID); (3) An adapted version of the program is available for youth with MID; and (4) the program is designed to be accessible to all adolescents in the age of 12–16 years and has no exclusion criteria.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42070" xml_f="42410" txt_i="33375" txt_f="33715">Finally, this study will contribute to our knowledge about depression and anxiety in this complex target group and about factors that mediate intervention effects (cognitive styles, coping styles), which could serve as a starting point for further improvement of residential treatment programs and programs targeted at emotional resilience.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="42472" xml_f="42482" txt_i="33718" txt_f="33728">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42493" xml_f="43187" txt_i="33729" txt_f="34423">Internalizing problems are common among youth within residential treatment centres with and without MID, but are often overshadowed by the more visible and disruptive externalizing problems and therefore pose challenges in treatment and diagnostics. As a result, internalizing problems are often undertreated. This protocol describes a study examining the effectiveness of an adapted version of the Dutch CBT-based program OVK on depressive symptoms of adolescents with and without MID in residential treatment settings. This is the first Dutch study evaluating a group-administered CBT-program that is especially adapted to adolescents with MID. Mediators of the effect are taken into account.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors are both involved in the development of the program and in the effect study on the program.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors’ contributions</bold></p><p>MW has written this study protocol is responsible for the data collection, data analysis, and for reporting the study results.
