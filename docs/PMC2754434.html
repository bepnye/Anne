Costs during childbirth are dominated by the course of childbirth and type of delivery.

Hence, for these infants, resource use of infants and/or parents is measured during 12 months after childbirth. Direct non-medical costs in the antenatal and postnatal stages are generated by travel to and from health care providers, and time costs as the result of household shifts. Indirect costs are associated with lost productivity due to absence from paid work, predominantly in the postnatal stage.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19786" xml_f="19804" txt_i="11804" txt_f="11822">Statistical issues</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19824" xml_f="19835" txt_i="11823" txt_f="11834">Sample size</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19846" xml_f="20444" txt_i="11835" txt_f="12433">The sample size is calculated based on the primary outcome 'bad neonatal outcome'.
