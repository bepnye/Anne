Because the weights used were chosen to minimise the effects of chance on the weighted average, these equivalent numbers of deaths are approximately additive when information from different trials is combined, which helps to clarify how much each trial contributes to the weighted average.

Thus, even if the benefits of vitamin A supplementation were by chance exaggerated in the previous trial results, they are not zero. To interpret the randomised evidence, it is appropriate to bear in mind the apparent discrepancy between the results from DEVTA and from the average of the other eight trials, but also to bear in mind the overall result obtained by combining both (yielding a weighted average of all nine results). This finding might well be the best guide to the proportional mortality reduction that should be expected in the future from reasonably good compliance with a programme of supplementation in populations with widespread vitamin A deficiency that is not extreme enough to cause much risk of xerophthalmia.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34854" xml_f="35412" txt_i="27122" txt_f="27680">In such moderately deficient populations, the corresponding absolute risk reduction (and hence the number needed to treat for 5 years to prevent one death) depends on the child mortality rate, which varies substantially from one such population to another and from one decade to another, so no estimate of it is given. Provisional acceptance of a weighted average of all the trial results might offer an evidence-based way forward from current arguments about whether the effects of vitamin A supplementation on child mortality are substantial or negligible.</offsets><xref rid="bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="35457" xml_f="35462" txt_i="27680" txt_f="27685">23,24</offsets></sup></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="35482" xml_f="35676" txt_i="27686" txt_f="27880">The identical numbers of child deaths in DEVTA in the week before mass treatment and the next week is important evidence of safety, and suggests that the widely publicised observation from Assam</offsets><xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="35715" xml_f="35717" txt_i="27880" txt_f="27882">27</offsets></sup></xref><offsets xml_i="35730" xml_f="35805" txt_i="27882" txt_f="27957"> of a number of deaths just after widespread retinol dosage was misleading.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35812" xml_f="36621" txt_i="27958" txt_f="28767">Considering all of the randomised trial results, both the suggestion of no mortality reduction and the expectation of a large proportional mortality reduction are contradicted. The proportional reduction in child mortality achievable in such populations by good compliance with a programme of pre-school vitamin A supplementation is not zero, but it appears to be only about a quarter or half as great as the previous trials had suggested (perhaps 5–15%, to judge from the confidence interval for the weighted average of all trial results, rather than 20–30%). This, rather than the result of DEVTA alone or the results from the other eight trials without DEVTA, provides the most appropriate summary of the randomised evidence on the effect of vitamin A on child mortality in this and many other populations.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sommer</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tarwotjo</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Djunaedi</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Aceh Study Group.

DEVTA shows that the mortality reduction is not as great as previous trials had suggested, but does not show it is zero. (It also shows retinol supplementation is not followed by any acute increase in the risk of death.) An updated meta-analysis, based on an appropriately weighted average of the present and previous trials, now suggests that where vitamin A deficiency is widespread, but xerophthalmia is rare, the reduction in childhood mortality from full compliance with supplementation is likely to be about 5–15%, only about a quarter or half as great as previously suggested.</p></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
