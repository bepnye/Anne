Should such a change occur, it will be possible to assess using interrupted time series analysis whether an overall increase in the use of one-off HbA1c tests has occurred over time, because the study data on HbA1c testing will provide a near-complete record of all HbA1c testing in the study communities over the five-year study period.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34077" xml_f="34136" txt_i="25430" txt_f="25489">Variation in pathology assay techniques and instrumentation</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34147" xml_f="34318" txt_i="25490" txt_f="25661">HbA1c analysis results are subject to variation as a result of the type of equipment used, with the analysis method accounting for differences of up to 23% in the result [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36"><offsets xml_i="34350" xml_f="34352" txt_i="25661" txt_f="25663">36</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34359" xml_f="34360" txt_i="25663" txt_f="25664">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"><offsets xml_i="34392" xml_f="34394" txt_i="25664" txt_f="25666">37</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34401" xml_f="34642" txt_i="25666" txt_f="25907">].
