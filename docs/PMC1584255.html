Being inactive is a risk factor for all of these conditions. However, the physiological effects of inactivity are not well understood. In this trial, supported by the European Space Agency, a group of researchers aimed to further understand the effects of physical inactivity on the way that fat from the diet is metabolized (i.e., broken down to generate energy). 18 healthy male volunteers were randomized into two groups, both of whom underwent 90 days of bed rest, aiming to mimic sedentary behavior. One group also received an exercise training program during the 90 days' bed rest. The researchers examined to what extent two different types of fatty acids common in the diet were metabolized over the duration of the trial: oleate (monounsaturated fat) and palmitate (saturated fat). As secondary objectives of the study, body weight, water, fat, and energy expenditure were also examined in the participants.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9061" xml_f="9062" txt_i="3352" txt_f="3353">

However, they did see physiologically relevant changes in fat metabolism of one of the fatty acids, palmitate, over the course of the trial within both groups studied. Although metabolism of oleate (monounsaturated fat) did not show significant changes over the course of the trial, metabolism of palmitate (saturated fat) dropped by nearly 10% in both groups (bed rest, and bed rest plus exercise).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9804" xml_f="9805" txt_i="4076" txt_f="4077">

The purpose of the first step was to select 17 participants (14 participants, three replacements) for the first experimentation phase in 2001. Similarly, the second selection process started at the end of the first period. The medical checkup included: clinical examination and questionnaire to verify that no exclusion criteria were present; 12-lead electrocardiogram and measurement of arterial blood pressure and heart rate; testing for orthostatic hypotension; a questionnaire to evaluate the quality of participants' sleep; ophthalmologic examination (visual acuity and fundus examination); and biochemistry, hematology, serology, and toxicology analyses. In addition, in specialized departments (Rangueil Hospital, Toulouse, France) the following tests were conducted: echo-Doppler measurements of the lower limbs (to eliminate participants with venous insufficiency), front and side chest radiography, a dental panoramic radiography, abdomen radiography (to ensure the absence of lithiasis), abdomen echography, DEXA (dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry) measurement of bone density (which should be no more than 1 standard deviation [SD] above or below the age/sex-matched mean), and a measurement of maximal oxygen consumption. The preselected participants underwent psychiatric and psychological evaluations to ensure that participants would tolerate the conditions of the experiment.
