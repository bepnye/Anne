Our rationale for evaluating the ISEM module with unaffected households is that inherited susceptibility may be a factor among those without a positive family history of disease. Additionally, individuals may have incomplete knowledge of their family history when relatives have moved away or have died. Genetic research is incomplete in the context of podoconiosis making it difficult to know who carries inherited susceptibility. Lastly, high levels of stigma can limit willingness of individuals to report family history. The objectives of the ISEM were therefore to increase participants' understanding that while podoconiosis is hereditary it is entirely preventable; present a locally meaningful metaphor to explain how inherited or genetic ‘susceptibility’ paired with environmental factors increases risk for podoconiosis; link this explanation to the special importance of foot protection among those who are susceptible; and correct misperceptions concerning contagiousness and other folk understandings of podoconiosis risk (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="IHW016TB1"><offsets xml_i="13924" xml_f="13925" txt_i="7509" txt_f="7510">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13932" xml_f="14123" txt_i="7510" txt_f="7701">).

Lastly, these improvements in understanding increased the perceived value of foot protection. Taken together, these improvements support the acceptability, feasibility and potential benefit of implementing gene-environment education in LMICs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35801" xml_f="36113" txt_i="26380" txt_f="26692">The process evaluation also supported the promise of using culturally derived metaphors for explaining concepts in genomics and health. Such ‘common sense’ methods have been proposed to increase the coherence of explanations of health risks and as a means to encourage uptake of appropriate preventive solutions.</offsets><sup><xref rid="IHW016C26" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36156" xml_f="36158" txt_i="26692" txt_f="26694">26</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="36171" xml_f="36663" txt_i="26694" txt_f="27186"> However, how these metaphors stand up in the long term and the implications for stigma to re-ignite is as yet unclear. For example, in the context of podoconiosis, interpretations that likened susceptibility to a ‘soft’ or ‘angry’ body could over time become associated with weakness or negativity and ultimately lead back to social stigma. Thus, ongoing educational efforts likely would be beneficial to identify and address these misunderstandings before they become culturally entrenched.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36670" xml_f="37470" txt_i="27187" txt_f="27987">Additionally, LHEs' explanations of the distinction between sensitivity to the soil as the trait that gets passed down from generation to generation rather than the disease itself were not consistently understood by participants. For unaffected participants, this misunderstanding resulted in their over-emphasizing heritability. By contrast, affected participants with this misunderstanding tended to hear only that podoconiosis is not inherited but instead is purely environmentally influenced. The latter interpretation is understandable given the long affiliation of MFI with these communities and MFI's commitment to emphasizing prevention instead of the role of heredity. In turn, this may have accounted, in part, for our prior findings of lower increases in knowledge for affected households.</offsets><sup><xref rid="IHW016C25" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="37513" xml_f="37515" txt_i="27987" txt_f="27989">25</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="37528" xml_f="37696" txt_i="27989" txt_f="28157"> This is also congruent with another study which found a resistance among the public to identifying genetic components in health conditions identified as environmental.</offsets><sup><xref rid="IHW016C27" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="37739" xml_f="37741" txt_i="28157" txt_f="28159">27</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="37754" xml_f="37907" txt_i="28159" txt_f="28312"> Thus, such defensive responses to information about genetics should be anticipated and incorporated into programmes aimed at improving genetic literacy.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37914" xml_f="38327" txt_i="28313" txt_f="28726">While the LHE model showed promise for increasing genetic literacy, there were weaknesses observed during the early phases of the training and household education sessions. For example, some lay educators provided superficial presentations of the concept of heredity, improper and insufficient use of supplementary examples and visual aids, and incomplete messages (either stressing only heredity or environment).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38334" xml_f="39203" txt_i="28727" txt_f="29596">An additional limitation is that we cannot validate an association between the qualitative assessments of intervention response and actual uptake or sustainability of any improvements in the interface between inherited susceptibility and barefoot exposure. Consecutive process assessments at intervals might yield more information on accuracy of understanding and its association with sustained shoe wearing. Our intervention relied on partnering with an NGO that served affected individuals and engagement of community leaders. Obtaining funding to continue these efforts will be challenging. Initiatives of the National Institutes of Health such as the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) aimed to build capacity in genomic research and program implementation and could help identify approaches to build infrastructure to support genetic literacy in LMICs.</offsets><sup><xref rid="IHW016C28" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="39246" xml_f="39248" txt_i="29596" txt_f="29598">28</offsets></xref></sup></p><sec id="s4a"><title><offsets xml_i="39286" xml_f="39297" txt_i="29599" txt_f="29610">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39308" xml_f="39709" txt_i="29611" txt_f="30012">In conclusion, the results have future implications for efforts in genetics literacy building.
