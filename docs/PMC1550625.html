The authors have also noted an error in their previous analysis and changed the number of primary responders in mail group to 128, rather than 129. This change also affects Table 1 and Table 2, so that the denominator in the mail group should be 128 instead of 129 and the total respondents to be 227 instead of 228. Some of the numerators in this table were also revised after the authors noted an additional error in which respondents were attributed to each group. The original Figure 2 that was published omitted information at the bottom of the figure that we intended to be included, so this figure has also been updated. Due to a revised intention to treat analysis of the results to include all participants we contacted in both groups, Table 3 has been revised to include 221 participants in the denominator rather than 176 as originally published. Finally, the original publication included a figure (Figure 3) that represented the cumulative frequency of responses by group and by follow-up contact according to a per protocol analysis. This figure has been removed to avoid confusion and to keep the intention to treat analysis as the primary analysis of the results consistent throughout the paper.</offsets></p></body></article>
