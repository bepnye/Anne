Effective management of CKD, with emphasis on strict blood pressure (BP) control, reduces cardiovascular risk and slows the progression of CKD. There is currently an unprecedented rise in referral to specialist renal services, which are often located in tertiary centres, inconvenient for patients, and wasteful of resources. National and international CKD guidelines include quality targets for primary care. However, there have been no rigorous evaluations of strategies to implement these guidelines. This study aims to test whether quality improvement interventions improve primary care management of elevated BP in CKD, reduce cardiovascular risk, and slow renal disease progression</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6479" xml_f="6485" txt_i="842" txt_f="848">Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6496" xml_f="6537" txt_i="849" txt_f="890">Cluster randomised controlled trial (CRT)</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="6578" xml_f="6585" txt_i="892" txt_f="899">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6596" xml_f="6815" txt_i="900" txt_f="1119">This three-armed CRT compares two well-established quality improvement interventions with usual practice.

We are carrying out a cluster randomised trial because we feel that quality improvement is often adopted at the level of the practice. A trial of individual patients would be much more difficult because it may be impossible to stop contamination between general practitioners (GPs) and other health professionals working in the same practice; GPs may see successive patients from different arms of the trial; and communication between patients randomised to different arms of the trial might also bias results.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17594" xml_f="18028" txt_i="10574" txt_f="11008">The study has two components: a core cluster randomised trial (CRT) of 75 practices, and a parallel process evaluation and measure of how GP confidence changes over time.

He presented this at the funding meetings; he and MN created the combined bid which was funded by the Health Foundation. He is the principal investigator for the CRT. SdeL wrote the first draft of this paper with HG. HG worked closely with SdeL from the inception of the project and was a co-author in the original SGUL application to the Health Foundation. He is a senior investigator in the study protocol and co-wrote the first draft of this paper. TC has collaborated making many detailed contributions to the research protocol, and the developing study. TC has organised the SGUL study team. NT is one of the project co-ordinators for the study, responsible for recruiting and liaising with the southern locality practices. Contributed to the ideas behind the original grant proposal, attended the planning meetings, and helped edit the protocol also wrote parts of the organisational issues section. JvV designed the database and data management architecture for the study. MN worked with SdeL to create a single study from the originally separate bids. NJ: One of the project co-ordinators for the QI-CKD study, responsible for recruiting and liaising with the northern locality general practice. NJ also contributed to the development of the study. AT has generally contributed to the study through meetings and committees. He has also led on the development of a confidence questionnaire in general practice in managing chronic kidney Disease. EduB has contributed to the overall study and to the design of the economic evaluation. She has ensured that our dataset will be able to answer the research questions posed about cost effectiveness. IC has helped with the design of the in-depth process evaluation, the choice of focus groups, and the training of team members to run these. He will be responsible for the analysis of the data. NH has written all the MIQUEST queries used in the data collections for this study. He has also reviewed and contributed to the study design and methodology. FR worked with statistical colleagues to advise on the sample size and provided general specialist support for the development of this study. KH provided intellectual input to design of protocol, methodology, and execution.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research programme is supported by two peer-reviewed charitable grants.
