Participants (N = 391, 53.7% female) aged 65-90 years, English-speaking and with normal cognitive function, were recruited from metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. Participants in the intervention arm received capsules containing fish-oil at a daily dosage of 1720 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and 600 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid while the placebo arm received the equivalent amount of olive oil in their capsules. The primary outcome is rate of change in cognitive performance, as measured by latent variables for the cognitive constructs (encompassing Reasoning, Working Memory, Short-term Memory, Retrieval Fluency, Inhibition, Simple and Choice-Reaction Time, Perceptual Speed, Odd-man-out Reaction Time, Speed of Memory Scanning, and Psychomotor Speed) and assessed by latent growth curve modeling.

Cognitive function is a major determinant of quality of life in older age and decline in cognitive functioning is a primary contributing factor to increasing dependency in the elderly. Due to the ageing profile of the population, the financial, social, and other burdens that this dependency places upon society are of increasing concern. Thus, finding ways to prevent or ameliorate age-related cognitive decline is a public health imperative, with potential benefits not just in terms of lessening aged care costs but also in the enhancement of well-being in a growing segment of society.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7404" xml_f="7441" txt_i="3043" txt_f="3080">Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="7449" xml_f="7450" txt_i="3080" txt_f="3081">n</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="7459" xml_f="7557" txt_i="3081" txt_f="3179">-3 PUFAs) are one diet-related factor suggested to influence cognitive decline during ageing.

At baseline and final assessment, blood was taken for measurement of the following. Carotenoids, folate, and vitamin B12, were assessed, all having been associated with cognitive functioning in the elderly; this enables examination of cross-sectional associations between these measures and outcomes, and if necessary in the intervention analyses, to control for any potential differences between groups at baseline or any changes in these measures that differ between groups (despite randomisation).

It assesses the level of activity during a typical week in the last month. Minor changes to instructions were implemented to adapt the survey to a format suitable for self-completion. The questionnaire assesses work-, yardwork-, exercise-, caretaking-, and recreational-related physical activity, expressed as minutes per week, as well as current participation in several different types of activity categories believed to reflect physical activity dimensions. A total of eight indices are derived, three summary and five subscale indices, and a seasonal adjustment score can be calculated: 1) Total Time Summary Index, expressed as hours per week; 2) Energy Expenditure Summary Index, expressed as kcal/week</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="80056" xml_f="80058" txt_i="65121" txt_f="65123">-1</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="80064" xml_f="80430" txt_i="65123" txt_f="65489">; and 3) Activity Dimensions Summary Score (sum of five subscale indices, vigorous activity, leisurely walking, moving, standing, and sitting, each derived by multiplying frequency score by duration score for each activity type and then multiplied by a weighting factor (based on relative intensity of activity), expressed as a unit score), expressed as total units.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="80452" xml_f="80462" txt_i="65491" txt_f="65501">Depression</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="80473" xml_f="80562" txt_i="65502" txt_f="65591">Depression was measured by the Centre for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49"><offsets xml_i="80594" xml_f="80596" txt_i="65591" txt_f="65593">49</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="80603" xml_f="80740" txt_i="65593" txt_f="65730">], a 20-item tool measuring depressive symptoms in the general population; it has been extensively validated, including on older adults [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91"><offsets xml_i="80772" xml_f="80774" txt_i="65730" txt_f="65732">91</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="80781" xml_f="80782" txt_i="65732" txt_f="65733">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93"><offsets xml_i="80814" xml_f="80816" txt_i="65733" txt_f="65735">93</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="80823" xml_f="81320" txt_i="65735" txt_f="66232">] and is widely used as a screening measure.
