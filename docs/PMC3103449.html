There have been no previous treatment trials in Maori who self harm and previous reviews of interventions in other populations have been inconclusive as existing trials have been under powered and done on unrepresentative populations. These reviews have however indicated that problem solving therapy and sending regular postcards after the self harm attempt may be an effective treatment. There is also a small literature on sense of belonging in self harm and the importance of culture. This protocol describes a pragmatic trial of a package of measures which include problem solving therapy, postcards, patient support, cultural assessment, improved access to primary care and a risk management strategy in Maori who present to hospital after self harm using a novel design.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5334" xml_f="5341" txt_i="949" txt_f="956">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5352" xml_f="5786" txt_i="957" txt_f="1391">We propose to use a double consent Zelen design where participants are randomised prior to giving consent to enrol a representative cohort of patients.

Of these 70% or 217 would have been eligible for this study. Assuming that we recruit participants at the same rate as the previous trial, that is 50% of eligible people, we would be able to recruit about 105 people a year from these DHB's, (or about 150 over eighteen months).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47068" xml_f="49740" txt_i="37147" txt_f="39819">Traditionally the main outcome measure in self harm intervention research has been the proportion of people repeating after one year which is generally around 18% (29). However there are two problems here one of which is particularly relevant for indigenous people. Firstly to significantly reduce this by a third to 12% would need nearly 600 people in each arm of a trial (assuming a power of 80% with a significance level of 0.05). This is particularly problematic in trials involving indigenous people who are less numerous than the majority population. In New Zealand there are about 1000 episodes of self harm involving Māori each year which represents about 840 people. Assuming similar rates of eligibility and recruitment as in the earlier trial this means that the maximum number of Māori who could be enrolled in a treatment trial powered on a significant reduction in the repetition rate is about 300 people a year. In other words a trial would have to involve every DHB in the country and recruit people for four years. We suspect that the chances of funding any such trial are slim. The second problem with repetition rates is that although they are clearly a key consideration they are not important for the four out of five people who do not repeat. Other outcome measures such as measures of distress, quality of life and cultural identity are also significant. For these reasons we have decided that the main outcome we are interested in after one year is the proportion of people scoring below 9 on the Beck Hopelessness Scale. We have chosen this measure for several reasons, it is the best predictor of future self harm attempts; it is a significant marker of distress; and we know from previous research that individuals who score 9 or more on this measure are at least ten times more likely to kill themselves in the next year. Lastly in our previous trial we had outcome data at three months or one year on this scale in 85% of cases. In the previous ACC trial the proportion scoring 9 or more in both groups at baseline was 50%. Using this as the main outcome measure with 80% power, a significance level of 0.05 and a reduction in the proportion scoring above 9 from 50% to 25% after a year will require 66 people in each group, a total of 132. Allowing for 15% non completion of the Beck Hopelessness Scale we will need to recruit 155 people which should be feasible to collect over the fifteen months of recruitment into this trial. The figure of 155 participants is those people who have been randomised and consented to be in the study. We would expect that we would need to randomise about double this number of people to achieve this target.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49768" xml_f="49776" txt_i="39822" txt_f="39830">Analysis</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49796" xml_f="49903" txt_i="39831" txt_f="39938">Statistical analysis will be by the biostatistics team of the Auckland Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU)</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49914" xml_f="51570" txt_i="39939" txt_f="41595">Data from the trial will be entered into an Oracle database at the CTRU and extracted into SAS for analysis.

Assessment of baseline comparability of the intervention and control group will be carried out via descriptive analyses for demographic information, method of self-harm, and previous history of self-harm. The proportion of people repeating self-harm in each group will be analysed using chi-squared test. We plan to analyse people whose index episode is a first presentation and those whose index is a repeat separately and together. The number of self-harm re-presentation episodes for the hospital and self report outcomes during follow-up will be analysed using negative binomial regression. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling will be used to analyze time to first re-presentation to hospital for self-harm and time to event for the mortality outcomes. The change from baseline to 3 months and one year in each of the repeated continuous outcomes will be analysed using mixed model regression. If baseline characteristics are found to be substantially different between the groups we will adjust for these in the regression modeling.

This has the effect of diluting any treatment effect and introducing a possible self selection bias. A CACE analysis is an attempt to correct for this. The assumption behind this is that those who consent to the intervention and treatment as usual are similar. We will test this by comparing the main factors which affect outcomes in both groups including the proportion of people presenting for the first time, gender and age.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="52291" xml_f="52318" txt_i="42246" txt_f="42273">Cost effectiveness analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="52329" xml_f="52687" txt_i="42274" txt_f="42632">We aim to collect the following data from all patients in the trial at three months and one year after the date of their index attempt.

It uses a novel design to try and overcome the problems of previous trials which have recruited small numbers of unrepresentative people. A strength of the study is that it is a pragmatic trial which aims to demonstrate the importance of a comprehensive approach to culture in assessment and treatment. A potential limitation is the analysis of the results which is complex and may underestimate any effect on the secondary outcomes if a large number of people refuse their consent in the group randomised to problem solving therapy as they will effectively cross over to the treatment as usual group. Another potential issue is collecting a high enough proportion of completed rating scales at follow up.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="56230" xml_f="56243" txt_i="45934" txt_f="45947">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="56254" xml_f="56593" txt_i="45948" txt_f="46287">BHS: Beck Hopelessness Scale; BSIS: Beck Suicide Intent Scale; CACE: Complier Average Causal Effect; CTRU: Clinical Trials Research Unit; DHB: District Health Board; GP: General Practitioner; HADS: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; PST: Problem solving therapy; SF36: Short Form (36) Health Survey; SOBI: Sense of belonging instrument</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="56615" xml_f="56634" txt_i="46289" txt_f="46308">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="56645" xml_f="56703" txt_i="46309" txt_f="46367">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="56725" xml_f="56747" txt_i="46369" txt_f="46391">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="56758" xml_f="57038" txt_i="46392" txt_f="46672">All authors contributed to the study design and study protocol.
