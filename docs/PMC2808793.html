Most importantly, patients can interact with a multitude of integrated factors including sensory stimulations of vision, smell, sound, and touch coming from the forest and trees, fresh air and wide open space, comfortable temperature, and humidity. Even patients who do not like to move autonomously in buildings can become more active in the forest. Increasing activity is important for functional recovery in depressed patients, which has been shown in studies about the usefulness of walking in anxious or depressed patients</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47"><offsets xml_i="34896" xml_f="34898" txt_i="28019" txt_f="28021">47</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34905" xml_f="34975" txt_i="28021" txt_f="28091"> and in opinions about the importance of behavioral activation in CBT.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48"><offsets xml_i="35007" xml_f="35009" txt_i="28091" txt_f="28093">48</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35016" xml_f="35755" txt_i="28093" txt_f="28832"> For this reason, programs or workshops with practical approaches in an interactive environment may be better than simple advice or education telling patients to increase their activity levels. A forest environment can also facilitate interaction of psychological as well as physical activities. People can easily meditate or reconsider interpersonal problems while in the forest setting. In the hospital setting, patients often resist or avoid opening their minds, but the forest makes them speak out easily or connect with themselves through an object in nature. Therefore, interacting with the forest environment increases physical and psychological activities, which may have resulted in the therapeutic effects observed in this study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35762" xml_f="36562" txt_i="28833" txt_f="29633">This study also had some limitations. It was hard to generalize our results because of the limited numbers of participants. Well-controlled, large scale trials are needed to generalize the effects of the forest on human mental health. The subjects were sequentially assigned to 3 different groups, and were not fully randomized. But, these environmental interventions cannot be blind to the therapist and the subject. We also have the limitation that we did not assess patients' motivations. Motivation is an important treatment factor for patients with depressive disorders, and may affect the decision of participation in this study and the treatment results. In the future, supplemental research will be required. Studies comparing natural environments other than the forest will also be required.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36569" xml_f="37115" txt_i="29634" txt_f="30180">As far as we know, this was the first report in Korea studying forest environment as a therapeutic modality on patients with major depressive disorder applying medical model on patients. It is widely accepted that the cost for the rehabilitation of chronically ill patients including major depressive disorder is a huge problem. For complete remission from major depressive disorder, pharmacotherapy should be combined with psychotherapeutic interventions, and use of adequate environmental elements like the forest may improve treatment outcome.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was carried out with the support of 'Forest Science &amp; Technology Projects (Project No. S110709L030110)' provided by Korea Forest Service.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>KB</given-names></name><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hays</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name><name><surname>Burnam</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Daniels</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>The functioning and well-being of depressed patients.
