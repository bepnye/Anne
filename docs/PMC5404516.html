This was a single-dose, crossover thorough QT study in healthy subjects who were administered intravenous (i.v.) gepotidacin as a therapeutic (1,000-mg) dose and supratherapeutic (1,800-mg) dose, placebo, and 400 mg oral moxifloxacin in 4 separate treatment periods. Gepotidacin caused a mild effect on heart rate, with a largest placebo-corrected change-from-baseline heart rate of 7 and 10 beats per minute at the end of the 1,000-mg and 1,800-mg infusion, respectively. Gepotidacin caused an increase of change-from-baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF), with a peak effect at the end of infusion. The largest mean placebo-corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) was 12.1 ms (90% confidence interval [CI], 9.5 to 14.8) and 22.2 ms (90% CI, 19.6 to 24.9) after 1,000 mg and 1,800 mg, respectively. ΔΔQTcF rapidly fell after the end of the infusion, with a mean ΔΔQTcF of 6.1 ms 60 min after the 1,800-mg dose. Exposure-response analysis demonstrated a statistically significant positive relationship between gepotidacin plasma levels and ΔΔQTcF, with a slope of 1.45 ms per μg/ml (90% CI, 1.30 to 1.61). Using this model, the effect on ΔΔQTcF can be predicted to be 11 and 20 ms at the observed mean peak plasma concentration after the infusion of gepotidacin at 1,000 mg (7 μg/ml) and 1,800 mg (13 μg/ml), respectively. In conclusion, gepotidacin caused QT prolongation in this thorough QT study, and a mean effect can be predicted to less than 15 ms at the highest expected plasma concentration, 9 μg/ml.

The QT/RR pairs from each subject were used for that subject's individual correction coefficient, derived from a linear regression model: log(QT) = log(α) + β × log(RR). The coefficient of log(RR) for each subject, βi, was then used to calculate the individually corrected QT for that subject with the following equation: QTc = QT/RR</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="39276" xml_f="39278" txt_i="26425" txt_f="26427">βi</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="39284" xml_f="39498" txt_i="26427" txt_f="26641">. The relationship between QTc (QTcF, QTci, and optimized QTcI) and RR interval then was investigated using on-treatment data (gepotidacin at 1,000 mg and 1,800 mg and placebo) by linear regression modeling: QTc = </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="39506" xml_f="39507" txt_i="26641" txt_f="26642">a</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="39516" xml_f="39519" txt_i="26642" txt_f="26645"> + </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="39527" xml_f="39528" txt_i="26645" txt_f="26646">b</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="39537" xml_f="39800" txt_i="26646" txt_f="26909"> × RR. The RR coefficient for each subject, βi, was then used to calculate the average sum of squared slopes (SSS) for each of the different QT-RR correction methods, using the method proposed by members of the FDA's Interdisciplinary Review Team for QT studies (</offsets><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="39831" xml_f="39832" txt_i="26909" txt_f="26910">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39839" xml_f="40030" txt_i="26910" txt_f="27101">). The correction method that resulted in the slope closest to zero for on-treatment data was deemed the most appropriate HR correction method and therefore was used for the primary endpoint.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40037" xml_f="41201" txt_i="27102" txt_f="28266">The primary analysis for gepotidacin was based on a linear mixed-effects model with ΔQTcF as the dependent variable and with time (categorical), treatment (gepotidacin at 1,000 mg and 1,800 mg, moxifloxacin, and placebo), and time-by-treatment interaction as factors and baseline QTcF as a covariate. Since this was a crossover design, period and sequence terms were also included in the model. Subject was included as a random effect for the intercept. Gender effect was added in the model for exploration; if period, sequence, and gender effects were not statistically significant at the alpha level of 0.05, they were excluded from the final model. An unstructured covariance matrix was specified for the repeated measures at postdose time points for the subject within-treatment period. For this analysis, the least-squares means and 90% confidence intervals were calculated for the contrast, termed gepotidacin − placebo. The same linear mixed-effects model was also applied to those QTc methods that have not been selected as the primary endpoint and to HR, PR, and QRS to compute the mean change between gepotidacin and placebo and the corresponding 90% CI.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41208" xml_f="41586" txt_i="28267" txt_f="28645">The analysis to demonstrate assay sensitivity was based on ΔQTc on moxifloxacin. The model described for the primary analysis was used. For the time points of 2, 3, and 4 h, the contrast in treatment, ΔΔQTc = moxifloxacin − placebo, was tested against the one-sided null hypothesis of a ΔΔQTc of ≤5 ms on the 5% level. Multiplicity was controlled by using a Hochberg procedure (</offsets><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="41618" xml_f="41620" txt_i="28645" txt_f="28647">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41627" xml_f="41898" txt_i="28647" txt_f="28918">). If, after this procedure, ΔΔQTc was significantly larger than 5 ms for at least one time point, assay sensitivity was considered shown. In addition, 2-sided 90% CIs were obtained for the contrast at all time points for descriptive purposes and was used in the figures.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41905" xml_f="42779" txt_i="28919" txt_f="29793">The relationship between ΔΔQTcF and plasma concentrations of gepotidacin was investigated by a linear mixed-effects modeling approach, for which 3 models were considered: (i) a model with an intercept, (ii) a model with mean intercept fixed to 0 (with variability), and (iii) a model with no intercept. Time-matched concentration was included in the model as a covariate, and subject as a random effect for both intercept and slope whenever applicable. For diagnostic purposes, a plot of standardized residuals versus fitted values was used to examine departure from model assumptions. The normal Q-Q plots of the random effects and the within-subject errors were used to investigate the normality of the random effects and the within-subject errors, respectively. A final assessment of the adequacy of the linear mixed-effects model was provided by a goodness-of-fit plot (</offsets><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="42810" xml_f="42811" txt_i="29793" txt_f="29794">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42818" xml_f="43275" txt_i="29794" txt_f="30251">). Via visual inspection of the goodness-of-fit plot, the assumption of linearity between ΔΔQTcF and plasma concentrations of gepotidacin and how well the predicted ΔΔQTcF matched the observed data in the regions of interest were checked. The linear exposure-response model that fit the data best (i.e., had the smallest Akaike information criterion and had predicted CIs similar to the observed CIs) was used to evaluate the exposure-response relationship.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>GSK thanks the study investigator, site staff, and subjects for their participation in this study.
