Women with metabolic risk factors will be randomised to receive a dietary intervention based on a Mediterranean pattern, supplemented with extra virgin olive oil and mixed nuts until delivery. The intervention will be delivered through a series of one to one and group sessions. The primary outcome is a composite maternal outcome of pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes and a composite fetal outcome of stillbirth, small for gestational age fetus or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Secondary outcomes include maternal, fetal, dietary and laboratory outcomes. We aim to randomise 1230 eligible women with metabolic risk factors. We will also compare the outcomes in women with and without these risk factors. The sample size will provide us with 80% power at 5% significance, assuming a 20% loss to follow-up to detect a 30% reduction in maternal and fetal complications.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8513" xml_f="8537" txt_i="1465" txt_f="1489">Ethics and dissemination</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8548" xml_f="9030" txt_i="1490" txt_f="1972">The ESTEEM trial is designed to provide a definitive estimate of the effects of Mediterranean dietary pattern in pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes.

Our strategy of providing cooking recipes specially developed to adopt local food culture and implement a Mediterranean cooking style could help the participants to better understand and comply with the intervention. The cost of acquiring nuts and olive oil is relatively high in the UK which could present a burden on the study participants. To improve adherence, we opted to provide the participants with extra virgin olive oil and mixed nuts throughout the study. This will also ensure the continuous availability of these nutrients throughout the lifetime of the study. The group sessions are aimed to reinforce the knowledge and the education on the benefits of Mediterranean diet, promote healthy eating habits, healthy shopping and sharing experiences among participants and will provide opportunities to explore obstacles and potential solutions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41440" xml_f="41685" txt_i="30295" txt_f="30540">Assessing adherence to the intervention is crucial to accurately interpret dietary trials' results.

Introducing this short tool is far less complicated and can even be conducted over the phone which will help to improve returns. The limitation of using such tool is the limited information collected on the whole diet and the narrow focus on the Mediterranean nutrients' intake.
