The MaCare trial combines a reduced follow-up strategy with additional psychosocial support. Less frequent follow-up can reduce the burden on medical specialists and costs. The educational group programme can improve QoL of patients, but also less frequent follow-up can improve QoL by reducing the anxiety experienced for each follow-up visit.

The telephone follow-up is performed by the nurse practitioner (NP) or breast care nurse (BCN) working at this hospital. An NP is a registered nurse who has acquired (at masters level) the expert knowledge base, complex decision-making skills and clinical competencies for expanded practice. The BCN is a qualified nurse who has had specialist training in breast care and who guides the patient throughout treatment. In this paper the term BCN is used and refers to both types of nurses. The EGP is held at cancer information centres. These centres are specialised in providing support to (ex-)cancer patients and their relatives through education and organising activities. Selecting participants from multiple centres and locations in the Netherlands allows us to include a representative selection of breast cancer patients.

To adequately perform the telephone interview, all participating BCNs attained a training, specifically developed for this study.

The group-format programme focuses on the first two stages of the transaction process theory of stress, the primary and secondary appraisal. The EGP therefore consists of two interactive group sessions of 2,5 hours of patient education. In the first session, which addresses the primary appraisal, a BCN provides information on possible side effects of the different treatments and issues such as prostheses, exhaustion, hereditary issues and financial consequences. Also, signs and symptoms of recurrences are discussed. A health care psychologist concentrates on psychological consequences, like anxiety, depression and changed family role patterns. The second session focuses on the second appraisal, i.e. information is provided on possible coping strategies and actions that could be undertaken when symptoms occur. Furthermore, information on the various health care workers and additional interventions is given. Discussions are stimulated by the speakers, addressing issues such as how to deal with anxiety, mood changes and changes in relationships. In this way, patients and their partners are stimulated to be alert to symptoms, and to enhance self-efficacy in adopting one of the proposed actions or coping strategies. It is expected that this will lead to a better QoL. During the second session a volunteer from the Dutch Breast Cancer Association presents regional activities available for participants. The EGP is completed with a relaxation exercise. After the two sessions, participants receive a small booklet encompassing the topics discussed in the programme. The BCN and health care psychologist use standardised presentations, so that the EGPs given during the time of this study are as similar as possible. Furthermore, by using standard presentations, different teams can lead the EGP and the programme will be easily transferable to other settings.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21745" xml_f="21783" txt_i="15126" txt_f="15164">Primary and secondary outcome measures</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21803" xml_f="21826" txt_i="15165" txt_f="15188">Primary outcome measure</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21837" xml_f="22132" txt_i="15189" txt_f="15484">The primary domain for improvement for both interventions in the trial is cancer-specific QoL.

Improvement of psychosocial support and information to patients could lead to a better acceptance of reduced follow-up. The trial reported in this paper combines these two aspects. By performing an economic evaluation parallel to the trial, the ultimate aim is to find an alternative and more cost-effective follow-up strategy. We expect the educational group programme to help breast cancer patients and their partners in dealing effectively and efficiently with the consequences of a recent diagnosis and treatment of a potentially fatal disease. This increase in perceived behavioural control is expected to improve QoL. The nurse-led telephone calls are expected to render visits to the outpatient clinic superfluous, which may subsequently reduce the anxiety experienced by patients for each follow-up visit. Looking at costs, the telephone follow-up is expected to be cost-saving, due to fewer visits to the medical specialist. The EGP is expected to result in a slight cost-increase per patient in the first follow-up year, as compared to standard follow-up. However, due to the expected increase in QoL it may yield 1) reduced health care costs and 2) possibly lower costs due to a reduction in productivity losses.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29792" xml_f="30312" txt_i="22486" txt_f="23006">The close cooperation with many centres enables us to reach a representative study population of women treated for primary breast cancer and enhances the generalisability of the trial results.
