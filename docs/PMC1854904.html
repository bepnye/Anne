This intervention will be tested in a General Practice setting in a pragmatic trial using existing Practice Nurses (PN) as coaches for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Actual clinical care often fails to achieve standards, that are based on evidence that self-management interventions (educational and psychological) and intensive pharmacotherapy improve diabetes control. Telephone coaching in our study focuses on both.

PNs from General Practices allocated to the intervention group will be trained in diabetes telephone coaching focusing on biochemical targets addressing both patient self-management and engaging patients to work with their General Practitioners (GPs) to intensify pharmacological treatment according to the study clinical protocol. Patients of intervention group practices will receive 8 telephone coaching sessions and one face-to-face coaching session from existing PNs over 18 months plus usual care and outcomes will be compared to the control group, who will only receive only usual care from their GPs.

In addition, the Practice Nurse coach places the same one-page chart of risk factor targets and notification of details of patient enrolment in the patient's file for when they next see their GP. The 'Coaching Program' involves five coaching telephone calls at six weekly intervals in the first 6 months, two coaching telephone calls at two monthly intervals between 6–12 months, a face to face coaching session at 12 months and one coaching call at 15 months.

This quality improvement cycle is a key feature of the COACH Program – each coaching session is used as the foundation for the next coaching session. There is no pre-set time frame for coaching sessions. The length of the calls is determined by the length of time the "coach" needs to establish a plan of action with the patient to be achieved by the next coaching session. Patients are able to contact their Practice Nurse coach between coaching sessions, for questions and further information as required. A specific software package designed for the COACH program is used in conjunction with the telephone coaching sessions to generate written reports for the patient summarising each verbal coaching session, and to inform the "coach" for the next session. Reports are posted to the patients and a copy is placed in each patient's file.
