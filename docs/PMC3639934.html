All messages highlighted discrepancy between students’ perceptions of the behaviours (descriptive norms) or social expectations of others (injunctive norms) based on findings from an earlier survey. Messages emphasised both overestimation of risk behaviours (e.g. alcohol consumption) and underestimation of protective behaviours (e.g. including soft drinks in a night out). While most previous social norms interventions have involved communicating exact levels of drinking (e.g. ‘xx% of students drink xx times/units per week or less’), in the Welsh sample, while reported drinking was lower than perceived norms, drinking levels were hazardous. That is, an average drinking occasion lay on the border of NHS definitions of binge drinking (8 units for men/6 for women), while most students did report drinking more than recommended weekly limits (21 units for men, 14 for women). Hence, communicating absolute values for drinking would risk further normalising hazardous drinking. A decision was therefore made to emphasise discrepancy rather than present absolute values. The intervention also differed from many social norms interventions in that it attempted to prevent uptake of risky behaviours rather than changing established patterns, with intervention messages communicated to students from entry to university onwards.

hall, with meal planners seen by a little more than half. Portable materials (i.e. those not fixed to the wall) were seen by a minority. However, there was substantial contamination, with 11-26% students in control halls seeing materials in their own hall. Large numbers of students also report having seen the materials in other students’ halls of residence. Overall, 43% of students in control halls report having seen posters, compared to 80% in the intervention group. Students were substantially more likely to report exposure to pro-alcohol promotions than to intervention materials. Overall, 429 (82.7%; 75.1% control students vs 79.8 intervention) reported having been exposed to promotions for happy hours, 430 (82.8%; 81.8% control students vs 83.6% intervention) reported exposure to promotions for drinking based events such as drink the bar dry, whilst 484 (93.4%; 92.4% control students vs 94.5% intervention) reported exposure to promotions for student drinking nights

Hence, students in intervention halls appeared slightly less likely to perceive that normative drinking levels lay in the harmful range. There was little difference between groups in terms of geometric mean or median unit per week estimates. Larger differences were observed where students are classified according to exposure, with 41% of students who had not seen any of the materials reporting a perceived norm in the harmful range by comparison to 29% of students who had. Mean injunctive norm scores were 9.8 (95% CI; 9.4 to 10.3) and 10.5 (95% CI; 10.0 to 10.9) for intervention and control participants respectively.

Furthermore, rates were highly differentiated across sites; in sites achieving the best responses, bespoke email lists targeted first year students, with 2 reminder mailings sent. In sites achieving the poorest rates, distribution relied upon electronic notice boards, or email distribution via course representatives. In one, the survey was given a lower priority than an existing survey, with clashes meaning that access was denied to distribution channels such as electronic notice-boards. In another, illness of the nominated contact coincided with the start of the distribution period, with no plans made to cover this work, leading to delays in identifying alternative distribution channels. Response rates were boosted by addition of a pen and paper version of the survey, delivered by researchers where universities allowed this.

It is unclear whether the large proportions of students not seeing materials other than posters arose from non-placement, from not being sufficiently noticeable, or disposal by other students.

However, while most who reported seeing posters in another students’ hall correctly recalled their core message, only half of control participants reporting seeing the posters in their own hall did so compared to almost 90% of those in intervention halls. This perhaps indicates either misreporting of exposure among control students, consistent with researcher observations which found no intervention materials in control halls, or relatively brief exposure. Given that twice as many intervention as control participants were exposed to materials, and given the higher recall amongst ‘exposed’ members of the intervention group, while reduced by contamination, one would perhaps still expect to have seen differences in normative perceptions between intervention and control groups if effects were large.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="65990" xml_f="66969" txt_i="42321" txt_f="43300">Between group comparisons offered equivocal evidence of impacts on perceived norms.

However, whilst not subjected to formal hypothesis testing, between group differences in relation to post-intervention drinking levels were small, regardless of whether compared by randomisation status or exposure to materials. One explanation for limited behavioural change, even where comparing students on the basis of exposure, lay in the fact that differences in normative perceptions appeared greater for students who drank within recommended limits, consistent with findings that heavier drinkers were more likely to reject messages as untrue.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="66976" xml_f="67536" txt_i="43301" txt_f="43861">In relation to acceptability of objective measures, most reported willingness to provide hair samples as an objective measure, though half stated that they would require payment to do so.

Furthermore, consistent with previous UK university based alcohol surveys [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="68068" xml_f="68069" txt_i="44356" txt_f="44357">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="68076" xml_f="68077" txt_i="44357" txt_f="44358">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"><offsets xml_i="68109" xml_f="68111" txt_i="44358" txt_f="44360">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="68118" xml_f="69428" txt_i="44360" txt_f="45670">], the study recruited more female than male undergraduates. Achieving higher overall response rates, and responses more representative in terms of factors such as gender, may be necessary to understand the reach and effects likely to be achieved by such campaigns. The development of the campaign was hampered by the fact that policy timetables did not allow for qualitative research with students to develop relevant and credible messages prior to implementation. Qualitative data conducted as part of the process evaluation, to be reported elsewhere, highlight a number of issues in relation to, which ideally would have been explored in developmental phases. Furthermore, outcomes are based on self-report. Nevertheless, the study benefitted from the fact that it was a pragmatic evaluation of a real world intervention, therefore offering high external validity, and highlighted challenges in relation to implementation and receipt often overlooked in social norms evaluations. Its findings demonstrate the importance of encouraging policy and practice partners to use exploratory trials prior to embarking on full-scale roll-outs or expensive definitive trials, and highlight a number of uncertainties and challenges which would need to be overcome in any definitive evaluation of a similar intervention.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="69473" xml_f="69484" txt_i="45672" txt_f="45683">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="69495" xml_f="70546" txt_i="45684" txt_f="46735">In terms of intervention delivery and content, significant development appears to be needed before definitive evaluation can be considered. There is perhaps a need for more prolonged efforts to engage with universities, maximise buy-in and improve local ownership of the intervention. Greater efforts are needed to enhance the visibility, credibility and relevance of social norms intervention messages, particularly amongst more hazardous drinkers who were more likely to dismiss messages as untrue. Whilst intention-to-treat analysis indicated no effect on perceived norms, there is tentative suggestion of reductions in perceived drinking norms among students exposed to the social norms intervention. This non-randomised secondary analysis should be interpreted with the caveat that those exposed to the intervention may have differed from those not exposed in other ways which influence these perceptions. Furthermore, impacts on behaviour appear negligible, with little difference between groups even where participants were grouped by exposure.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="70553" xml_f="71483" txt_i="46736" txt_f="47666">In relation to evaluation design, establishing effectiveness would require significant improvements in response rates. The study was clearly in some cases given lower priority than other activities, such as annual student surveys, and a longer time period may be needed to build relationships with universities, enhance buy-in, and negotiate more effective distribution methods. Given the greater effectiveness of bespoke email lists in eliciting student responses, by comparison to electronic notice-boards, a definitive trial should aim to negotiate construction of email lists to target first year students in all sites, perhaps requiring funding to incentivise their creation. Another means of boosting response rates is use of incentives. Whilst entry to a £100 prize draw was offered, many US based social norms surveys achieving response rates closer to 40% have included payment in the region of $10 for each participant [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="71515" xml_f="71517" txt_i="47666" txt_f="47668">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="71524" xml_f="71525" txt_i="47668" txt_f="47669">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"><offsets xml_i="71557" xml_f="71559" txt_i="47669" txt_f="47671">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="71566" xml_f="72297" txt_i="47671" txt_f="48402">]. Offering £5 per student would have inflated the cost of this study by approximately £8000 if this were to achieve a 40% response rate, with this figure increasing in line with the increase in size of a fully powered trial. Using cluster randomisation at the hall-level appears associated with contamination between trial arms, although given that recall of key messages was so much poorer among control students than intervention group students, one would perhaps still expect to see between group differences if intervention effects were large. Research is needed to evaluate the acceptability and response rates achieved in practice where attempting to obtain hair samples from students as an objective measure of consumption.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="72319" xml_f="72338" txt_i="48404" txt_f="48423">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="72349" xml_f="72407" txt_i="48424" txt_f="48482">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="72429" xml_f="72451" txt_i="48484" txt_f="48506">Authors’ contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="72462" xml_f="72647" txt_i="48507" txt_f="48692">GM led the development, distribution and analysis of survey measures and drafted the paper.
