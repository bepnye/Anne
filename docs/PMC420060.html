Commonly, the combination of an opioid such as fentanyl or morphine for analgesia and a hypnotic agent such as propofol or midazolam for sedation is used. All opioids have varying degrees of sedative effect at increasing doses. Elimination of traditional opioids is dependent on organ function, which is abnormal in the critically ill. The context-sensitive half-time of these drugs also increases with time. Because of this, the opioid component of a sedation regimen is usually kept to a minimum compatible with adequate analgesia, and patient comfort is provided by titrating the level of hypnosis. However, organ dysfunction and duration of drug infusion also affect the offset of effects of the hypnotic component. Prolonged use of both conventional analgesic and hypnotic agents is therefore also associated with an unpredictable and prolonged offset of effects in the critically ill.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7414" xml_f="7693" txt_i="2832" txt_f="3111">Remifentanil hydrochloride is a potent, selective μ opioid receptor agonist that has a rapid onset of action (about 1 min) and quickly achieves a steady state.

Although the weighted mean HR during the treatment period was significantly higher in the moderate/severe group than in the normal/mild group, the magnitude of the difference was not of clinical significance and could be expected given the differences between the two patient populations. This finding is also consistent with the slightly higher mean HR at baseline in patients in the moderate/severe renal group.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38994" xml_f="39004" txt_i="32423" txt_f="32433">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39015" xml_f="39992" txt_i="32434" txt_f="33411">In conclusion, the safety and efficacy of remifentanil has been investigated in a group of sick patients with varying degrees of renal impairment receiving intensive care. Remifentanil was shown to be a very effective agent for providing both analgesia and sedation. Accumulation of remifentanil acid in patients with renal impairment was not associated with clinically significant prolonged μ opioid effects, as demonstrated by the times to offset of the pharmacodynamic effects of remifentanil at the SDTs during the 72 hour period of infusion. There were also no clinically relevant differences in times to offset of effects between patients with normal/mild and moderate/ severe renal impairment. Remifentanil was well tolerated, and the adverse event profile was consistent with what would be expected in ICU patients receiving a potent μ opioid agonist. The safety and efficacy of remifentanil is now undergoing investigation in critically ill patients for up to 10 days.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="40014" xml_f="40033" txt_i="33413" txt_f="33432">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40044" xml_f="40251" txt_i="33433" txt_f="33640">DB, AW, AB, VB, JB, PK and SA received payment from GlaxoSmithKline (either personally or to their respective departments) according to the number of patients recruited.
