The educational sessions was carried out among groups of 10–12 inside the center by means of speeches, face to face Q and As, group discussions and displaying educational films. Every group had 3 × 1.5 h sessions. To sustain the educational program, pamphlets, booklets, and educational films were distributed among the treatment group. The control group received no kind of education. Given that the addicts were retained in the center for an average 1 month period, to carry out the research phone contacts had to be made with the samples to complete the data gathering process. Therefore, 2 months after the educational intervention, the samples were invited to come over to complete posttest questionnaires through phone or personal visits.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title><offsets xml_i="20361" xml_f="20368" txt_i="14585" txt_f="14592">RESULTS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20379" xml_f="20571" txt_i="14593" txt_f="14785">The mean age of the study participants was 33.31 years.
