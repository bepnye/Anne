The MOXFQ is a validated questionnaire which is self-reported (filled in by the patient). It contains 16 items, each with five response options comprising three separate underlying dimensions: walking/standing problems (seven items), foot pain (five items) and issues related to social interaction (four items). Item responses are each scored from 0 to 4, with 4 representing the most severe state. The scale scores representing each dimension are produced by summing the responses to each item within that dimension.

Although missing data is not expected to be a problem for this study, the nature and pattern of the missingness will be carefully considered—including in particular whether data can be treated as missing completely at random or missing at random. Reasons for ineligibility, non-compliance, withdrawal or other protocol violations will be stated and any patterns summarised. More formal analysis, for example using logistic regression with ‘protocol violation’ as a response is unlikely to be useful given the small sample size but may be considered if appropriate to aid interpretation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33563" xml_f="33814" txt_i="23861" txt_f="24112">Statistical methods for calculating the definitive RCT sample size will follow the conventional approach using four parameters: type I error, power, assumptions in the control group (response rate and standard deviation) and expected treatment effect.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title><offsets xml_i="33853" xml_f="33863" txt_i="24115" txt_f="24125">Monitoring</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33874" xml_f="34036" txt_i="24126" txt_f="24288">As this is a single-site feasibility study, a data monitoring committee and trial steering committee have not been convened.
