A number of prisoners took part at each of two prisons, one in Scotland and one in England. Prisoners’ feedback informed planning of the trial's logistics and conduct. For example, a prisoner illustrated to the PIs the size of a small tin that, on liberation, would contain all of his valuable possessions (which were few). This led to a desire for a naloxone kit which would be no larger than the size of a credit card which led in turn to the decision to contain the naloxone kit within a wallet.

None of these formulations contained the correct identified dose of 0.8 mg, and none had a stake needle (moulded/fixed needle). It became clear that a stake‐needle variant would only be available to the N‐ALIVE trial team as a ‘special’ preparation which would render the medication an investigational medicinal product which would have additional implications for trial conduct. The option of giving the N‐ALIVE participant two 0.4 mg ampoules or mini‐jets was ruled out because of the risk of contamination between the intervention and control groups; a participant leaving prison with two ampoules or mini‐jets could give one of them to a fellow released prisoner who had been assigned to the control group. Thus, the naloxone needed to be a single product for the purpose of the trial. None of the available products fitted our needs perfectly, but we concluded that a sufficient dose in single product form was most crucial. Accordingly, we selected the 2 mg pre‐loaded syringe as an acceptable formulation, in which there is more than adequate dose. This choice of dose necessitated additional instructions for administration to be limited to a 0.8 mg dose. We therefore developed instructions, and the DVD and YouTube contributions to teach the administration of a 0.8 mg dose from the 2 mg pre‐filled syringe formulation and safe disposal of the syringe to avoid its reuse for another person.

In theory, N‐ALIVE would cleave to this process, and once allocated by randomisation, the participant's N‐ALIVE pack would be placed with his/her valuable property. In practice, storage of the N‐ALIVE pack with the prisoner's valuable property was not always possible for a variety of reasons generally relating to security concerns. Trustee prisoners in some prisons had a degree of access to valuable property (and half the N‐ALIVE packs contained a needle) while, in other prisons, there were concerns that prisoners would get access to a needle before they had properly exited the prison on the day of their release. Another concern was a misconception that provision of an N‐ALIVE pack by security staff to a participant on their release might constitute secondary prescribing. As prisons gained experience, increasing numbers of prisons allowed packs to be placed in prisoner's valuable property.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37880" xml_f="38795" txt_i="24586" txt_f="25501">N‐ALIVE workers worked around the embargo on placing packs in valuable property and made alternative arrangements for prisoners whom they were expecting to be released or transferred. However, prisoners are often released, returned to court or transferred at very short notice. If a participant was transferred to another N‐ALIVE prison, then the trial team or the N‐ALIVE worker could often arrange transfer of the prisoner's allocated pack retrospectively, but this was much more difficult if participants were transferred to non‐N‐ALIVE prisons as we did not have the contacts to facilitate pack transfer. There were exceptions, staff at a number of non‐N‐ALIVE prisons accepted N‐ALIVE packs as participant prisoners’ property. Unfortunately, even after successful transfer to non‐N‐ALIVE prisons, we were often unable to confirm whether participants had received their packs when they were eventually released.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="dar12592-sec-0029"><title><offsets xml_i="38840" xml_f="38841" txt_i="25503" txt_f="25504">

JS is a researcher and clinician who has worked with a range of types of treatment and rehabilitation service‐providers, including treatments within prison and on prison‐release. JS is supported by the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London. He has also worked with a range of governmental and non‐governmental organisations, and with pharmaceutical companies to seek to identify new or improved treatments (including naloxone products) from whom he and his employer (King's College London) have received honoraria, travel costs and/or consultancy payments. This includes work with, during the past 3 years, Martindale, Reckitt‐Benckiser/Indivior, MundiPharma, Braeburn/MedPace and trial medication supply from iGen. His employer (King's College London) has registered intellectual property on a novel buccal naloxone formulation with which JS is involved. JS has also been named in a patent registration by a Pharma company as inventor of a concentrated nasal naloxone spray.
