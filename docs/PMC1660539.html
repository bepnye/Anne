This was due to the fact that a substantial number of patients in the splint group received surgery after their treatment with a wrist splint. Furthermore, in the Netherlands the cost of open carpal tunnel release surgery is even lower than the cost of a wrist splint. These two facts contributed to lower direct health care costs in the surgery group. Some patients in the splint group received a custom-made splint, and others a prefabricated splint. The cost of a visit to the person who makes the custom-made splint or provides the prefabricated splint was calculated to be the same as a visit to a medical specialist.

In the Netherlands the standard tariff for an intervention is increased with a percentage that varies according to the specialism of the surgeon (i.e. general surgeon 24.5%, neurosurgeon 43.5%).

Consequently, the outcome measures are decisive which treatment option should be given to patients with CTS. This randomized controlled trial with an economic evaluation showed that, compared to splinting, surgery had better clinical effects and there were no difference in the costs. Therefore, on the basis of the results of this study, surgery is clearly the superior method of treatment for patients with CTS. This is not in line with the recommendation of The American Academy of Neurology that advises treatment of CTS with non-invasive options (e.g. splinting) initially, and OCTR only if non-invasive treatment proves to be ineffective [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="26734" xml_f="26736" txt_i="20273" txt_f="20275">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26743" xml_f="26745" txt_i="20275" txt_f="20277">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26752" xml_f="28233" txt_i="20278" txt_f="21759">A limitation of this study is that the results may be limited in how they can be applied to other countries in which the costs of surgery would be much higher. As surgery is much more expensive in other countries than in the Netherlands, results of this study may not be directly extrapolated. It is important to realize that the costs used in an economic evaluation are the real costs of the intervention and not the price that is paid by either the (public or private) health insurers and/or the patients. Not the prices charged for this intervention, but the real cost price should be included as the costs of the intervention in the economic evaluation. The real cost price is based on personnel, material and overhead costs. This intervention is a simple outpatient intervention, the surgeon and nurse don't spend more than 10–15 minutes to perform the intervention, and material costs are low. Assuming a salary of Euro 200 per hour for the surgeon and 50 for the nurse, the total personnel costs would be Euro 250/4 (assuming 15 minutes per intervention), which equals Euro 62.50. So, the tariff of Euro 69.50 we used seems a good proxy for the real cost price. The prices charged for this intervention in other countries are much higher than the actual cost price, which indicates that profits are (very) high. Economic evaluations in other health care systems (countries) are recommended, and these economic evaluations should also use the real cost price and not charges.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28255" xml_f="28265" txt_i="21761" txt_f="21771">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28276" xml_f="28427" txt_i="21772" txt_f="21923">In the Netherlands, surgery is more cost-effective compared with splinting, and recommended as the preferred method of treatment for patients with CTS.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28449" xml_f="28468" txt_i="21925" txt_f="21944">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28479" xml_f="28539" txt_i="21945" txt_f="22005">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28561" xml_f="28583" txt_i="22007" txt_f="22029">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28594" xml_f="28884" txt_i="22030" txt_f="22320">MvT, MR, HdV and LB were responsible for conception and design of the study.
