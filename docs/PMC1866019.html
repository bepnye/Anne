We assessed esomeprazole for maintaining long-term relief of such symptoms. Six hundred and ten patients with a chronic condition requiring anti-inflammatory therapy who achieved relief of NSAID-associated symptoms of pain, discomfort, or burning in the upper abdomen during two previous studies were enrolled and randomly assigned into two identical, multicentre, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies of esomeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg treatment (NASA2 [Nexium Anti-inflammatory Symptom Amelioration] and SPACE2 [Symptom Prevention by Acid Control with Esomeprazole] studies; ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT00241514 and NCT00241553, respectively) performed at various rheumatology, gastroenterology, and primary care clinics. Four hundred and twenty-six patients completed the 6-month treatment period. The primary measure was the proportion of patients with relapse of upper GI symptoms, recorded in daily diary cards, after 6 months. Relapse was defined as moderate-to-severe upper GI symptoms (a score of more than or equal to 3 on a 7-grade scale) for 3 days or more in any 7-day period. Esomeprazole was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining relief of upper GI symptoms throughout 6 months of treatment. Life-table estimates (95% confidence intervals) of the proportion of patients with relapse at 6 months (pooled population) were placebo, 39.1% (32.2% to 46.0%); esomeprazole 20 mg, 29.3% (22.3% to 36.2%) (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="6399" xml_f="6401" txt_i="1649" txt_f="1651">p </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="6410" xml_f="6483" txt_i="1651" txt_f="1724">= 0.006 versus placebo); and esomeprazole 40 mg, 26.1% (19.4% to 32.9%) (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="6491" xml_f="6493" txt_i="1724" txt_f="1726">p </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="6502" xml_f="6826" txt_i="1726" txt_f="2050">= 0.001 versus placebo).

The proportion of patients compliant with study drug (mean dosing: 75% to 125% relative to protocol) was more than 90% in all three treatment arms. Patient compliance with NSAID treatment (drugs used on at least 70% of days according to diary data) was similarly high (more than 90% of patients) in the three treatment arms in both studies. The diary card measurements demonstrated good reliability; the estimated correlation coefficient for the mean of 7 days of measurements (using GSRS abdominal pain score) was 0.62. Furthermore, the correlation between GSRS abdominal pain and the mean diary card measurements for the preceding 7 days ranged from 0.52 to 0.74 for the baseline values, last values, and change from baseline, indicating satisfactory validity.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19932" xml_f="19940" txt_i="14000" txt_f="14008">Efficacy</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19951" xml_f="20148" txt_i="14009" txt_f="14206">Significantly fewer patients on esomeprazole 20 or 40 mg, compared with placebo, experienced relapse of upper GI symptoms (upper abdominal pain, discomfort, or burning) based on diary data (Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"><offsets xml_i="20178" xml_f="20180" txt_i="14206" txt_f="14208">2a</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20187" xml_f="20393" txt_i="14208" txt_f="14414">).

First, patients were re-randomised from the acute studies even if their initial response had been to placebo, and this may have impacted on the study findings. For example, it appeared that patients taking placebo during the acute studies had a low relapse rate even when taking placebo during the maintenance phase; this is consistent with a true placebo response. In theory, the higher relapse rates in patients initially treated with esomeprazole who then received placebo during the maintenance phase could be attributed to acid rebound. However, it is difficult to distinguish between acid rebound and recurrence of initial symptoms, the latter of which seems more likely. Most of the benefits of acid suppression were established by day 45 (because most cases of symptom relapse in placebo recipients had already occurred by this time point). It is unknown whether those taking esomeprazole during the maintenance phase would require continued therapy beyond the 6-month time point in order to achieve sustained benefits. However, taking the two phases of this study as a whole, it seems likely that a substantial proportion of patients would experience relapse of symptoms if treatment were stopped at this point. In practice, prescribers may well assess the need for continued maintenance treatment by a trial of drug cessation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27486" xml_f="27982" txt_i="20760" txt_f="21256">In the two studies described here and the two 4-week studies that preceded them, NSAID-associated upper GI symptoms were strictly defined so as to differentiate them from symptoms more characteristic of GERD, primarily heartburn.
