All three devices showed high mastery (&gt;95%) in step 3. The most common error reported with Spiromax was related to the orientation of the device. Not shaking the device was the most common error with Easyhaler. Errors in priming the device were the most common with Turbuhaler. Spiromax, Easyhaler and Turbuhaler were rated as the ‘easiest device to use’ by 73.1%, 12.6% and 14.3% of participants, respectively.

The superiority in device mastery with Spiromax over Easyhaler and Turbuhaler was maintained in step 2 (p&lt;0.001). Inhaler technique mastery was better using Turbuhaler compared with Easyhaler in steps 1 and 2. In step 3, when participants were trained on how to use each of the inhaler devices by an HCP, almost all participants (&gt;95%) were able to use the inhaler devices correctly. No significant differences between the three devices were reported in step 3. Two independent studies are currently investigating device mastery for Spiromax compared with Turbuhaler among HCPs (in Australia) and patients with asthma (in the UK). Outcomes from the study presented here are similar to results reported in the device mastery study among Australian HCPs. More HCP participants achieved device mastery with Spiromax prior to training or after reading the PIL compared with Turbuhaler.</offsets><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="30677" xml_f="30679" txt_i="19860" txt_f="19862">17</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="30693" xml_f="30943" txt_i="19863" txt_f="20113">The improvement of device mastery in response to training highlights the importance of face-to-face training of participants at clinical visits.

Also, two of the participants held the device in a horizontal position. Per the inclusion criteria, participants were healthy individuals, inhaler-naïve and inhaler training-naïve. As such, this error could be related to participants not being familiar with the shapes of inhalers, whereas patients would probably be less likely to hold an inhaler in the horizontal position.

Although Spiromax needs to be held in the upright position during the preparation manoeuvre (while opening the cap of the inhaler device for dose preparation), the finding from a recent study that assessed the dose consistency delivered with Spiromax when the device is held at different orientations revealed that dose consistency is maintained when the inhaler is held at a + or −90° orientation.</offsets><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34060" xml_f="34062" txt_i="22938" txt_f="22940">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34069" xml_f="34410" txt_i="22940" txt_f="23281"> As such, the orientation error reported in this study with Spiromax might not be considered a critical error/error that could affect drug dose delivery to the lungs.

A surprisingly large proportion of participants (41.7%) were observed making handling errors even after reading the PIL with Easyhaler (compared with &lt;10% of participants when using Spiromax or Turbuhaler). The high number of errors in step 2 with Easyhaler might be linked to some ambiguities in the Swedish language of the PIL. For example, one of the Swedish PIL instructions is: “skaka upp och ned”, which translates to: “shake the device up and down”, and the following instruction is: “se till att du skakar den upp och ner”, which, coming straight after the first instruction, could translate as: “make sure you shake the device holding it upside down”. This is different to the English version of the PIL in which the instructions are: “shake the Easyhaler vigorously up and down three to five times, to allow proper powder flow and a correct dose. After shaking, hold the Easyhaler in the upright position”.</offsets><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="35557" xml_f="35559" txt_i="24387" txt_f="24389">16</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="35573" xml_f="35883" txt_i="24390" txt_f="24700">The most common handling errors with the Turbuhaler were also during the preparation of the device.

The higher levels of device mastery achieved with Spiromax, combined with the ease of use of the device, could potentially improve adherence, leading to improved asthma control and potentially reducing treatment costs.
