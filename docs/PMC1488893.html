Newer drugs, such as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), have been used extensively in Southeast Asia. Artemether–lumefantrine (an ACT) has now been adopted as first-line malaria treatment in Uganda, with the combination of amodiaquine and artesunate as a backup treatment. There are two ways that successful treatment is measured; first by whether the treatment works in curing the infection; and second by whether it prevents the disease recurring—either the same infection (known as recrudescence), or a new infection. The researchers wanted to look at how artemether–lumefantrine compared with amodiaquine and artesunate for treating symptomatic malaria, and also at whether there were any differences in recurrence, either of clinical malaria, or of parasite infection without symptoms, for 28 days after treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8599" xml_f="8600" txt_i="3295" txt_f="3296">

The researchers found that artemether–lumefantrine was more effective at reducing the risk and delayed the time to recurrence of malaria, compared with amodiaquine and artesunate. Additionally, treatment with artemether–lumefantrine resulted in a reduced rate of parasite infection without malaria symptoms, as compared with amodiaquine and artesunate. Nearly all cases of recurrent malaria after either treatment combination arose from new infections, rather than from recrudescences.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9352" xml_f="9353" txt_i="4029" txt_f="4030">

However, patients were only followed up for 28 days after treatment. A longer follow-up period might have revealed a higher rate of recurrence of malaria after treatment. In the trial, artemether–lumefantrine was not administered with food, and it's known that lumefantrine is absorbed better when it is taken with a small amount of fat. It's possible that the effect of artemether–lumefantrine seen in the trial could have been an underestimate of what might be achieved in ideal conditions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10071" xml_f="10072" txt_i="4729" txt_f="4730">

The results are consistent with those of other trials on the efficacy of ACTs that have been performed in the region. The study also adds data on the risk of recurrent infections in an area where malaria occurs very frequently. Even following treatment with either ACT, the risk of recurrence was very high.</offsets></p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"></page-count></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Bukirwa H, Yeka A, Kamya MR, Talisuna A, Banek K, et al.

In our study, participants received quinine as second-line treatment. However it is unclear whether quinine, the same ACT, or a different ACT would be the optimal treatment. Given that nearly all recurrent parasitemias were due to new infections, it may be reasonable to retreat with the same ACT regimen, rather than with quinine. Our results also indicate that integration of approaches to control malaria is essential. In an area of South Africa with lower-intensity transmission, the combination of vector control measures and provision of artemether–lumefantrine dramatically decreased the malaria burden [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010007-b019" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36057" xml_f="36059" txt_i="26628" txt_f="26630">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36066" xml_f="36278" txt_i="26630" txt_f="26842">].

As ACT use becomes widespread in areas with high levels of malaria transmission, it will be important to monitor closely for the selection of parasites that are resistant to artemisinin partner drugs.

Although malaria transmission occurs year-round in Tororo, the difference in transmission between dry and wet seasons had a substantial impact on risk of new infection, and therefore on the need for retreatment. The seasonal variation is important to recognize when comparing results of drug efficacy studies conducted at the same site. More broadly, these results highlight the importance of the level of transmission in determining risks of recurrent malaria after therapy. In a prior drug efficacy study conducted at the same site between September 2003 and March 2004, the unadjusted risk of recurrent infection at 28 days was 74% for amodiaquine + artesunate versus 59% for amodiaquine + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, with 12% versus 18% risk of recrudescence, respectively [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010007-b010" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="38945" xml_f="38947" txt_i="28953" txt_f="28955">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38954" xml_f="40103" txt_i="28955" txt_f="30104">]. For amodiaquine + artesunate, the difference between the past results and those reported here is likely due to seasonal and/or annual variation (impacting on risk of recurrent parasitemia), as well as slight differences in genotyping techniques (impacting on risk of recrudescence). In the prior study, genotyping was performed by analyzing for polymorphisms in MSP-2 only. In this study, the genotyping technique was refined by analyzing all samples initially identified as recrudescent by MSP-2 analysis for polymorphisms in MSP-1. Using this refined technique, the majority of samples initially classified as recrudescent were reclassified as new infections. Amodiaquine + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was not included in this study and thus cannot be directly compared to artemether–lumefantrine. However, the risks of recurrent parasitemia for amodiaquine + artesunate versus amodiaquine + sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine in the prior study (74% versus 59%, risk difference 15%, 95% CI 5%–25%) were similar to those for amodiaquine + artesunate versus artemether–lumefantrine in the current study (66% versus 51%, risk difference 16%, 95% CI 6%–25%).</offsets></p><table-wrap id="pctr-0010007-t003" content-type="2col" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="40186" xml_f="40193" txt_i="30105" txt_f="30112">Table 3</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="40217" xml_f="40235" txt_i="30112" txt_f="30130">Secondary Outcomes</offsets></title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pctr.0010007.t003"></graphic></table-wrap><fig id="pctr-0010007-g002" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="40368" xml_f="40376" txt_i="30131" txt_f="30139">Figure 2</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="40400" xml_f="40475" txt_i="30139" txt_f="30214">Day of Recurrent Malaria due to New Infection Stratified by Treatment Group</offsets></title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pctr.0010007.g002"></graphic></fig></sec><sec id="s4c"><title><offsets xml_i="40576" xml_f="40592" txt_i="30216" txt_f="30232">Overall Evidence</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40603" xml_f="40829" txt_i="30233" txt_f="30459">A systematic review of the six-dose regimen of artemether–lumefantrine published in 2005 identified nine randomized controlled trials, including four studies conducted in Africa (in Burundi, The Gambia, Tanzania, and Uganda) [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010007-b014" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="40875" xml_f="40877" txt_i="30459" txt_f="30461">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40884" xml_f="40885" txt_i="30461" txt_f="30462">,</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010007-b016" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="40931" xml_f="40933" txt_i="30462" txt_f="30464">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40940" xml_f="40941" txt_i="30464" txt_f="30465">,</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010007-b023" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="40987" xml_f="40989" txt_i="30465" txt_f="30467">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40996" xml_f="40997" txt_i="30467" txt_f="30468">–</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010007-b025" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="41043" xml_f="41045" txt_i="30468" txt_f="30470">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41052" xml_f="41519" txt_i="30470" txt_f="30937">].

We found that amodiaquine + artesunate and artemether–lumefantrine were both highly efficacious, but each regimen has limitations. The lifespan of amodiaquine + artesunate may be limited by resistance to amodiaquine, and the current lack of co-formulation of this regimen may reduce adherence, although a co-formulated combination may be available soon. Both regimens are much more expensive than older antimalarial drugs, and their widespread use in Africa has been challenged by limited availability. For both ACT regimens, the high rate of re-infection and the implications of frequent retreatment is a major concern. Artemisinin combination therapy offers an important step forward for the treatment of malaria in Africa, but continued research into effective, safe, and affordable antimalarial regimens, consideration of the comparative post-treatment effects of different therapies, and integration of treatment with preventive methods, will be necessary to establish effective and sustainable malaria control policies.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title><offsets xml_i="44459" xml_f="44481" txt_i="33350" txt_f="33372">SUPPORTING INFORMATION</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010007-sd001"><label><offsets xml_i="44570" xml_f="44587" txt_i="33373" txt_f="33390">CONSORT Checklist</offsets></label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010007.sd001.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="44650" xml_f="44686" txt_i="33390" txt_f="33426">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media><p><offsets xml_i="44711" xml_f="44723" txt_i="33427" txt_f="33439">(51 KB DOC).</offsets></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010007-sd002"><label><offsets xml_i="44833" xml_f="44847" txt_i="33440" txt_f="33454">Trial Protocol</offsets></label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010007.sd002.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="44910" xml_f="44946" txt_i="33454" txt_f="33490">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media><p><offsets xml_i="44971" xml_f="44984" txt_i="33491" txt_f="33504">(821 KB DOC).</offsets></p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="ack1"><title></title><p>We thank the clinical study team of Joanita Nankabirwa, Joy Bossa, Grace Musiimenta, Oswald Byaruhanga, Fred Kizito, Dorothy Kirunda, Nelson Budaka, and Sam Nsobya.
