The codes were then grouped according to their properties and types into categories and overarching themes. Relationships between different ideas began to emerge and were written as memos.

Both of these were key components of the BETTER Trial. We describe a new approach to integrated continuity that resulted in improved integration of CDPS into the practice. This was made possible through the continuity of the PP’s relationships with the patient, the physician and other members of the practice, and making links between internal and external CPDS resources and activities. This was how coordination was improved and how other clinicians in the practice became engaged in facilitating patients’ CDPS goals.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45131" xml_f="45665" txt_i="30186" txt_f="30720">Further work is needed to determine if the BETTER approach can be adapted to other settings and should include patient perspectives.
