Although stress-related sick leave imposes a significant burden on individuals and economies, few evidence-based therapies exist to prevent sick leave in people who are experiencing stress-related mental health problems. The researchers carrying out this study wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention for stress-related mental health disorders amongst people who had been on sick leave for less than three months. The intervention involved short training sessions for primary health-care practitioners, during which the practitioners were taught how to diagnose stress-related problems; how to provide information to patients and encourage their recovery and active return to work; and how to give advice and monitor patients' recovery. The researchers carried out a cluster-randomized trial evaluating this training program, in which 46 primary care practitioners were assigned by chance to receive either the training program or to practice usual care. Over the course of the trial, 433 patients with elevated levels of distress and sick leave were included in the study, 227 of whom were treated by practitioners receiving the training program and 206 of whom received usual care. These patients were followed up for 12 months and the primary outcome studied in the trial was the length of sick leave taken until full return to work. Secondary outcome measures included patients' reports of distress, depression, and other symptoms as recorded using specific questionnaires.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8824" xml_f="8825" txt_i="3515" txt_f="3516">

When these outcomes were analyzed, there was no evidence of a benefit of the training program on amount of sick leave taken. Over the course of the study, the severity of patients' self-reported symptoms fell in both groups, but there was no significant difference in symptom severity between the two groups of patients. A subgroup analysis suggested that more practitioners in the intervention group recognized patients as having stress-related mental health problems. Among the group of patients who were diagnosed as having stress-related mental health problems, those who were treated by practitioners in the intervention group seemed to return to work slightly more quickly than those in the usual care group. However, it is not easy to interpret the findings of this secondary analysis.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9854" xml_f="9855" txt_i="4526" txt_f="4527">

This process ensures that only patients assigned to the intervention arm receive the benefits of the intervention, and avoids “contamination” between intervention and control groups. A further strength includes the blinding of researchers who were collecting data to the intervention that each practitioner had received. The findings of the study, however, are difficult to interpret. No effect of the training intervention was found on the study's primary outcome measure; it is possible that the training intervention does indeed have some benefit, but the benefit may not have been found in this particular trial because of the inclusion of patients with a very wide range of problems; in addition the practitioners may have not had the time or ability to apply what they learnt in the training program.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10857" xml_f="10858" txt_i="5510" txt_f="5511">

The findings of this trial support those of another study carried out in a primary care setting, which found that training interventions do not seem to reduce length of sick leave. However, another study carried out in an occupational health-care setting, in which patients included in the trial had been recognised as having stress-related mental disorders, did find some benefit of an intervention program.</offsets></p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"></page-count></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Bakker IM, Terluin B, van Marwijk HWJ, van der Windt DAWM, Rijmen F, et al.

Symptoms of SMD were measured by means of self-reported levels of distress (e.g., worrying, listlessness, feeling tense—see </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0020026-g002"><offsets xml_i="17769" xml_f="17777" txt_i="10091" txt_f="10099">Figure 2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17784" xml_f="18748" txt_i="10099" txt_f="11063">) in order to recruit patients. We approached the source population every one or two weeks, until a sufficient number of patients from a particular PCP were enrolled. Final recruitment took place by phone survey. All patients who had returned the questionnaire and screened positive on distress and sick leave were contacted. Next, the inclusion criteria on distress and sick leave for no longer than three months were checked again. Since there are no diagnostic criteria, we did not attempt to make a diagnosis of SMD. If positive, patients were asked for their informed consent to be included in the study and to have their data collected and analysed. If the patient consented, the telephonic baseline interview was started. This method of recruitment, unaffected by the PCPs' diagnostic or therapeutic behaviour, ensured that the recruited patients included in the intervention and control groups were comparable, and at least not subjected to selection bias.</offsets></p><fig id="pctr-0020026-g001" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="18804" xml_f="18812" txt_i="11064" txt_f="11072">Figure 1</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="18836" xml_f="18853" txt_i="11072" txt_f="11089">CONSORT Flowchart</offsets></title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pctr.0020026.g001"></graphic></fig><fig id="pctr-0020026-g002" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="18979" xml_f="18987" txt_i="11090" txt_f="11098">Figure 2</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="19011" xml_f="19027" txt_i="11098" txt_f="11114">Patient Screener</offsets></title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pctr.0020026.g002"></graphic></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><offsets xml_i="19128" xml_f="19141" txt_i="11116" txt_f="11129">Interventions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19152" xml_f="20040" txt_i="11130" txt_f="12018">Over a period of 6–10 wk, the PCPs randomised into the intervention group received training in the Minimal Intervention for Stress-related mental disorders with Sick leave (MISS).

Independently, a randomly ordered list of codes (1 = MISS, 2 = UC) was generated. These lists were brought together and the first PCP on the list was allocated to the group indicated by the first code, and so on. As a result, 24 PCPs were allocated to the MISS group and 22 to the UC group. After the PCPs were assigned and the MISS group had received 7 h of training, the patients were enrolled by screening the source population. Patient selection was performed by the research team, in order to prevent selection bias due to the MISS training. The PCPs entered the names and addresses of the source population, and the source population was given the inclusion criteria through a screening questionnaire. The research assistance team contacted the patients who returned the questionnaire by phone, gave information about the study, and was responsible for the final recruitment. The internal research team, responsible for the process of data collection, knew the study involved was a randomised controlled trial, but they had no information on which PCP was allocated to what condition. Patients and external interviewers were blinded.

Possible explanations for the failure to find an effect can be sought within the patients, the PCPs, and the intervention used. First of all, we shall discuss the patients. There might have been a problem with the inclusion criteria used. It is possible that we misclassified a substantial part of the patients because our criteria might have been much too broad at both sides of the severity continuum. As can be seen with the self-reported symptoms of depression, 24.0% in the MISS group and 28.8% in the UC group still scored above threshold level after one year. This substantial group of patients may have had conditions that were of a more chronic nature (e.g., depressive disorder) and needed more extensive care. The difficulty here is that relevant dimensions of psychopathology that are subacute, but not yet chronic, and clearly related to stress (e.g., SMD), could not be distinguished in a straightforward way from more severe psychopathology or from an admixture of somatic and psychological symptoms. Nevertheless, we used only three questions on distress symptoms and one question on sick leave to recruit patients who had visited their PCP. We were convinced of the importance of undertaking this study, and for that reason might have underestimated the challenge of diagnosing SMDs. Thus, it is clear that the evidence base on criteria for the diagnosis of SMD in patients has to grow substantially.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38058" xml_f="38767" txt_i="27383" txt_f="28092">Furthermore, the lack of effect might be due to the PCPs. They are the gatekeepers of health care and have extensive workloads. The MISS takes into account the time constraints under which a PCP works, as well as the position of a PCP as a generalist who does not have the capacity to apply highly specialised interventions. Nevertheless, the PCPs may have been too busy to carry out any intervention at all. Alternatively, the intervention might have been too minimal, or the training hours too short for the PCPs to actually learn the necessary skills. Unfortunately, except for detection and labelling of symptoms, the extent to which the PCPs actually applied their skills was not addressed in this study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38774" xml_f="39706" txt_i="28093" txt_f="29025">Ancillary analyses showed there was an interaction between the intervention and detection of SMDs, other mental health problems, or somatic problems. Both SMDs and other mental health problems were more frequently diagnosed by the PCPs in the MISS group than by the PCPs in the UC group. Since, as a result of the training, the MISS PCPs were more sensitive to mental disorders and more keen to diagnose SMDs in particular, it seems logical to expect that this result would be biased. It seems likely that the SMD patients in the MISS group were significantly less severely affected than the SMD patients in the UC group. This in turn could have caused differences in outcome of the SMD patients in the study group, giving a false (confounded) impression of the effect of the MISS. However, the SMD patients in the MISS group actually turned out to have higher baseline levels of symptoms than the SMD patients in the UC group (see </offsets><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pctr-0020026-st001"><offsets xml_i="39771" xml_f="39779" txt_i="29025" txt_f="29033">Table S1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39786" xml_f="40265" txt_i="29033" txt_f="29512">). We tested baseline variables for confounding and as a result controlled for severity of symptoms, but that did not make the effect of the intervention in the SMD patients disappear. Nevertheless, it should be noted that this was an ancillary analysis, and because of the selection of the SMD patients by the PCPs' diagnosis, although it was a preplanned subgroup analysis, in no case can this result be regarded as evidence of a difference between the MISS group and UC group.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title><offsets xml_i="40296" xml_f="40312" txt_i="29514" txt_f="29530">Generalisability</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40323" xml_f="40728" txt_i="29531" txt_f="29936">We carried out a randomised controlled trial with only a few exclusion criteria and thereby allowed considerable variation due to context, diagnosis, and treatment, so flattering performances or overestimation of application are unlikely to be issues.

In that trial, social workers were trained to apply the intervention, while PCPs provided UC for patients in the other group. The study found no differences between the conditions. Return-to-work rates after three months were 37% in the intervention group and 40% in the UC group. The more favourable outcomes of this study seem to indicate that the occupational setting may be exceptional, and that the results may not equally apply to primary care. Moreover, our trial addressed a wider range of patients than the trial of van der Klink et al., who excluded patients with major depression or anxiety. The more beneficial effects of the MISS among patients with a PCP's diagnosis of SMD may indicate that these patients more strongly resemble the participants in the occupational study.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title><offsets xml_i="42392" xml_f="42403" txt_i="31392" txt_f="31403">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42414" xml_f="43485" txt_i="31404" txt_f="32475">This project represents a further step in the development of an evidence-based intervention for the treatment of distressed patients on sick leave.

In subgroup analyses a possible direction for further research was identified: namely, whether patients diagnosed with SMDs may benefit from an effect of the MISS on duration of sick leave. We feel that emphasis on functional rehabilitation of the patient is important, because continuation of sick leave may lead to chronicity and deterioration of symptoms. Unfortunately, diagnosis of SMD in primary health care turns out to be less straightforward than we expected, and the evidence base on criteria for this diagnosis will need to grow substantially before definite conclusions can be drawn.
