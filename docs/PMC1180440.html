A well run tutorial is stimulating and involves frequent participation from all members within the class in a non-threatening environment. Perhaps the main advantage of a small class size is the ability to incorporate a number of active learning strategies. The inclusion of discussion methods can lead to improved student performance [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="5103" xml_f="5104" txt_i="1602" txt_f="1603">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5111" xml_f="5112" txt_i="1603" txt_f="1604">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="5143" xml_f="5144" txt_i="1604" txt_f="1605">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5151" xml_f="5247" txt_i="1605" txt_f="1701">], particularly when considering retention of knowledge, critical thinking and problem solving [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="5278" xml_f="5279" txt_i="1701" txt_f="1702">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5286" xml_f="5598" txt_i="1702" txt_f="2014">]. Unfortunately, it is a common observation that tutors tend to use the same teaching methods whether they are delivering lectures or running tutorials.

The style and attitude of the tutor is critical and those who seek to engage their group in a non-threatening manner are more likely to be rewarded by increased group participation. The larger the group, the more difficult will be the engagement. This is partly because of the difficulty in involving many people in one discussion, but also the reluctance of individuals to potentially be embarrassed in front of their peers. Students need to feel that they can trust the tutor and their fellow students before they will contribute [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="6223" xml_f="6224" txt_i="2602" txt_f="2603">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6231" xml_f="6373" txt_i="2603" txt_f="2745">].

Audience members, students in this case, push one or more of these buttons in response to a question posed by the tutor.

All of the students were in the age range 21â23 and had completed three years of a six-year undergraduate medicine programme. This was their first year of clinical experience. All students in the study came from one academic year and represented 93% of the students in that year. The students were randomly allocated into one of six groups and stratified for gender and academic ability (i.e. previous academic performance in the medical course). The randomisation was carried out by the secretariat in the medical school, who had no connection with the study. In order to verify that this randomisation had been carried out effectively, a one-way ANOVA was used to look for differences between groups in the areas of gender and academic ability. Academic ability was measured using the previous years exam results.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8841" xml_f="9547" txt_i="5064" txt_f="5770">The study was carried out at six different times during the year as groups of 13â21 students rotated through the surgical component of their year. It consisted of a pre-test evaluation of the students' prior knowledge and understanding of two topics followed by a tutorial on each topic. At the end of each tutorial there was a post-test evaluation and a questionnaire. Six weeks after the tutorials, the post-test evaluation was repeated. The tests for each topic had two components; a knowledge test of 11 multiple-choice questions and two multi-stage problem-solving questions designed to measure understanding.

The introduction of the EVS dramatically reduced the number of student-lecturer interactions.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label><offsets xml_i="17032" xml_f="17039" txt_i="12584" txt_f="12591">Table 2</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="17059" xml_f="17113" txt_i="12591" txt_f="12645">Summary of student tutorial dynamics, shown as medians</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17201" xml_f="17207" txt_i="12647" txt_f="12653">No EVS</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17229" xml_f="17232" txt_i="12654" txt_f="12657">EVS</offsets></td><td></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17287" xml_f="17316" txt_i="12659" txt_f="12688">Time Spent per Case (minutes)</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17338" xml_f="17340" txt_i="12689" txt_f="12691">15</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17362" xml_f="17364" txt_i="12692" txt_f="12694">15</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17386" xml_f="17388" txt_i="12695" txt_f="12697">ns</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17419" xml_f="17446" txt_i="12698" txt_f="12725">Students Participating/case</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17468" xml_f="17470" txt_i="12726" txt_f="12728">12</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17492" xml_f="17494" txt_i="12729" txt_f="12731">10</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17516" xml_f="17524" txt_i="12732" txt_f="12740">p = 0.02</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17555" xml_f="17573" txt_i="12741" txt_f="12759">Total Writing/case</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17595" xml_f="17597" txt_i="12760" txt_f="12762">10</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17619" xml_f="17620" txt_i="12763" txt_f="12764">2</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17642" xml_f="17651" txt_i="12765" txt_f="12774">p = 0.006</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17682" xml_f="17717" txt_i="12775" txt_f="12810">No. Different Students Writing/case</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17739" xml_f="17740" txt_i="12811" txt_f="12812">5</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17762" xml_f="17763" txt_i="12813" txt_f="12814">2</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17785" xml_f="17794" txt_i="12815" txt_f="12824">p = 0.006</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17825" xml_f="17850" txt_i="12825" txt_f="12850">Level 1 Interactions/case</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17872" xml_f="17873" txt_i="12851" txt_f="12852">4</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17895" xml_f="17898" txt_i="12853" txt_f="12856">1.5</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17920" xml_f="17929" txt_i="12857" txt_f="12866">p = 0.003</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17960" xml_f="17985" txt_i="12867" txt_f="12892">Level 2 Interactions/case</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18007" xml_f="18010" txt_i="12893" txt_f="12896">7.5</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18032" xml_f="18033" txt_i="12897" txt_f="12898">1</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18055" xml_f="18068" txt_i="12899" txt_f="12909">p &lt; 0.0001</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18099" xml_f="18124" txt_i="12910" txt_f="12935">Level 3 Interactions/case</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18146" xml_f="18147" txt_i="12936" txt_f="12937">1</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18169" xml_f="18170" txt_i="12938" txt_f="12939">0</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18192" xml_f="18205" txt_i="12940" txt_f="12950">p &lt; 0.0001</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18236" xml_f="18269" txt_i="12951" txt_f="12984">Student-Student Interactions/case</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18291" xml_f="18292" txt_i="12985" txt_f="12986">3</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18314" xml_f="18315" txt_i="12987" txt_f="12988">5</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18337" xml_f="18339" txt_i="12989" txt_f="12991">ns</offsets></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18396" xml_f="18412" txt_i="12993" txt_f="13009">Test evaluations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18423" xml_f="18541" txt_i="13010" txt_f="13128">The gender and educational status had no confounding effect and were therefore excluded from the mixed model analysis.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18557" xml_f="18582" txt_i="13129" txt_f="13154">Multiple-choice questions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18593" xml_f="18839" txt_i="13155" txt_f="13398">There was a significant 3-way interaction between time, EVS usage and order (p &lt; 0.001) however it was not possible to find any effect consistent with the use of the EVS.

There was a significant improvement in scores both immediately after and six weeks after the tutorial, irrespective of whether the tutorial included the EVS or not for both tutorial topics. At pre-test for the topic of the acute abdomen, the students who had EVS for this topic had significantly different pre-test scores from those students who did not. This result is likely to be a type II error, as the students had not used the EVS at the time of the pre-test. It is possible that the discrepancy may be due to the reliability of the series of multiple-choice questions used (pre, post and 6 week), which ranged between 0.40 and 0.53. There was a significant difference in Post-Test scores between EVS and no EVS for the gastrointestinal subject, but in light of the unexplained discrepancy at the time of pre-testing, the authors cannot conclude that this represents a real effect. All other comparisons between groups yielded no significant differences regardless of order, nor was there any significant difference in retention (Immediate Post-Test scores subtracted from six Week Post-Test score) between students who had tutorials with and without EVS for both topics.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label><offsets xml_i="20106" xml_f="20113" txt_i="14579"

The theoretical advantages of an electronic voting system include increased audience participation by allowing anonymous decision-making and by providing immediate feedback to both student and tutor allowing misconceptions to be addressed at the moment they occur. The participants can then see the collective response and as a result may feel less inhibited when contributing to any forthcoming discussion. This could be a two-way process, making contact easier for more diffident tutors.

We have shown that the tutor's role had become secondary to the technology itself and that the type of participation the students had was altered to be more inclusive of fellow students and less inclusive of the tutor. This change in interaction provides advantages for both student and tutor, especially if either party struggles to interact with the other. It is quite possible that the addition of an electronic voting system to a tutorial with a more didactic and passive tutor may have shown objective benefit in short and long term knowledge and understanding of the tutorial subjects by the students.

If notes form a pivotal part of the learning process, then the reduced time spent writing was a disadvantage. If less time taking notes meant more concentration on the tutorial and more participation, this could be seen as advantageous. In this study, where there was no requirement for the students to study for any of the assessments, the role of notes being required for revision did not arise. If the EVS is used in tutorials included in formal assessment, it may well be desirable for notes to be provided to students to allow for later revision. The authors have noted previously (unpublished) that the presence of computer aided learning tools in a tutorial has been reported to increase note taking, so the introduction of the EVS may be acting as a balancing effect.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33529" xml_f="34105" txt_i="24496" txt_f="25072">The results of the test measurements in this study demonstrated that the addition of the EVS to the tutorial made no difference to the short term knowledge and understanding imparted but that there was a small increase in long-term retention of problem-solving skills.

One might expect any method, which provides regular stimulus in a class will be of benefit in terms of increasing the attention span of students. A tutorial is intended to provide a continuing intellectual challenge and it may be that the effects of additional teaching aids are lessened due to the nature of the teaching environment. Greater objective benefit may be derived from teaching aids when the class size is larger, or when the tutor is less able to interact with the students. This study was conducted in small group setting because it was planned to study one complete academic year. These students never met as a large class and therefore the only practical way of running the study was when the students were undertaking their six week surgical attachment and could be studied then in a block â albeit a relatively small one. In addition, there was only a limited amount of EVS equipment available â sufficient for 30 students. These are common types of constraints for any form of educational research. In order to test the usefulness of any educational intervention in a real learning situation, compromises are often required.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35653" xml_f="36773" txt_i="26530" txt_f="27650">This study had a number of strengths. First, we were able to enrol the students from a single year of the clinical course and thus ensured an appropriate spectrum of academic ability from a single cohort of students. Second, the study was able to determine clear end-points and apply both quantitative and qualitative measurement in a 'real' educational environment. A weak point â which was recognised when the study was designed and which was unavoidable â was that it would have to run over an entire academic year over six different groups of students and therefore required smaller groups than would be desirable in an ideal situation. The authors feel this may have reduced the impact of the introduction of the EVS. The risk of different groups of students starting with different baselines, depending on how far along the course they had progressed when they did the study was tested and found not to have any confounding effect on the results. Time constraints imposed on the study by the medical curriculum meant that the number of questions, which could be imposed in the testing phase were not quite optimal.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="36795" xml_f="36805" txt_i="27652" txt_f="27662">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36816" xml_f="37920" txt_i="27663" txt_f="28767">Teaching aids such as computers and electronic voting systems can be expensive to purchase and maintain.

If there are no tangible benefits from systems such as the one used in this study, funding might be better used on staff development. Despite this caveat, the future of immediate feedback response systems appears bright. This study has shown that electronic voting systems can provide a stimulating learning environment for students and in a small group tutorial may improve educational outcomes. The wired systems such as the one used in this study are rapidly being replaced by wireless equipment, which should be cheaper, easier to use and more versatile. The growing popularity of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and the expanding capabilities of mobile phones combined with the relative ease of using existing web-based technologies mean that the need for a dedicated response system is waning.
