The patients were aware that the interviewer (MW) was a GP working at one of the health care centres and that she was the principal investigator of the yoga RCT. In the sampling process, patients with a prior patient–doctor relationship to MW were removed from the selection process to avoid any potential conflict of loyalty that might prevent the patients from sharing negative experiences. However, six out of 13 patients had their yoga training (one single 30-min instruction session) from MW. This is a limitation of the study, which we could not prevent due to lack of resources. Considering the climate of the dialogue with the informants and that reporting of all kinds of experiences were encouraged and requested, we think that the under-reporting of negative experiences has been minimised. We did not find any difference in the willingness to report either negative or positive experiences of the yoga between patients that had been taught yoga by different instructors.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36991" xml_f="38095" txt_i="22054" txt_f="23158">We acknowledge the impact of our preconceptions, which most likely have influenced the collection and interpretation of data to some extent. As GPs, we might have certain expectations of the patients’ experiences of a disease. The use of multiple researchers (GPs and one behavioural scientist) in every step of the analysis process (triangulation) and the use of a known methodology improves the credibility of our results. We prepared the interview guide in advance to help keep an open mind and in order to include all aspects of the patients’ experiences. The guide had a reminder of the different topics that should be explored and also stated the approach of asking open-ended questions. To validate consecutively during the interview, the patients were asked whether their statements had been correctly perceived. In order to achieve this, the interviewer carried out regular summaries of the narrative throughout the interview period. The medical knowledge of MW can also be seen as an advantage, since a doctor may have a better understanding of expressions and situations linked to the disease.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38102" xml_f="38312" txt_i="23159" txt_f="23369">To enhance the dependability of the study, we have presented a clear description of the selection process, the data collection and data analysis process and we performed interviews until saturation was reached.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38319" xml_f="38516" txt_i="23370" txt_f="23567">A limitation of our study is that the results only reflect the experiences of yoga during and immediately after the yoga program.
