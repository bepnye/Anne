Internet-based cognitive behavioural treatment (ICBT) has been suggested for use in primary care and has been shown to be more effective when combined with human support. However, non-completion rates remain a challenge. Current recommendations state that steps to improve persistence with ICBT should be determined and the impact of therapist support on persistence explored. A few earlier studies have explored motivations to persist with ICBT without face-to-face therapist support. The present study explored the motivation to persist as experienced by a group of patients who sought help in primary care and used “blended care”, i.e. ICBT supported by short face-to-face consultations.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5139" xml_f="5146" txt_i="790" txt_f="797">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5157" xml_f="5643" txt_i="798" txt_f="1284">To elucidate motivation in an everyday context and the meaning of patients’ experiences we chose a phenomenological hermeneutical approach.

The feeling of being able to freely choose how, when and where to complete the ICBT modules was identified as an important supporting condition and satisfied the participants’ need for autonomy. Furthermore, the importance of a sense of belonging towards partners, friends or family was essential for motivation as was the ability to identify with ICBT content. Another supporting condition was the experience of connectedness when met with acknowledgement, flexibility and feedback from a qualified therapist in the face-to-face consultations.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6350" xml_f="6361" txt_i="1941" txt_f="1952">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6372" xml_f="6797" txt_i="1953" txt_f="2378">A key finding was that participants were motivated to persist with ICBT when their overall need for relatedness was satisfied.

Connectedness with the therapist and the participant’s ability to identify with the ICBT modules also gave a sense of relatedness. Improving these motivational aspects may increase patients’ persistence with ICBT.</offsets></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Internet-based cognitive behavioural treatment</kwd><kwd>Adherence</kwd><kwd>Self-determination theory</kwd><kwd>Motivation</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7060" xml_f="7070" txt_i="2387" txt_f="2397">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7081" xml_f="7187" txt_i="2398" txt_f="2504">Depression is highly prevalent, resulting in distress to patients and families and huge costs to society [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="7218" xml_f="7219" txt_i="2504" txt_f="2505">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7226" xml_f="7227" txt_i="2505" txt_f="2506">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="7258" xml_f="7259" txt_i="2506" txt_f="2507">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7266" xml_f="7334" txt_i="2507" txt_f="2575">].

According to SDT, three basic psychological needs should be satisfied in order to enhance intrinsic motivation: relatedness, competence and autonomy. Relatedness includes a sense of recognition, belonging with peers, family or community and a need to feel connected to and valued by important others. Competence involves socio-contextual success with optimal challenges, feedback and freedom from demeaning evaluation.

These attitudes pertain to individual patient experiences in contextual settings, rather than to motivation as a distinct quantifiable factor.

Our aim was to explore motivational aspects and an understanding of how the patients themselves have experienced to persist in treatment in an everyday context. By obtaining a narration of the patient’s own perspective and stories, motivation as lived experience could be explored and analysed. Also, with a phenomenological approach it was of great importance to try to set aside what we as researchers took for granted as facts and strive to listen and analyse without judgment, but concentrate on experience.

If blended care is implemented in general practice, patients may feel stress due to appointment time constraints and may fail to feel connected with the GP. It is also uncertain whether a GP or other ICBT provider in primary care can fill the shoes of being an expert during the process of change. Undertaking training in the delivering of blended ICBT may provide competence for such GPs.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="46526" xml_f="46551" txt_i="34493" txt_f="34518">Strengths and limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="46562" xml_f="46830" txt_i="34519" txt_f="34787">A methodological strength with this study was the use of in-depth interviews.

Depending on the situation, people in social interactions inhabit different role characters and statuses [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"><offsets xml_i="46862" xml_f="46864" txt_i="34787" txt_f="34789">37</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46871" xml_f="47561" txt_i="34789" txt_f="35479">]. In our study, both interviewers were first of all researchers, but they were also health professionals. The second author was a therapist in the RCT in which this study is situated, but never interviewed her own patients. We chose to be open about our double status, but did not inform our participants about her status as a therapist. We made it clear that our intention was not to defend the treatment, but to better understand the patients' thoughts and experiences. The intention was to open an honest and trusting dialogue. It was a strength that the experienced third author (MBR) continuously gave feedback on our interviews to ensure that quality and adequate depth was achieved.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47568" xml_f="47618" txt_i="35480" txt_f="35530">Participants entering RCTs are a selected sample [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"><offsets xml_i="47650" xml_f="47652" txt_i="35530" txt_f="35532">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47659" xml_f="48294" txt_i="35532" txt_f="36167">] and may therefore be more motivated. One strength of our study was that all participants had initially contacted their GP for their problems, which may reduce the selection bias. A limitation was that only three of our 14 participants were non-completers. Although non-completers were invited to be interviewed, many refused and thus could not be included in our study. Therefore our findings can only be seen as a partial description of the full range of patients. However, our main aim in this article was to explore the aspects of motivation to start and persist with ICBT, and accordingly a majority of completers was acceptable.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="48345" xml_f="48356" txt_i="36170" txt_f="36181">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48367" xml_f="48949" txt_i="36182" txt_f="36764">By analysing the interviews of our 14 participants, we attempted to understand motivation as experienced when using ICBT with short intermittent consultations. Intrinsic motivators such as gaining control of one’s life and a personal hope for recovery were identified. A key result was that patients were motivated to persist with ICBT when their need for relatedness was satisfied. This was achieved through feelings of self-identification with the ICBT programme and an experience of belonging and being valued by partners, friends and family and connectedness with the therapist.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="48965" xml_f="49003" txt_i="36765" txt_f="36803">Implications for research and practice</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49014" xml_f="49273" txt_i="36804" txt_f="37063">Enhancing motivation may be a step to improving therapeutic persistence.
