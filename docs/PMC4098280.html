Current guidelines for the treatment of patients with acute asthma have recommended the use of inhaled beta-agonists to reverse airflow obstruction. The optimal dose of albuterol for treatment of acute asthma has yet to be established. Most American references recommend a starting dose of 2.5 mg aerosolized albuterol every 20 min, while European authobities recommend higher doses.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="2820" xml_f="2830" txt_i="512" txt_f="522">Objectives</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="2841" xml_f="3011" txt_i="523" txt_f="693">The purpose of this study was to compare 2.5 mg with 7.5 mg nebulized albuterol for the treatment of acute asthma, using spirometric data and arterial blood gas sampling.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="3033" xml_f="3045" txt_i="695" txt_f="707">Study design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3056" xml_f="3097" txt_i="708" txt_f="749">A double-blind randomized clinical trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="3119" xml_f="3127" txt_i="751" txt_f="759">Subjects</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3138" xml_f="3272" txt_i="760" txt_f="894">We studied 106 patients older than 15 years who presented to the emergency department with moderate to severe acute asthmatic attacks.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="3313" xml_f="3320" txt_i="896" txt_f="903">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3331" xml_f="3843" txt_i="904" txt_f="1416">On enrolment, patients underwent baseline testing, including initial spirometory/peak flowmetry and arterial blood gas sampling. A standardized treatment algorithm was used for all patients so they received oxygen and corticosteroid and underwent cardiopulmonary monitoring. Patients then received in a randomized, double-blinded fashion, nebulized albuterol at a dose of either 2.5 or 7.5 mg over 20 min. Spirometry or peak flowetry and ABG sampling were repeated after treatment.
