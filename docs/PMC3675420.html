The use of innovative materials, such as biological meshes, is thought to be the most suitable treatment, due to their specific composition. The non-human collagen matrix can support tissue regeneration through neovascularization and fibroblastic cell repopulation leading to endogenous collagen formation. The exogenous collagen is then resorbed by collagenases. These biological meshes have two main properties: resistance to infection and mechanical resistance, which theoretically facilitate treatment of the infected incisional hernia

The use of biological meshes has expanded rapidly in recent years, despite a lack of substantial evidence and their high cost. No comparative trial is available at the present time, specifically for infected incisional hernias (grade 4 on the VHWG grading system). The most significant study was presented as a poster at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress in 2010, which included 80 patients in infected and contaminated fields; however, this was an observational, non-comparative study

A randomized, controlled trial, sponsored by industry, has been designed, comparing the biological mesh Tutomesh to fascia closure without mesh reinforcement in potentially contaminated fields (grade 3 on the VHWG grading system), but the results are still unknown.
