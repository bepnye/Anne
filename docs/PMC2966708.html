In the present study, both the laparoscopic and open surgical approaches caused an increased serum cortisol level. The similarity in the cortisol response between the two groups suggests that laparoscopic hysterectomy, despite the absence of a substantial abdominal incision, cause a significant stress response similar to that resulting from abdominal hysterectomy. The increased cortisol level following the laparoscopic surgical technique indicate that a considerable activation of the neuroendocrine response occurs after laparoscopic surgery despite the absence of a substantial skin incision. It also suggests that the main stimuli for promoting hormonal secretion are visceral and peritoneal afferent activities and not the stimuli arising from the abdominal wall. This was supported by the prompt fall of the serum cortisol level soon after peritoneal deflation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18811" xml_f="19278" txt_i="14024" txt_f="14491">In conclusion, our study demonstrated that laparoscopic hysterectomy did not greatly alter the classic neuroendocrine response, but laparoscopic hysterectomy is associated with a less intense inflammatory response compared with that of abdominal hysterectomy. Laparoscopic surgery is believed to lessen the surgical trauma and so it causes redcued disturbance of the physiologic function. This may all contribute to the rapid recovery after laparoscopic hysterectomy.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by the Institute of
