We enrolled patients with septic shock, elevated lactate (≥3 mmol/l) and no obvious competing cause of lactate elevation. Patients received thiamine 200 mg or placebo i.v. twice/day for 7 days. The primary outcome was lactate levels at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included the SOFA score at 24 hours and mortality. Lactate levels at 24 hours were compared between groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and categorical variables were compared using the Fisher's exact test. Lactate values at 24 hours, for those who died before 24 hours, were imputed according to a predefined plan. We performed a preplanned analysis in those with baseline thiamine deficiency (≤7 nmol/l).</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title><offsets xml_i="5654" xml_f="5661" txt_i="1116" txt_f="1123">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5672" xml_f="5955" txt_i="1124" txt_f="1407">We enrolled 88 patients; 43 received thiamine and 45 placebo.
