The eRegistry for Palestine is developed in the District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) tracker software, which is a flexible web-based open-source information system. All Palestinian residents have unique identifiers which makes it possible to track care and outcomes of women throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, irrespective of the healthcare facility level. In this setting, currently operating only with paper case notes, we aim to assess the effectiveness of an eRegistry’s interactive checklists and clinical decision support on improving the quality of care for pregnant women.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title><offsets xml_i="18950" xml_f="18960" txt_i="10169" txt_f="10179">Objectives</offsets></title><sec id="Sec4"><title><offsets xml_i="18990" xml_f="19008" txt_i="10180" txt_f="10198">Primary objectives</offsets></title><p id="Par22"><offsets xml_i="19030" xml_f="19307" txt_i="10199" txt_f="10476">To estimate the effectiveness of the eRegistry’s interactive checklists and clinical decision support on: 1) improving the provision of timely and appropriate screening and management for important conditions during ANC; and 2) health outcomes for the mothers and the newborns.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title><offsets xml_i="19339" xml_f="19359" txt_i="10478" txt_f="10498">Secondary objectives</offsets></title><p id="Par23"><offsets xml_i="19381" xml_f="19542" txt_i="10499" txt_f="10660">To estimate the effectiveness of the eRegistry’s interactive checklists and clinical decision support on: 1) timely ANC visits; and 2) occurrence of stillbirths.</offsets></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title><offsets xml_i="19615" xml_f="19622" txt_i="10664" txt_f="10671">Methods</offsets></title><sec id="Sec7"><title><offsets xml_i="19652" xml_f="19664" txt_i="10672" txt_f="10684">Trial design</offsets></title><p id="Par24"><offsets xml_i="19686" xml_f="20001" txt_i="10685" txt_f="11000">This cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) is a superiority trial with two parallel arms (intervention and control).

Risk assessments are conducted at the first ANC visit, and women identified with certain risk factors are referred for further management in so-called high-risk clinics.

Primary analyses will be according to intention-to-treat comparing control and intervention groups using individual-level data taking the design effect of the clustering into account. In addition, we will undertake a per-protocol analysis. A baseline table with summary measures for the following background characteristics of participants will be reported: maternal age, parity, average monthly household income, education, medical history, obstetrical history, body mass index, blood pressure at booking visit, hemoglobin at booking visit, urine stick results for glucose at booking visit, birth weight, and fetal presentation at term. We will first undertake a cluster-level analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes. We will then perform analyses on individual-level data. All primary outcomes of the study will be measured as proportions. Comparisons of categorical variables will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) with a log link. We will use two-sided statistical tests and 95% confidence intervals for descriptive statistics and effectiveness estimates. In order to take into account the inherent clustering in our trial design, we will use random effects models. The effect of the intervention on the risk and prevalence of outcomes will be reported as relative (risk ratios (RR) and prevalence ratios (PR)) and absolute (risk difference and prevalence difference) measures of effect. Effectiveness will be calculated as 100 × (1 – RR) and 100 × (1 – PR) as appropriate. We will consider adjusting for confounders if there are baseline imbalances in the trial arms for variables that are strongly associated with the primary outcomes. We will perform complete case analyses and consider appropriate imputations for missing data. We will employ spider graphs in order to graphically display the effect of the intervention and whether a disproportionately large part of the effect can be ascribed to extreme effects in a few large clusters. In the rare event of protocol violations such as withdrawal of the eRegistry from an intervention PHC, data from these clusters will be excluded for women enrolled from the time of violation and onwards. All data on the pregnant women who maintain allocation, irrespective of from which cluster they receive care, will be included in the analyses. For those women that switch from intervention to control PHC, they will be analyzed as randomized in the primary, intention-to-treat analyses. In the per-protocol analysis, only data prior to switching clinics will be used and the rest will be treated as missing data.

We will present additional analyses of quality of antenatal care measures in order to gain better understanding of the primary process (adherence) outcomes of the trial.

This CRCT aims to contribute to filling this evidence gap. In order to study effectiveness of the intervention in the health system, we have designed a pragmatic CRCT. We have worked closely with the Palestinian MoH to plan the intervention and the timelines for the implementation of the eRegistry. All our communication strategies to the study clinics have always been through the Palestinian MoH via established channels within the health system in an attempt to keep monitoring of sites robust but as close to real-world settings as possible. We have striven to maintain generalizability of study findings by including a large representative sample of PHC and having no individual-level eligibility criteria. Data for outcome measures are derived from existing data collection pathways for the eRegistry in Palestine. The design and implementation of this CRCT places emphasis on the outcomes, as well as the feasibility of their measurement, in registry settings within the health system. Loss to follow-up is expected to be minimal since all our data sources are part of the eRegistry. We have designed outcome measures to directly reflect the effect of the intervention within the setting of an electronic registry, justifying the use of secondary data, where the process outcomes are based on the care providers’ own documentation of process, and health outcome measures are based on data collected independently from the care provider.</offsets></p><p id="Par48"><offsets xml_i="55674" xml_f="56724" txt_i="41273" txt_f="42323">There are some limitations to the design of the CRCT. Pregnant women from intervention and control PHC are referred to the same high-risk clinics, where care providers use both paper records (for women referred from control PHC) and the eRegistry (for women referred from intervention PHC). This may lead to some contamination, which may underestimate the true effect of the intervention. About 5–10% of care providers in the study clinics work both in intervention and control PHC. This is another source of contamination that may potentially lead to effectiveness underestimation. Since the data for process outcomes is dependent on completeness of documentation by the care provider, there might be missing or incomplete data to inform some of the outcome indicators. We recognize that PHC location, activities, and staff are vulnerable to changes in public health planning and policy. We have tried to mitigate the risk of this affecting the study design by working closely with the Palestinian MoH and maintaining strong stakeholder involvement.</offsets></p><sec id="Sec31"><title><offsets xml_i="56751" xml_f="56763" txt_i="42324" txt_f="42336">Trial status</offsets></title><p id="Par49"><offsets xml_i="56785" xml_f="56833" txt_i="42337" txt_f="42385">The CRCT started recruitment on 15 January 2017.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="56895" xml_f="56911" txt_i="42388" txt_f="42404">Additional files</offsets></title><sec id="Sec32"><p><offsets xml_i="56938" xml_f="56939" txt_i="42405" txt_f="42406">
