However, 17-hydroxyprogesterone by itself is not active; it needs to be converted to testosterone for its clinical effects to manifest. Monitoring of androstenedione level is recommended by many experts. However, our resource limited environment does not allow routine monitoring of androstenedione. There are regimens in which late bed time dose of hydrocortisone is advocated over more conventional evening dose of hydrocortisone with the hope the bedtime dose will have greater suppressive effects on early morning serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone levels.[</offsets><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="21539" xml_f="21541" txt_i="16082" txt_f="16084">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21548" xml_f="22017" txt_i="16084" txt_f="16553">] However, currently there is no clear evidence to support this practice.

Again it was proved that evening replacement dose of prednisolone is no better than hydrocortisone. It has to be noted that the 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels were lower in the prednisolone group although it did not achieve statistical significance. Undesirable over suppression of 17 hydroxyprogesterone in 23% patients in the prednisolone group is probably indicative of the deleterious effects of prednisolone on long-term use. It is possible that larger sample size would have demonstrated a significant suppression of 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels with prednisolone treatment. Moreover most of the patients in this study belonged to the âclinically controlledâ group even prior to entry into study. It would be interesting to look at prior uncontrolled patients separately to see if one time short-term prednisolone is useful for achieving better disease control without overt growth suppression.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23519" xml_f="23702" txt_i="17922" txt_f="18105">It has been shown previously that the evening dose of hydrocortisone administered could not adequately suppress the early morning rise in adrenal androgens in many patients with CAH.[</offsets><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="23735" xml_f="23736" txt_i="18105" txt_f="18106">3</offsets></xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="23776" xml_f="23777" txt_i="18106" txt_f="18107">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23784" xml_f="23909" txt_i="18107" txt_f="18232">] In another study no significant difference was found between high morning and evening hydrocortisone in children with CAH.[</offsets><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="23943" xml_f="23945" txt_i="18232" txt_f="18234">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23952" xml_f="24054" txt_i="18234" txt_f="18336">] These pharmacodynamic studies included patients with varying severity of disease and wide age range.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24061" xml_f="24246" txt_i="18337" txt_f="18522">There are limited studies on the management of children with CAH with prednisolone.

The pharmacokinetics of different steroid formulations was not studied by serial blood estimation in our study. Another area of controversy is the bioequivalence dose of prednisolone.
