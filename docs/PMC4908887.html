The eight permutations of the Clinical Reviews will be randomly assigned a number from 1 to 8 by SS. A computer-generated block randomisation procedure will be used, stratified by type (GPs/hospital consultants/junior doctors) and gender.

Each group will have equal numbers of GPs, hospital consultants and junior doctors. Participants will be blinded to their group allocation.
