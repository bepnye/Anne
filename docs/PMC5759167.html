In addition, they were supported in identifying suitable proactive behaviors to engage in as alternatives to the avoidance behaviors. The challenges of engaging in proactive behaviors in situations where one has previously engaged in avoidance behaviors were discussed, together with the principles of systematic exposure. Finally, the new nurses were encouraged to formulate new behavior change goals with the purpose of reducing engagement in avoidance behaviors and increasing engagement in proactive behaviors.

However, it has been recognized that randomization is not always feasible. In such cases, evaluating the likelihood of selection bias is important to avoid incorrect interpretations of results. Thus, although this study did not aim to evaluate between-groups effects, we included a random allocation of participants to two groups in the design to investigate the feasibility of this procedure as well as the likelihood of selection bias when using this procedure. Allocation to groups was performed by the hospital as new nurses were registered to the transition-to-practice program (sequential allocation to the two groups, ratio 1:1).

We found that exhaustion functioned as an antecedent for engaging in passive behaviors such as excessively watching television and sleeping. The problem was further exasperated by loss of antecedents and consequences of engaging in energizing leisure activities. The results are in line with theories of stress suggesting that engagement in active forms of recovery may protect against exhaustion [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22"><offsets xml_i="58552" xml_f="58554" txt_i="43550" txt_f="43552">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="58561" xml_f="58563" txt_i="43552" txt_f="43554">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23"><offsets xml_i="58596" xml_f="58598" txt_i="43554" txt_f="43556">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="58605" xml_f="58607" txt_i="43556" txt_f="43558">].</offsets></p><p id="Par76"><offsets xml_i="58625" xml_f="58770" txt_i="43559" txt_f="43704">The value of person-directed interventions to reduce the risk of stress-related ill health among nurses has similarly been recognized elsewhere [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29"><offsets xml_i="58803" xml_f="58805" txt_i="43704" txt_f="43706">29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="58812" xml_f="58813" txt_i="43706" txt_f="43707">–</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31"><offsets xml_i="58846" xml_f="58848" txt_i="43707" txt_f="43709">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="58855" xml_f="59348" txt_i="43709" txt_f="44202">].
