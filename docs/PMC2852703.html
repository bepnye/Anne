Food residue can be reduced through dietary modification, such as prolonged fasting or liquid diet, or through medication. However, these methods are not effective in some patients. So we devised so called the water intake method. The water intake method, which reduces food residue by drinking a large quantity of water in a short time, is convenient and free from complications and additional cost. Thus, it can reduce food residue more effectively than conventional prolonged fasting. Limitations of water intake method are complaint of slight discomfort caused by drinking an excessive amount of water and retained water found during the endoscopic examination. This study show no serious complication in water intake group, but fluid overload by bolus water intake may be harmful to patients with renal failure or congestive heart failure. The effect of the water intake method is expected to increase by controlling the quantity of water and the drinking time, or by different postures like right lateral decubitus for increasing gastric emptying by gravity. The predictive clinical factors of non-responder for food residue after secondary preparation were important. But the predictive clinical factors between good and poor preparation groups after secondary preparation were not found because of small number of sample size in this study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20481" xml_f="20870" txt_i="14422" txt_f="14811">In conclusion, for patients who had distal gastrectomy, food residue can be reduced through dietary preparation, such as prolonged fasting or liquid diet, or through combined medication, but these methods are not effective in some patients.
