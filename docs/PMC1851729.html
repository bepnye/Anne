Primary outcomes: At the PTEs the prevalence of BV was consistently lower in treatment than placebo arms irrespective of HIV status. The differences were statistically significant mainly in HIV-uninfected women. Prevalence of BV was also reduced over time in both treatment and placebo arms. In a multivariable analysis that controlled for other covariates, the effect of intravaginal metronidazole treatment gel compared with placebo was not substantial: adjusted relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–0.97 in HIV-uninfected women and adjusted RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89–1.01 in HIV-infected women. Secondary outcomes: Intravaginal metronidazole treatment gel significantly increased BV clearance (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.07–1.67 among HIV-uninfected women and adjusted HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06–1.58 among HIV-infected women) but was not associated with decreased BV recurrence. </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="6874" xml_f="6881" txt_i="1945" txt_f="1952">Safety:</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="6890" xml_f="6958" txt_i="1952" txt_f="2020"> No serious adverse events were related to use of intravaginal gels.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st8"><title><offsets xml_i="6989" xml_f="7000" txt_i="2022" txt_f="2033">Conclusion:</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7011" xml_f="7158" txt_i="2034" txt_f="2181">Intermittent microbicide treatment with intravaginal gels is an innovative approach that can reduce the frequency of vaginal infections such as BV.</offsets></p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title><offsets xml_i="7219" xml_f="7239" txt_i="2194" txt_f="2214">Editorial Commentary</offsets></title><sec id="st9"><title></title><p><offsets xml_i="7279" xml_f="7280" txt_i="2216" txt_f="2217">

In pregnant women, it is associated with poorer outcomes in pregnancy, and is also linked with HIV transmission (although it is not certain that BV actually increases the chance of getting HIV—just because these two occur together it does not necessarily follow that one causes the other). BV can be treated with metronidazole tablets, although these can cause gut symptoms and should not be taken repeatedly. The researchers wanted to carry out a multiclinic–based trial to find out whether a metronidazole gel applied intermittently to the vagina (for five nights every three months) would reduce the frequency of BV among women in Malawi. HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women, recruited from postnatal and family planning clinics, were randomized to receive either metronidazole gels, or equivalent placebo gels, every three months and were then followed up for 12 months. The primary outcome for the trial was the proportion of women with BV at each quarterly follow-up visit, and the researchers intended to compare this outcome between treatment arms at each visit and also to look at the overall changes over time among women receiving either metronidazole or placebo, looking separately at HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8672" xml_f="8673" txt_i="3590" txt_f="3591">

The proportion of HIV-uninfected women with BV dropped by around 20% over the course of the trial, both in women using metronidazole and in those using placebo. However, when comparing the proportion of HIV-uninfected women with BV between the two arms of the trial, there did not seem to be a consistent effect: differences were statistically significant at some time points and not others. Among HIV-infected women, there was also a drop over the course of the trial in the proportion of women with BV, irrespective of whether they used metronidazole or placebo. Again, when comparing the rate of BV among HIV-infected women between study arms (metronidazole versus placebo), the researchers did not see a consistent trend; differences were statistically significant at some time points but not others. Overall, when comparing metronidazole and placebo in an analysis that controlled for other factors, the metronidazole gel seemed to show a small effect in reduction of BV among HIV-uninfected women, but no obvious effect among HIV-infected women.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9867" xml_f="9868" txt_i="4766" txt_f="4767">

A key limitation of this study, as the researchers acknowledge, is the absence of a “no treatment” study arm. The frequency of BV dropped over the course of the trial in women using the placebo gel, raising the possibility that the placebo actually has some effect on bacteria in the vagina. However, a trial with a “no treatment” arm would pose its own problems, since trialists and participants would then not be fully blinded as to their treatment status.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10747" xml_f="10748" txt_i="5627" txt_f="5628">

The alternative design of using intermittent oral metronidazole tablets as a comparison arm also has limitations such as nonmasking. Other factors, such as changes in behavior for being in the study, should also be considered for the substantial BV reductions (Hawthorne effect). It is unlikely, however, that the temporal effect of any counseling and clinical services provided during this study has been differential, because these services were for all women and the study personnel were masked. The most plausible explanation for the similar trends in BV reduction in both arms of this study is the inherent activity of the placebo formulation.

In this study, we note that a comparable proportion of HIV-infected and -uninfected women became pregnant. Other studies in sub-Saharan Africa, however, reported lower rates of pregnancy among HIV-infected women due to biological factors limiting fertility in HIV-infected women such as failure to conceive and increased pregnancy losses [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020010-b024" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46807" xml_f="46809" txt_i="34438" txt_f="34440">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46816" xml_f="47069" txt_i="34440" txt_f="34693">].
