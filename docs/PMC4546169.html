The clinical logs were used by healthcare staff, predominantly nursing staff (registered) and healthcare assistants (non-registered), to undertake and record delivery of the SVP each day. One clinical log was completed for each patient for each day that they received the SVP. There were two types of clinical logs corresponding to the two SVP regimes, prompted voiding and bladder training. The patient’s details and an appropriate voiding interval were recorded on the clinical log at the start of each day. The ‘voiding interval’ refers to the specified length of time between each void, e.g. “3-hourly”, and healthcare staff were asked to select an appropriate voiding interval for each patient at the beginning of every day. Based upon the voiding interval, healthcare staff were asked to record a schedule of proposed voiding times for the patient to follow throughout the day (from 7.30 am until 9.30 pm). Subsequently, any healthcare staff caring for the patient that day, which may have included the staff member who originally wrote the schedule, attempted to follow the schedule of proposed voiding times: the aim being for the patient to void within 30 min of each proposed voiding time. Thirty minutes’ leeway was agreed as a balance between expert opinion that voiding should occur within 10 min of the proposed voiding time and the need to be pragmatic and realistic when working in an acute or rehabilitation setting. After every void, healthcare staff were asked to document the actual voiding time and document whether a number of ‘best practice’ components had been achieved (e.g. giving encouragement; asking the patient if they were wet).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="results"><title><offsets xml_i="17422" xml_f="17429" txt_i="10258" txt_f="10265">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17440" xml_f="17777" txt_i="10266" txt_f="10603">Healthcare staff were provided with written information in the form of an intervention protocol regarding how to undertake the SVP, and training was provided in the form of both online training and/or face-to-face training.

In this trial, the voiding interval and schedule of proposed voiding times were not documented as expected. It is important for researchers to consider for every component of a complex intervention ways in which actual practice may deviate from the protocol, and take steps to minimise this.

It was not possible to calculate these numbers due to the complexities inherent in the delivery of the SVP. For example, sometimes patients would start and stop the SVP at various time points during their stay due to needing a catheter for a short period, or due to becoming temporarily medically unstable, and the dates for these variations were not consistently recorded. This meant that it was not possible to reliably calculate the theoretical numbers of clinical logs that should have been received. The first step in fidelity to delivery of the SVP was the completion of a clinical log and therefore a comparison of the numbers of clinical logs expected and received could add another stage to the assessment of fidelity to treatment delivery.

Documentation of an appropriate voiding interval and a correct schedule of proposed voiding times (Stages 1 and 2) was often not done correctly. The original intention was to determine whether a patient had voided within 30 min of the proposed voiding time, but when this method proved unfeasible it was necessary to reconsider what constituted a reasonably valid method to assess ‘fidelity’. It was decided that the documentation of an appropriate voiding interval and a correct schedule of proposed voiding times were the first steps in the successful undertaking of the SVP and should therefore be the first steps in the assessment of fidelity to treatment delivery. The clinical logs that did not contain both these components (61.1 % in the Intervention sites; 68.1 % in the Supported Implementation sites) therefore lacked the necessary information for healthcare staff to be able to follow the SVP throughout the day and this constitutes a lack of fidelity. It is unclear why this happened, but one possible explanation is that healthcare staff misunderstood the principles of the SVP. In the future trial this needs to be addressed through detailed consideration of methods of implementation of the SVP, for example giving healthcare staff time to become familiar with and practice using the SVP before the trial intervention period begins [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23"><offsets xml_i="40839" xml_f="40841" txt_i="30701" txt_f="30703">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40848" xml_f="40850" txt_i="30703" txt_f="30705">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27"><offsets xml_i="40883" xml_f="40885" txt_i="30705" txt_f="30707">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40892" xml_f="41013" txt_i="30707" txt_f="30828">].

These components were only examined for clinical logs that achieved Stages 1 and 2. It was found that the length of the voiding interval did vary across days and across patients (data not presented), and this suggests that there was some individualisation of voiding interval. The mean number of proposed voiding times per clinical log was also relatively high for each arm, at around five for both arms, given that the voiding interval was almost always between 2-hourly and 3-hourly (as shown in Fig. </offsets><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"><offsets xml_i="41970" xml_f="41971" txt_i="31747" txt_f="31748">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41978" xml_f="42237" txt_i="31748" txt_f="32007">) and that the SVP only ran from 7.30 am until 9.30 pm.

A key principle of the SVP is that voiding occurs at a regular, consistent interval as part of a progressive voiding schedule [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28"><offsets xml_i="42582" xml_f="42584" txt_i="32313" txt_f="32315">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42591" xml_f="42593" txt_i="32315" txt_f="32317">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29"><offsets xml_i="42626" xml_f="42628" txt_i="32317" txt_f="32319">29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42635" xml_f="43139" txt_i="32319" txt_f="32823">]; on a substantial proportion of occasions ICONS patients did not void at, or close to, the scheduled time. Fidelity to this principle of the SVP therefore appeared to be relatively low. One possible explanation for the relatively low fidelity is that returning to all patients on the SVP at their individualised times posed the most challenges to practice and was not always achievable. Additionally, there is evidence that staffing levels associated with weekend working can affect clinical outcomes [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30"><offsets xml_i="43172" xml_f="43174" txt_i="32823" txt_f="32825">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43181" xml_f="43551" txt_i="32825" txt_f="33195">], and it is possible that documentation of the SVP and fidelity to it could have been affected by different patterns of working/staffing at weekends versus in the week. However, exploring such patterns was beyond the scope of this paper. When fidelity to the intervention is low, the degree to which trial outcomes can be attributed to the intervention is compromised [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31"><offsets xml_i="43584" xml_f="43586" txt_i="33195" txt_f="33197">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43593" xml_f="43595" txt_i="33197" txt_f="33199">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43602" xml_f="44297" txt_i="33200" txt_f="33895">Fidelity to two ‘best practice’ components of the SVP, giving the patient encouragement and asking the patient if they were wet, was relatively high, although data for these components were extracted only from clinical logs that achieved Stages 1 and 2. Whilst these results are encouraging, they should be interpreted with caution as healthcare staff simply documented ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in relation to the two components, and, without asking for further detail to be provided about the manner in which these elements were provided, it is difficult to assess how accurate these measures are. There is also the risk of positive bias in self-reporting these more subjective elements of the programme [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25"><offsets xml_i="44330" xml_f="44332" txt_i="33895" txt_f="33897">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44339" xml_f="44341" txt_i="33897" txt_f="33899">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44348" xml_f="44890" txt_i="33900" txt_f="34442">A limitation of this study is that the analysis does not reflect the sampling strategy, which had two levels of clustering – by time and by patient. In our analysis we grouped together the clinical logs per site and then per trial arm and presented pooled results. The data were merged in this fashion in order to simplify the analysis and subsequent presentation. This method is unlikely to have affected our overall conclusions in relation to treatment fidelity, but would have implications if we were to perform any inferential statistics.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44897" xml_f="46069" txt_i="34443" txt_f="35615">Key lessons have been learnt from the assessment of fidelity to treatment delivery in the ICONS trial. Real-life practice may often deviate from the protocol: the ICONS protocol for the SVP was often not followed and this highlights how important it is for researchers to consider how real-life practice may deviate from what was intended and explore ways in which to minimise this. An iterative approach to fidelity assessment is important in trials of complex interventions: ideally, fidelity data should be examined and analysed whilst the trial is ongoing, allowing issues to be addressed as the trial progresses. Different ways of defining and assessing fidelity should be considered: trials of complex interventions should consider the relative merits of subjective, self-reported measures of fidelity versus more objective measures, such as direct observation, and select the method most feasible and appropriate for the study. More comprehensive implementation strategies will be important in a future evaluation trial in order to improve fidelity, given that the overall fidelity to treatment delivery in the ICONS feasibility trial appeared to be relatively low.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="46125" xml_f="46136" txt_i="35617" txt_f="35628">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="46147" xml_f="47414" txt_i="35629" txt_f="36896">Fidelity to treatment delivery has been explored in detail in the ICONS feasibility trial. The feasibility of a proposed method for fidelity assessment has been investigated and lessons learnt from this experience will guide fidelity assessment in a future evaluation trial and may be of use to other research teams designing trials of complex interventions. Whilst it is important to agree upon strategies for implementing and assessing fidelity to treatment delivery during the design phase, researchers should still be prepared to adapt their planned methods during a trial in line with evolving issues. The assessment of fidelity should be an iterative process, with opportunities for fidelity data gathered to inform ongoing strategies to monitor and improve fidelity to treatment delivery. This exploration of fidelity to treatment delivery of the ICONS intervention (the SVP) has highlighted issues in the implementation of the SVP that will need to be addressed in a future trial. By addressing these issues it is possible that we will be able to improve healthcare staff fidelity to the protocol and potentially allow greater flexibility in delivery of the protocol amongst healthcare staff whilst not adversely impacting on the active components of the SVP.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12874_2015_51_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
