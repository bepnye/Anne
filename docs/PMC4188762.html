Moreover, remifentanil reduced the hemodynamic changes after endotracheal intubation, effectively.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The present study was supported by grants from the Clinical Medicine Research Institute at Chosun University Hospital, 2012.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>AY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alfentanil is comparable to remifentanil in preventing withdrawal movement following rocuronium injection</article-title><source>J Clin Anesth</source><year>2009</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>9</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19232934</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lockey</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Coleman</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pain during injection of rocuronium bromide</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>1995</year><volume>50</volume><fpage>474</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7793569</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mencke</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Beerhalter</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Fuchs-Buder</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Spontaneous movements, local reactions and pain on injection of rocuronium.
