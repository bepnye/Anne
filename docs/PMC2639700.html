Those assigned to the 4 KKW group remained at this dose for the duration of the study while those assigned to the 8 and 12 KKW groups continued to increase their energy expenditure 1 KKW until their assigned exercise level was reached. All exercise sessions were performed under supervision in an exercise laboratory, and strict monitoring of the amount of exercise completed during each session was performed. Participants were weighed each week, and their weight was multiplied by their exercise dosage to determine the number of calories to be expended for the week. Women in the exercise groups alternated training sessions on semi-recumbent cycle ergometers and treadmills. Adherence to exercise training over the entire 6-month period was calculated for each individual by dividing the caloric expenditure during the exercise training by the caloric expenditure prescribed for the training period ×100%</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16317" xml_f="17340" txt_i="9207" txt_f="10230">Fitness testing was conducted using a Lode Excalibur Sport cycle ergometer (Groningen, Netherlands), an electronic, rate-independent ergometer. Participants cycled at 30 Watts (W) for 2 min, 50 W for 4 min, followed by increases of 20 W every 2 min until they could no longer maintain a pedal cadence of 50 rpm. Respiratory gases were measured using a Parvomedics True Max 2400 Metabolic Measurement Cart. Breath-by-breath respiratory gases were measured using a Parvomedics True Max 2400 Metabolic Measurement Cart. Volume and gas calibrations were conducted before each test. Gas-exchange variables (VO2, CO2 production, ventilation, and respiratory exchange ratio [RER]) were averaged every 15 s. Heart rate was measured directly from the ECG monitoring system. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were obtained using the 20-point Borg scale. Two fitness tests were performed on separate days at baseline and follow-up, and the average value from these two tests were used for baseline and follow-up values for analyses.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17347" xml_f="18433" txt_i="10231" txt_f="11317">There were two sources of weight data. The primary analysis was performed using the weights measured at baseline and follow-up in the clinical assessment laboratory. These visits occurred in the morning under fasting conditions. Weight was measured on an electronic scale (Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA) and height was measured using a standard stadiometer. This scale was calibrated weekly. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. For the individuals in the exercise groups there was a second source of weight data available for analysis. These were the weights taken during the first exercise session of each week in the exercise training room. We used the same type of electronic scale for these measurements and each scale was calibrated weekly. These weights were used to determine the exercise prescription for the week and were taken in the non-fasted state with participants wearing their workout clothes but no shoes. Waist and hip circumference were measured using the recommendations of the Airlie Conference.</offsets><xref rid="pone.0004515-Lohman1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18482" xml_f="18486" txt_i="11317" txt_f="11321">[21]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18493" xml_f="18590" txt_i="11321" txt_f="11418"> Body fat was estimated from the sum of four skinfolds; triceps, abdomen, iliac crest and thigh. </offsets><xref rid="pone.0004515-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18640" xml_f="18644" txt_i="11418" txt_f="11422">[22]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18651" xml_f="18652" txt_i="11422" txt_f="11423">

Participants whose weight compensation was greater than zero were defined as compensators. For each group we also calculated the mean percent of predicted weight loss achieved (actual/predicted ×100%). Weight compensation cannot occur in the control group; therefore, their data were not eligible for analysis. Differences in outcomes among the randomization groups were tested by ANOVA with adjustment as appropriate. For statistically significant ANOVAs (p&lt;.05), all pairwise comparisons among the randomization groups were tested using Tukey studentized range adjustment. Results are presented as adjusted least-squares means with confidence intervals. For each exercise group, we examined mean predicted weight loss, actual weight loss and compensation for weeks 1 through 23. Using ANOVAs (p&lt;.05) with adjustment for multiple comparisons we examined if the mean compensation for each group was statistically different from zero for each week of the intervention.

There were no between groups difference in baseline or follow-up in dietary protein, fat and carbohydrate intake (data not included). To explore mechanisms of weight loss in the control group, we categorized individuals in the control group into those that lost weight (n = 51) and those that maintained or increased weight (n = 37), and we examined mean follow-up energy intake adjusted for baseline energy intake. The individuals in the control group that lost weight had a lower energy intake at follow-up compared to individuals in the control group that did not lose weight (1766 [1618, 1927] versus 2035 [1820, 2239] kcal, P = 0.04). In the exercise groups we observed no difference in mean follow-up energy intake adjusted for baseline energy intake between the compensators and non-compensators.

We confirmed the findings of previous studies that a relatively high dose of exercise (12 KKW or 194 minutes per week) results in compensatory mechanisms that attenuate weight loss in previously sedentary women. However, a dose of exercise consistent with the exercise prescription for general health (8 KKW or 136 minutes per week) did not result in compensation as the actual weight loss closely matched the predicted weight loss. An exercise dose of 4 KKW (72 minutes per week) also resulted in weight loss that slightly exceeded the predicted weight loss. Our findings are important because most exercise guidelines for weight loss recommend 200–300 minutes per week and we provide evidence that this amount of exercise induces compensation that results in significantly less weight loss than predicted. Our findings of different doses of exercise resulting in different amounts of compensation may in part explain the discrepant results from previous exercise and weight loss studies. If different doses of exercise result in different amounts of compensation it is not surprising that when exercise studies of varying doses and duration are examined collectively there is no relation between exercise dose and weight loss. Our findings provide an excellent example of the complex nature of the energy expenditure and energy intake relation, and the importance of considering both sides of the equation in creating weight loss programs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45605" xml_f="45717" txt_i="28419" txt_f="28531">Numerous well conducted clinical exercise trials of long duration have reported less weight loss than expected. </offsets><xref rid="pone.0004515-Ross1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="45764" xml_f="45767" txt_i="28531" txt_f="28534">[9]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45774" xml_f="45999" txt_i="28534" txt_f="28759"> For example, Donnelly et al observed that after 18 months of exercise training and achieving 2000 kcal per week of exercise, college-aged women had no weight loss, although women in the control group actually gained weight. </offsets><xref rid="pone.0004515-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46050" xml_f="46054" txt_i="28759" txt_f="28763">[11]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46061" xml_f="46234" txt_i="28763" txt_f="28936"> In a follow-up report Donnelly et al suggested that the observed “compensation” was due to increased energy intake, not changes in metabolic rate or non-exercise activity. </offsets><xref rid="pone.0004515-Donnelly2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46285" xml_f="46289" txt_i="28936" txt_f="28940">[24]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46296" xml_f="46753" txt_i="28940" txt_f="29397"> A recent report by King et al provides support that increased energy intake may be a major source of energy compensation as they noted that after 12 weeks of 2500 kcal per week in exercise training energy expenditure, in those individuals that did not lose the predicted amount of weight (compensators) there was a increase in caloric intake while in those that lost the predicted amount of weight (non-compensators) there was no change in caloric intake. </offsets><xref rid="pone.0004515-King1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46800" xml_f="46804" txt_i="29397" txt_f="29401">[10]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46811" xml_f="47043" txt_i="29401" txt_f="29633"> Unlikely sources of the observed compensation in the DREW study include changes in resting metabolic rate and the thermogenic effect of food as previous studies have found these variables not to be influenced by exercise training. </offsets><xref rid="pone.0004515-Donnelly2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="47094" xml_f="47098" txt_i="29633" txt_f="29637">[24]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47105" xml_f="47287" txt_i="29637" txt_f="29819"> Our step counter data suggests that there was no change in outside activity in the exercise groups, nor were there any differences in average daily steps among the exercise groups. </offsets><xref rid="pone.0004515-Church1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="47336" xml_f="47340" txt_i="29819" txt_f="29823">[15]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47347" xml_f="47551" txt_i="29823" txt_f="30027"> Though doubly-labeled water or accelerometer data would have presumably been more accurate than our step data, it is still unlikely that substantial changes in non-exercise activity explain our findings.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47558" xml_f="47801" txt_i="30028" txt_f="30271">In the previously published DREW primary outcomes paper we reported that the mean follow-up waist circumference was lower in all exercise groups compared to the control group and there was no difference in mean follow-up weight across groups. </offsets><xref rid="pone.0004515-Church1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="47850" xml_f="47854" txt_i="30271" txt_f="30275">[15]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47861" xml_f="48453" txt_i="30275" txt_f="30867"> The current analysis allowed us to further explore the change in weight data including examining individual level data as well as weight compensation.

Our findings highlight the need for more research, in particular large randomized controlled clinical trials, exploring the dose of physical activity required to prevent weight gain as 60 minutes a day may present itself as a daunting undertaking for most individuals but even more so for a habitually sedentary individuals. In addition, this dose may well lead to compensation by more individuals, and to less success in weight loss.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="52225" xml_f="52976" txt_i="34217" txt_f="34968">Strengths of the DREW study include that it is an efficacy study, using a tightly controlled exercise doses, with all exercise completed in the laboratory and extensive monitoring of exercise energy expenditure. We obtained excellent exercise adherence and had a low dropout rate. Monitoring of steps per day throughout the 6-month period indicates that outside physical activity remained constant throughout the trial for all exercise groups, thus ensuring that observed group differences were due to the prescribed exercise dose. Further, the exercise doses, including intensity, are easily obtainable and are well tolerated by sedentary women; and this has important public health implications for refining future physical activity recommendations.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="52983" xml_f="53749" txt_i="34969" txt_f="35735">The study has limitations because the sample is limited to sedentary, overweight or obese, postmenopausal women with elevated blood pressure.
