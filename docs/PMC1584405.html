One nurse and one care manager were employed to carry out the project. Half of the pensioners were assigned to each visitor. The nurse and the care manager followed their "own" pensioners for the duration of the programme, making visits to each pensioner's home.

The result for the intervention period is significant when an "on treatment" analysis is used despite the relatively small groups. The result also shows that both men and woman gain from PHV, even if female mortality in general is lower. In terms of mortality there is a tendency for single persons to gain more from PHV than cohabitants (Fig </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"><offsets xml_i="17352" xml_f="17353" txt_i="12142" txt_f="12143">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17360" xml_f="17912" txt_i="12143" txt_f="12695">.). However the positive effect is there only as long as PHV are ongoing. Is the effect on mortality time-limited or was compliance to the recommendations lower when the programme of visits ended? We cannot answer that question. We know that many seniors described that the visits gave a sense of security, a feeling of being important and they reported improved self-rated health along the path of visits. That could partly explain the difference in mortality patterns. It has been shown that self-rated health is important to maintaining good health[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><offsets xml_i="17944" xml_f="17946" txt_i="12695" txt_f="12697">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17953" xml_f="17955" txt_i="12697" txt_f="12699">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17962" xml_f="18124" txt_i="12700" txt_f="12862">The trial in Nordmaling was one of 21 different PHV projects in Sweden and the results concerning health and well-being from the other trials were also positive [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="18156" xml_f="18158" txt_i="12862" txt_f="12864">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18165" xml_f="18166" txt_i="12864" txt_f="12865">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="18198" xml_f="18200" txt_i="12865" txt_f="12867">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18207" xml_f="18917" txt_i="12867" txt_f="13577">], but the effect of PHV on mortality has not been measured elsewhere in Sweden. When conducting a trial in a small community it is important to get public support for the idea that only some community members will potentially benefit from the intervention. In this trial, therefore, the local pensioners' associations were invited to discuss the possibility of all people aged 75+ years receiving PHV in the future. The possibility of expanding the home visit programme to all people aged 75+ years in the community, should the trial produce positive results, was also discussed with representatives of the municipality. The pensioners' associations also became active partners in the management of the trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18924" xml_f="19270" txt_i="13578" txt_f="13924">All participants in the trial used regular health care. Health care providers in primary and long-term facilities were blinded to the trial, as far as possible.

To reduce contamination between the intervention group and the control group, the spouses of pensioners randomized to the intervention group were also invited to participate. As a consequence the proportion of cohabitants is larger in the intervention group than in the control group. This difference gives rise to opposite effects. The death rates in the intervention group during the study period can be expected to be lower because cohabitant living is normally a protective factor. On the other hand, our data reveals that the interventions have had a smaller effect among cohabitants. The effects may cancel each other out because the result, when excluding the spouses allocated to the intervention group, due to family affiliation and not due to birth-date did not change. Furthermore, it is unrealistic to assume that all members in the control group had absolutely no exposure to the intervention [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"><offsets xml_i="20490" xml_f="20492" txt_i="15100" txt_f="15102">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20499" xml_f="20622" txt_i="15102" txt_f="15225">].

An effort was made to telephone all 46 persons who refused to participate and still lived in the community. Five individuals refused to give any additional information and 16 individuals did not answer the call. Thirteen people stated that they had no need for a visit and four individuals gave different medical reasons for not participating. The remainder stressed different aspects of personal autonomy such as "I manage by myself" or "I want to have privacy". In the drop-out group the proportion of youngest old (75–80 years) is higher than in the other groups. Admission to hospital before the trial was less common in the drop-out group, (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="21449" xml_f="21450" txt_i="15977" txt_f="15978">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21457" xml_f="21547" txt_i="15978" txt_f="16068">) indicating that it is reasonable to expect a lower mortality rate in the drop-out group.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21554" xml_f="22565" txt_i="16069" txt_f="17080">Considering the circumstances described above, the best mode of analysis is not obvious. The allocation of spouses as well as drop-outs has probably introduced bias. One important reason to use an "intention-to-treat" (ITT) analysis is that this analysis reflects how PHV, in this case, will perform in a population and takes care of the selection bias introduced by drop-outs. However, the inclusion criteria used are very general and the natural selection process is possibly more appropriate. The intervention is offered to the all people 75 years and older living independently, and those feeling quite healthy are likely to reject the offer and postpone participation for some years. Taking all into account, we have in this article decided to present the results both as "intention to treat" and as "on treatment" analyses. The differences in effect size and significance level between ITT and OT most likely mirrors the above reasoning – when the more healthy drop-outs are included the effect decreases.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22572" xml_f="22788" txt_i="17081" txt_f="17297">Another important question is whether the efficacy in this trial can be transferred to effectiveness in ordinary care activities.

The pensioners in the intervention group felt that they were specially selected and appreciated being part of the PHV trial. Elton Mayo describes this phenomenon as one possible explanation for positive results. In this intervention it was desirable to create a Hawthorne effect, not as an explanation for the result but as a part of the intervention itself. It was considered beneficial for the participants to feel that they were appreciated and had the potential to remain healthy and secure.

This is important if the control group used as the reference uses the same regular services as the intervention group. All people in Sweden have good access to medical treatment, however preventive activities for old people have been withdrawn over the last decade due to lack of resources and there has been a marked redistribution of resources to individuals with comprehensive care needs[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="25232" xml_f="25234" txt_i="19465" txt_f="19467">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25241" xml_f="26062" txt_i="19467" txt_f="20288">]. This implies that access to preventive health care and long-term care for older persons with fairly good health is less than several years ago. A change in regular care available to the control-group, may alter the result of the intervention, e.g. measured as incidence rate ratio. It is therefore reasonable to state that a home visit programme in Sweden is more valuable today than it would have been a decade ago. In other countries the situation may be different. This trial shows that PHV is favourable in the Swedish context but that it is inappropriate to generalize these findings to other countries and other contexts. While this makes it difficult to formulate general recommendations, we believe that this trial provides sufficient evidence for implementing structured PHV programmes in the Swedish context.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26084" xml_f="26094" txt_i="20290" txt_f="20300">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26105" xml_f="26224" txt_i="20301" txt_f="20420">Preventive home-visits can postpone mortality in a healthy older population but the mortality effect can only be shown </offsets><underline><offsets xml_i="26235" xml_f="26241" txt_i="20420" txt_f="20426">during</offsets></underline><offsets xml_i="26253" xml_f="26412" txt_i="20426" txt_f="20585"> the intervention period.
