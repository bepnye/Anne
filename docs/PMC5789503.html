Written informed consent was obtained from the patients who agreed to participate in the study. Patients 18–60 years of age with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II were deemed eligible for the study. The following exclusion criteria were applied: allergy to local anesthetics, history of upper respiratory tract infection within the previous 2 weeks, persistent type of hyperreactive airway or asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, moderate to heavy smoking (smoking of at least 11 cigarettes per day or daily water pipe smoking), intubation difficulty requiring more than one intubation attempt, and current use of sedatives or narcotics (i.e., psychiatric or pain control medications).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7393" xml_f="8993" txt_i="3867" txt_f="5467">Using random allocation software and a 1:1 ratio with an equal block size of 10 per block in numeric sequential sequence, the subjects were randomized into 1 of 2 study drug arms: placebo (normal saline) or lidocaine HCl (Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL 60045 USA). The anesthesiologist was given a concealed 10-cc syringe containing 10 mg/ml lidocaine or normal saline; the syringe was prepared by the assigned technician who generated the random allocation sequence and who was responsible for assigning participants to each intervention. Patients were randomized immediately after induction of anesthesia. Before discontinuing desflurane, a bolus of lidocaine or placebo was administered to each patient at a dose of 1 mg/kg (i.e., a volume of 0.1 ml/kg), with a maximum dose of 100 mg (10 ml) (i.e., patients weighing over 100 kg received a fixed dose of 100 mg). Because of body composition differences between nonobese and obese patients, this procedure was followed to prevent the prospect of overdose and to maintain blinding of the study arms. The syringe design allowed the addition of 0–0.1 ml (0–1 mg) of the administered study drug. We elected to discontinue the use of desflurane upon the administration of the study drugs based on the assumption that a 5-min period before extubation was clinically applicable (i.e., the anticipated awake status following general anesthesia); no study has evaluated the effect of IV lidocaine administered more than 5 min before extubation. The patients and research team remained blinded to the drug administration until all of the data were analyzed.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9000" xml_f="9785" txt_i="5468" txt_f="6253">General anesthesia was conducted to all patients.

Then, patients were intravenously induced with 1% propofol (2 mg/kg), 2.5 mcg/kg fentanyl, and 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium besilate. After manual ventilation with oxygen-desflurane for 3 min, a properly sized endotracheal tube (ETT, size 7.5 for males and size 7 for females) was placed using the appropriate Macintosh laryngoscope blade; neither instrument was lubricated with lidocaine gel or spray.

The patients were mechanically ventilated, and the gas flow was set on autocontrol. An orogastric tube (OGT) was inserted. A temperature probe was placed orally, and a warmer device was applied to maintain the body temperature of the patient above 36°C throughout the procedure. One gram of paracetamol was infused.

At the time of the last surgical suture, 2.5 mg of neostigmine and 0.4 mg of glycopyrrolate were administered intravenously. Next, the OGT was removed, and the oral cavity of the patient was suctioned gently with a disposable suction catheter (size 14) using a finger control valve. The time interval between injecting the reversal drugs and discontinuing desflurane was 5–7 min. When the patient was cleared by the surgeons and the nurses, desflurane was discontinued, and the study drug (1 mg/kg actual body weight) was intravenously injected, after which the patients were placed in a semi-Fowler's position. The oral cavity was gently suctioned for a second time, and the ETT cuff was slowly deflated. Absolutely no stimulation was allowed until the patient awoke spontaneously.

Five of seven patients had a partial postoperative laryngospasm, which was easily detected and managed by applying continuous positive airway pressure. One of the seven patient events was a complete postoperative laryngospasm, which was managed by intermittent positive pressure ventilation with jaw trust maneuver, and 1 out of 7 patient events resulted in cyanosis, which required reintubation. It was a wise decision to suspend recruitment and begin investigation after the last incidence of postoperative laryngospasm. It was necessary to disclose limited data to the DMC to guide the DMC in this decision.

To maintain a MAC 1 of desflurane with spontaneous breathing, the inspired concentration of desflurane was increased to 8% with a flow rate of 6 l/min.

Maintaining the concentration of inspired desflurane at 6% and deprioritizing the maintenance of MAC 1 during the extubation process may have influenced the results. However, the DMC terminated the study for safety concerns because the incidence of laryngospasm would not decrease upon the next interim analysis, the incidence was significantly different between the two groups, and the anticipation of postoperative laryngospasm would be extremely difficult considering that the HR was not evidently a marker.

The cause of laryngospasm in our study was most likely the rapid increase in the concentration of inspired desflurane, which might have caused airway irritation.
