Parental monitoring approaches are varied and may be modified with successful interventions but not all parents or adolescents respond to monitoring programs the same way. 339 parent-adolescent dyads randomized to receive a parental monitoring intervention and 169 parent-adolescent dyads in the control group were followed for one year over four measurement periods. Parent attitudes about the usefulness of monitoring, the importance of trust and respecting their teens' privacy, and the appropriateness of adolescent risk-taking behavior and experimentation were examined as predictors of longitudinal change in parental monitoring and open communication. Similar effects were found in both the intervention and control group models regarding open communication. Parental attitudes impacted longitudinal patterns of teen-reported parent monitoring, and these patterns differed across experimental groups. In the intervention group, parents' beliefs about the importance of trust and privacy were associated with a steeper decline in monitoring across time. Finally, parents' attitudes about the normative nature of teen experimentation were associated with a quadratic parental monitoring time trend in the intervention but not the control group. These findings suggest that parental attitudes may impact how families respond to an adolescent risk intervention.</offsets></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title><offsets xml_i="4713" xml_f="4728" txt_i="1482" txt_f="1497">1.

Instead, findings potentially point to normative, developmental processes whereby parent attitudes affect subsequent communication between parents and adolescents. Open communication may be central to other family-based interventions, especially those designed to enhance parent-adolescent discussion of sexual risk behavior and AIDS. Parental attitudes toward teens' sexually-specific risk behavior and beliefs concerning teens' right to privacy regarding their sexual lives may impact the effectiveness of such interventions.

Within the intervention group model but not the control group model, parental beliefs about the normative nature of teen risk taking behavior were positively associated with longitudinal change in parental monitoring. When parents believed that teenage risk-taking was normal and to be expected, adolescents reported increasing parental monitoring across the four waves of the study. However, this finding was qualified by a quadratic effect (combined effects displayed in </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><offsets xml_i="36640" xml_f="36648" txt_i="30024" txt_f="30032">Figure 3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36655" xml_f="37418" txt_i="30032" txt_f="30795">). When parents viewed risk behavior as normative, teens initially reported a sharp increase in parental monitoring from baseline to 4-month assessment, but reported gradually less monitoring over the final two waves of the study. The instruction in the intervention combined with established attitudes that problem behavior was normative may have led these parents to escalate their monitoring behaviors right after the intervention. However, parents' belief that problem behavior was unavoidable potentially led them to see little utility in maintaining high levels of supervision. Research has found that parents' beliefs concerning the legitimacy of parental authority are associated with their engagement in direct monitoring behaviors such as solicitation [</offsets><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="37450" xml_f="37452" txt_i="30795" txt_f="30797">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37459" xml_f="38093" txt_i="30797" txt_f="31431">]. Interestingly, parents who did not believe teen delinquency was normative initially reduced their monitoring behaviors, but then gradually increased their levels of monitoring across the remaining waves. For these parents, the effects of the intervention on their monitoring behaviors may have been slightly delayed due to their established beliefs about normal adolescent development. It is important to note that similar, though nonsignificant, coefficients were found in the control group model, so it is likely that the intervention intensified a more normative association between parenting attitudes and monitoring behaviors.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38100" xml_f="39507" txt_i="31432" txt_f="32839"> In contrast, the effects of parenting beliefs regarding trust and privacy on the teen-reported monitoring time slopes were greatly disparate across the control and intervention group models. Interestingly, while teen-reported monitoring decreased across time in the intervention group, parents' positive attitudes toward privacy and trust exacerbated this downward trend. The COPA intervention encouraged parents to actively solicit information from their teens and engage in other direct monitoring activities. However, parents who viewed their teenagers as trustworthy and believed it was important to respect teens' privacy may have considered such parenting behaviors to be violations of their teens' trust leading to a reactive stance and engagement in fewer monitoring activities over time. It is important to note that trust/privacy beliefs were not associated with differences in monitoring behavior at baseline assessment. Thus, it is possible that the intervention was initially effective at increasing these parents' monitoring activities to a level similar to parents who expressed lower trust/privacy beliefs. However, parents' attitudes interfered with the long-term maintenance of the monitoring behaviors learned in the intervention. An alternative explanation is that parents who had higher levels of trust in their teens encouraged more frequent disclosure on the part of the adolescent [</offsets><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="39539" xml_f="39541" txt_i="32839" txt_f="32841">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39548" xml_f="39625" txt_i="32841" txt_f="32918">], which reduced the need for them to engage in active monitoring strategies.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec4.3"><title><offsets xml_i="39681" xml_f="39725" txt_i="32920" txt_f="32964">4.3. Application to Behavioral Interventions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39736" xml_f="41246" txt_i="32965" txt_f="34475"> The current study demonstrates that parents vary in their attitudes concerning normative adolescent development and the efficacy of monitoring activities. The attitudes of parents enrolled in the intervention predicted longitudinal change in their monitoring activities, indicating that parental beliefs influenced whether the intervention was successful in establishing long-term changes in parenting activities aimed at reducing teen problem behavior. One explanation for this pattern of findings is that parents' who hold different beliefs may be more or less open to receiving instruction. Parents who see little utility in increasing their monitoring activity either because they view delinquency as inevitable or because they view such behavior as potentially disruptive to their relationship with their teen may be less likely to invest themselves wholeheartedly in the didactic components of an instructional intervention. Even if they participate fully, long-held beliefs may interfere with parents' willingness to consistently apply what they have learned, especially over an extended period of time. Interestingly, it was parents' attitudes about trust/privacy and delinquency and not their attitudes about the efficacy of monitoring which were associated with patterns of change in parental monitoring. Thus, it is important to consider not only individual's attitudes toward the specific goals of the intervention, but also related beliefs which may affect individual's views of the intervention.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41253" xml_f="42094" txt_i="34476" txt_f="35317"> Findings from this study demonstrate the importance of considering ways in which individuals' beliefs and attitudes may influence receptivity to an intervention aimed at decreasing risky behavior. The current study examined heterogeneity regarding relatively innocuous parental attitudes. However, parents may have more strongly-held beliefs about more sensitive topics such as attitudes toward sexual behavior beliefs about their children being at risk for sexually transmitted infections such as AIDS. The effectiveness of an intervention aimed at increasing parent-adolescent communication about such potentially “touchy” issues may be heavily influenced by parents' attitudes. Interventions which are not sensitive to individual beliefs or flexible enough to account for variability in attitudes may be ineffective at changing behavior.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec4.4"><title><offsets xml_i="42150" xml_f="42188" txt_i="35319" txt_f="35357">4.4.

However, these strengths and the findings should be interpreted in light of the studies' limitations. First, the final sample enrolled for the randomized controlled trial of the COPA intervention included unequal representation of boys and girls. The greater proportion of girls and mothers participating in the study limit the application of these finding to fathers and sons. The study samples were also recruited from a rural setting and, therefore, do not represent the same parental attitudes found within families of suburban or inner city areas.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42937" xml_f="43752" txt_i="36090" txt_f="36905"> With an approach that examined new parent attitudes about monitoring, this study expands upon our understanding of the different ways in which parent-adolescent dyads might respond to a parental monitoring intervention program. Understanding the way in which parents' monitoring attitudes might affect their interactions with their adolescents and particular choices of monitoring will be needed in future studies. Based on these initial findings, a greater assessment of parent monitoring attitudes, and would be needed to identify additional program strategies for enhancing parent-adolescent communication and direct monitoring. More generally, the current study argues for the importance of considering heterogeneity in individual attitudes and beliefs when designing and implementing behavioral interventions.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This paper was supported by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Public Health Service (5APRPA006003-02-00).
