Inadequate proportions of children in the U.S, including those of preschool age, are meeting physical activity recommendations. In response to low numbers of preschool children attaining appropriate physical activity levels, combined with the large number of young children who attend preschool, researchers have identified the need to devise interventions to increase physical activity at preschools. However, few multi-component interventions to increase physical activity in preschool children exist. The aims of this study were to observe the effects of a multi-component intervention on physical activity, sedentary behavior, and physical activity energy expenditure in 3-5 year-old children; identify factors that associate with change in those variables; and evaluate the process of implementing the multi-component intervention. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the study design and intervention protocol.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5398" xml_f="5412" txt_i="1009" txt_f="1023">Methods/design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5423" xml_f="6569" txt_i="1024" txt_f="2170">The overall design of the Study of Health and Activity in Preschool Environments (SHAPES) was a two-year randomized trial (nested cohort design), with two conditions, two measurement occasions, and preschool serving as the unit of analysis. Sixteen schools (eight intervention and eight control) were enrolled. The intervention protocol was based on the social ecological model and included four main components: (a) indoor physical activity (“move inside”), (b) recess (“move outside”), (c) daily lessons (“move to learn”), and (d) social environment. Components were implemented using teacher and administrator trainings and workshops, site support visits, newsletters, and self-monitoring methods. Outcomes included accelerometer assessment of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and physical activity energy expenditure; weight status; and demographic factors; family/home social and physical environment; and parental characteristics. An extensive process evaluation battery was also used to monitor dose delivered by interventionists, completeness of intervention component delivery by teachers, and fidelity of teachers’ implementation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6591" xml_f="6601" txt_i="2172" txt_f="2182">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6612" xml_f="6866" txt_i="2183" txt_f="2437">The study will address important gaps relative to increasing physical activity in preschool children.

To address the low prevalence of meeting physical activity recommendations and lack of evidence regarding physical activity interventions in preschool children in the U.S., we designed the Study of Health and Activity in Preschool Environments (SHAPES) using known activity-promoting characteristics.

SHAPES interventionists employed a flexible and adaptive approach to incorporating physical activity opportunities throughout the entire preschool day. Interventionists worked with teachers (e.g., workshops, on-site consultations) to develop and adapt their own daily activities to their specific classrooms. The goal was to maximize physical activity opportunities throughout the preschool day including outdoor play and classroom activities (e.g., center time, large group activities, pre-academic lessons).

Sixteen schools (eight intervention and eight control) were invited to participate and met the following eligibility criteria: the program was educative in nature and met for at least three hours per day and for 180 days per school year; the curriculum met state standards and focused on developmental and pre-academic skills for preschoolers (e.g., emergent literacy, mathematics, social development). The two major types of schools involved were public and private four-year-old pre-kindergartens and tuition-based programs, most of which were operated by religious or commercial organizations. A stratified random sample of schools meeting the described criteria was drawn and invited to participate in the study. If a preschool declined to participate, a replacement program was selected from the same stratum. Baseline and follow-up data were collected for each school year of the study. The duration of the first intervention year was approximately 15-25 weeks, and the second intervention year was approximately 31 weeks in duration. During the first year of the study, a particular group of students was assessed at baseline and follow-up. During the second year of the study, another cohort (i.e., new students in a particular teacher’s classroom) was assessed at baseline and follow-up; thus, the duration of the intervention at a given preschool was two years, but two separate cohorts were assessed in the measurement protocol (one each year). The study was approved by the University of South Carolina’s Institutional Review Board.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label><offsets xml_i="14009" xml_f="14016" txt_i="8228" txt_f="8235">Table 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="14036" xml_f="14054" txt_i="8235" txt_f="8253">SHAPES logic model</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="14320" xml_f="14331" txt_i="8254" txt_f="8265">     Inputs</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="14385" xml_f="14386" txt_i="8265" txt_f="8266"> </offsets><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="14439" xml_f="14453" txt_i="8266" txt_f="8280">       Outputs</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="14507" xml_f="14508" txt_i="8280" txt_f="8281"> </offsets><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="14561" xml_f="14573" txt_i="8281" txt_f="8293">    Outcomes</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="14642" xml_f="14660" txt_i="8293" txt_f="8311">What we invest and</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="14720" xml_f="14738" txt_i="8311" txt_f="8329">Who is reached and</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="14798" xml_f="14821" txt_i="8329" txt_f="8352">Changes made by “change</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="14881" xml_f="14903" txt_i="8352" txt_f="8374">Organizational changes</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="14963" xml_f="14982" txt_i="8374" txt_f="8393">Individual behavior</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="15051" xml_f="15061" txt_i="8393" txt_f="8403">what we do</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="15121" xml_f="15137" txt_i="8403" txt_f="8419">expected effects</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="15197" xml_f="15218" txt_i="8419" txt_f="8440">agents” (intervention</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="15278" xml_f="15298" txt_i="8440" txt_f="8460">in preschool setting</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="15358" xml_f="15382" txt_i="8460" txt_f="8484">change (activity-related</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th></tr><tr><th align="left"><offsets xml_i="15429" xml_f="15430" txt_i="8484" txt_f="8485"> </offsets></th><th align="left"><offsets xml_i="15452" xml_f="15453" txt_i="8485" txt_f="8486"> </offsets></th><th align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="15481" xml_f="15496" txt_i="8486" txt_f="8501">implementation)</offsets></bold></th><th align="left"><offsets xml_i="15525" xml_f="15526" txt_i="8501" txt_f="8502"> </offsets></th><th align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="15554" xml_f="15564" txt_i="8502" txt_f="8512">behaviors)</offsets></bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><offsets xml_i="15655" xml_f="15786" txt_i="8512" txt_f="8643">SHAPES intervention staff provide training, ongoing assistance, and small amounts of funding (for small equipment and supplies) to…</offsets></td><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><offsets xml_i="15833" xml_f="15938" txt_i="8644" txt_f="8749">Preschool teachers and assistant teachers in 4K classrooms who will carry out the SHAPES intervention by…</offsets></td><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><offsets xml_i="15985" xml_f="16355" txt_i="8750" txt_f="9120">Providing physical education/indoor physical activity for at least 10 minutes per day (“move inside”);

To be eligible for the study, children’s parents must have provided informed consent and indicated that they expected their child to remain enrolled in the same preschool through the end of the current academic year. All parents of children assigned to 4-year-old classrooms in participating preschools were invited to involve their children in the study. Children were excluded from the study if they had a disability that would invalidate accelerometry as a measure of physical activity (e.g., use of wheelchair, employment of a walker) or if they were outside the 3-5 year-old age range. If there were siblings in the sample, data from only one child per family will be used for analyses.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17955" xml_f="17966" txt_i="10513" txt_f="10524">Sample size</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17977" xml_f="18118" txt_i="10525" txt_f="10666">For the first study aim, sample size was calculated based on Murray’s formula for calculating detectable difference of a mixed-model ANCOVA [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="18150" xml_f="18152" txt_i="10666" txt_f="10668">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18159" xml_f="18266" txt_i="10668" txt_f="10775">].

Our team hypothesized that increasing physical activity promoting practices and policies (i.e., instructional and environmental factors) in the preschool classrooms would increase the physical activity levels of preschoolers in these settings. The classroom level changes included providing activity resources, influencing teaching practices, and promoting adjustment of the daily schedule to include additional opportunities for children’s physical activity.

The interventionists also distributed physical activity supplies at this time. Throughout the remainder of the intervention, interventionists offered five workshops, which were held at convenient times for teachers. At each workshop, the SHAPES personnel provided food, additional physical activity equipment, a gift card incentive, and childcare for teachers’ children. The goals of the workshops were to provide teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary for implementation and adaptations of the intervention components. We designed the workshops in a partnership format so that teachers could interact and learn from both interventionists and each other. The intervention personnel chose workshop topics based on their observations of teachers in the field and teachers’ requests for information related to children’s physical activity.

The first model adjusted for the baseline physical activity variable and wave. The second model added demographic variables (i.e., gender, race and parent education). The third model adjusted for whether the school day was half-day (3-4 hours) or total day (6.5 to 7 hours). We used multiple imputation (data augmentation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo generation) to replace missing outcome data for the physical activity variables, height, and weight for the follow-up measure. For the second aim, a mixed-model ANCOVA was used, testing the interaction of group by factor. In all analyses, preschool was treated as a random variable with students nested in school and group (intervention versus control). Eight children with a twin or sibling included in the study were excluded from the analyses.</offsets></p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39021" xml_f="39039" txt_i="29034" txt_f="29052">Process evaluation</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39050" xml_f="40055" txt_i="29053" txt_f="30058">Investigators systematically monitored “dose” delivered by interventionists (i.e., SHAPES trainings, site visits, resources, materials, and other supports), completeness of intervention component delivery by teachers (i.e., teachers’ providing physical activity opportunities through “Move In”, “Move Out”, and “Move to Learn”), and fidelity of teachers’ implementation of SHAPES (i.e., children are active and enjoying physical activity opportunities and teachers are encouraging and participating in physical activity with children). We also assessed preschool practices related to physical activity, teachers’ satisfaction with and dispositions toward training and support activities and intervention components, contextual elements (e.g., classroom physical environments, teacher turnover), and preschool characteristics (e.g., public or private programs, length of preschool days, organizational supports for physical activity).

Many previous investigations have focused on school-age children and have employed single intervention strategies. Additionally, we applied a rigorous measurement protocol that used objective instrumentation to evaluate the effects of the intervention on physical activity and sedentary behavior. Further, and importantly, this study is one of few to extensively conduct process evaluation to provide thorough documentation of the SHAPES intervention implementation.
