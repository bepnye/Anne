Analyses of the effects of albendazole allocation on any category of mortality (or on any other outcomes—eg, faecal egg counts, blood biochemistry, anthropometry, or morbidity) derived only from the 72 block averages for the outcome or explanatory factors of interest, giving all blocks equal weight (as they were of similar size). If albendazole did nothing, the mean of the 36 albendazole block averages would have been the mean of 36 selected randomly from these 72 values.

Sensitivity analyses explored the relevance of not adjusting for infant mortality or of additional adjustment for district (by which randomisation had been stratified).

Assuming approximately 119 (65 male, 54 female) children per AWC at ages 1·0–6·0 years, approximate absolute 5-year risks were calculated as five times (annual deaths per AWC)/(119, 65, or 54, as appropriate). Sensitivity analyses: further inclusion of district (as six indicators) or child population per AWC (which varied little) had no material effect.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl3fn2"><label>†</label><p>Interaction p=0·83.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl3fn3"><label>‡</label><p>6-month mortality had correlation 99·3% with infant mortality and 68·2% with child mortality, so results were unchanged if it was used instead of infant mortality to correct for initial variation in prognosis; without either correction, numbers of child deaths per AWC at ages 1·0–2·9, 3·0–6·0, and 1·0–6·0 years would have been, respectively, 1·80 versus 1·96 (p=0·11), 1·13 versus 1·27 (p=0·031), and 2·92 versus 3·23 (p=0·045); RR=0·90 (0·82–1·00); absolute risks 2·46% versus 2·72%.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl3fn4"><label>§</label><p>Two–sided p=0·16.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><boxed-text id="box1"><label>Panel</label><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p>The recently updated Cochrane Review<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> of previous trials showed that intermittent deworming of school-age children can improve weight gain in some high-prevalence areas. No previous trial was large enough to assess effects on mortality. The present study shows that in a lightly infected rural Indian population routine deworming of pre-school children had little effect on weight gain or on mortality. This finding does not rule out effects of deworming on mortality in other populations, although any such effects are generally likely to be small.</p></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
