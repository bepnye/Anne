The Nintendo Wii console comes packaged with a Wiimote controller, which includes both buttons and motion-sensing functionality. Many action games can be played on the Wii console, but Wii versions of the games generally change the control scheme to include motion control for such actions as aiming a weapon or throwing grenades. It is as yet unclear whether these motions produce greater energy expenditure than typical button presses in traditional games. If motion controllers produce greater energy expenditure than traditional controllers, they could produce positive health impacts at both the individual and public health level.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8324" xml_f="8937" txt_i="3732" txt_f="4345">The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of motion-sensing controllers on energy expenditure during play of games from the action genre.

Whereas Wii Sports encourages large, exaggerated movements such as swinging a tennis racket or punching an opponent, action games require greater precision of movement to ensure success. The game that showed the greatest energy expenditure in this study (Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles) encouraged frequent shooting by offering unlimited ammunition for the default weapon. It may be that the abundance of ammunition (a rarity in action games, which often require management of scarce resources to increase suspense) allowed participants to shoot more often than they did in the other games and, thus, expend more energy. Though Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition, which produced significantly lower energy expenditure than The Umbrella Chronicles, also used motion controls, it required more precise shooting less often and placed a greater emphasis on exploration of the game environment, which did not require player motion. Even if motion controls are added to this genre of game, it may be that the characteristics of the genre itself generally discourage unnecessary movements. </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26148" xml_f="26890" txt_i="19414" txt_f="20156">The game that produced the lowest energy expenditure (traditionally controlled Resident Evil) was also rated less enjoyable than its comparison motion-controlled game as well as the other two traditionally controlled games. This finding was surprising, as Resident Evil is considered a classic game, and the version used (the 2002 Gamecube remake) received extremely high review scores. Enjoyment was also predicted by overall gaming experience and having played the game before in Resident Evil and Medal of Honor games. It is unclear whether previous experience leads to increased enjoyment due to familiarity or if previous play and enjoyment both reflect an underlying variable such as a preference for specific types or series of games. </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26897" xml_f="27238" txt_i="20157" txt_f="20498">A strength of this study was the experimental study design and inclusion of three different pairs of games. To our knowledge, this study was the largest one of motion-controlled gaming yet conducted, with a much larger proportion of female participants (50%) than in past studies. As women represent approximately 40% of video game players [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="27270" xml_f="27272" txt_i="20498" txt_f="20500">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27279" xml_f="27543" txt_i="20500" txt_f="20764">], their inclusion in active gaming studies is important. Participants were randomized to play iterations of the same game using different controllers, eliminating many potential confounding variables related to game content that may have biased previous studies. </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27550" xml_f="28293" txt_i="20765" txt_f="21508">A limitation of the study was that only one of the three pairs included identical games. The other two pairs included games that were chosen to minimize potential confounding variables; however, it was impossible to eliminate them. The pair that produced significant differences in energy expenditure, Resident Evil and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles, was the least similar of the three pairs. The games shared characters, storyline, and setting, but differences in implementation of control scheme may have led to differences in gameplay. Differences in this pair (e.g., more frequent shooting, greater enjoyment), offer insight into possible variables to manipulate in future studies that may produce increases in energy expenditure.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28300" xml_f="28666" txt_i="21509" txt_f="21875">Other limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the data and measurement of only one side of energy balance. It is impossible based on this study design to determine potential effects of game play on subsequent energy intake and expenditure. Play of video games with a traditional controller has been found to increase food consumption after a play session [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"><offsets xml_i="28698" xml_f="28700" txt_i="21875" txt_f="21877">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="28707" xml_f="29194" txt_i="21877" txt_f="22364">]; thus, it is possible that later increases in energy intake could erase the expenditure benefits of motion-controlled action gaming and result in overall positive energy balance. Results should also be generalized with caution due to possible differences between eligible participants who completed the study and those who did not attend their appointment or who were eligible but not asked to participate because recruitment goals (i.e., 100 participants, 50 per gender) were reached.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title><offsets xml_i="29245" xml_f="29259" txt_i="22366" txt_f="22380">5. Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29270" xml_f="30042" txt_i="22381" txt_f="23153">Action video games are extremely popular and are the most widely played genre of video game. Addition of motion controls to this genre of game can produce small increases in energy expended during play. However, only some motion-controlled action games produce greater expenditure than equivalent traditionally controlled games; these games also produce greater energy expenditure than some other motion-controlled games. The manner in which motions are integrated into gameplay likely has a large effect on the amount of energy expenditure than can be expected during play. Though motion-controlled action games may not lead to changes in the intensity of physical activity, their potential for reducing risk associated with sedentary behavior should not be overlooked.  </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30049" xml_f="30911" txt_i="23154" txt_f="24016">Little is currently known about the impact of motion-controlled games on sedentary behavior and physical activity over time. Even less is known about the impact of these games on other behaviors that may be associated with obesity and other negative health outcomes, such as snacking during screen time. There is a particular need for investigation of game characteristics that encourage or discourage movement even in highly similar games, such as the two motion-controlled Resident Evil games played in this study that produced significantly different energy expenditure levels. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to investigate the potential of games to contribute to obesity prevention and treatment; even games that do not increase moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity may improve health by decreasing prolonged bouts of sedentary behavior.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec6"><title><offsets xml_i="30962" xml_f="30984" txt_i="24018" txt_f="24040"> Conflict of Interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="30995" xml_f="31053" txt_i="24041" txt_f="24099">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec7"><title><offsets xml_i="31104" xml_f="31128" txt_i="24101" txt_f="24125"> Authors' Contributions </offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31139" xml_f="31535" txt_i="24126" txt_f="24522">E.
