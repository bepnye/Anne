A total of 497 eligible children were enrolled in the trial and randomised between the treatment groups. This was a smaller number than predicted, because of lower rainfall than in previous seasons, and thus reduced malaria transmission. The reason for ineligibility was recorded for 82% of non-recruits. These were: residence outside the study area (26.1%), parasitaemia below the threshold (16.5%), consent withheld (15.9%), anaemia (PCV below 20%) (7.6%), participation in another research study (4.4%), recent antimalarial use (3.8%), hyperparasitaemia (2.9%), other signs of severe malaria (1.6%), vomiting (0.7%), other disease present (0.6%) and other reasons not included in the above (19.9%).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29815" xml_f="29948" txt_i="19783" txt_f="19916">Ninety-one children received CQ/SP and 406 received co-artemether.

In the co-artemether group, none of the ten children who carried gametocytes at day 7 and donated blood for membrane-feeding of mosquitoes was found to be infectious. In contrast, 7 (36.9%) of the 19 gametocyte donors in the CQ/SP group were infectious, largely due to a significantly higher gametocyte density than in the co-artemether group. This suggests that co-artemether has a specific action against developing gametocytes, as any gametocytes that appeared on or before day 7 must have been committed to sexual differentiation at the time of treatment, because of the period of 8â10 d of sequestered sexual development that occurs before gametocytes are detectable in the periphery [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0020092-b26" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="41299" xml_f="41301" txt_i="28993" txt_f="28995">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41308" xml_f="41961" txt_i="28995" txt_f="29648">].

From a public health point of view, the effect of each regimen on all children presenting for treatment, including gametocyte carriers, is of interest. In co-artemether-treated children who had unidentified circulating gametocytes at recruitment, seven of 20 (29.2%) carried gametocytes at 7 d, compared to 13 of 312 (4.2%) of those without circulating gametocytes at the time of treatment (Fisher's exact test, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="45148" xml_f="45149" txt_i="32285" txt_f="32286">p</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="45158" xml_f="45707" txt_i="32286" txt_f="32832"> &lt; 0.01).

These gametocytes and their asexual progenitors have been under sustained drug selection, given the elimination half-lives of CQ, des-ethylchloroquine (an active metabolite of CQ), sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine: 5.9 d, 8.5 d, 10.9 d, and 2.9 d, respectively when given simultaneously as CQ/SP [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0020092-b28" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46382" xml_f="46384" txt_i="33456" txt_f="33458">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46391" xml_f="46495" txt_i="33458" txt_f="33562">].

Thus, parasites detected in co-artemether-treated children during follow-up have, on average, experienced a shorter period of selective drug pressure than those in CQ/SP-treated children.

However, as seen with artemisinins in other areas of moderate to high malaria transmission, co-artemether has the disadvantage of permitting rapid re-infection, which can lead to new clinical attacks. This is due to absence of the prophylactic effect afforded by a pharmacological âtail,â such as that seen with both SP and CQ. From our co-artemether data, the 28 d new infection rate in our study population is approximately 10% with fewer than a fifth of these experiencing a new clinical attack. Although this reinfection/clinical infection rate may be even higher in other settings, we believe it would be offset by the ability of co-artemether to reduce selection and transmission of drug resistant parasites, and thus make possible sustainable improvements in both therapeutic and public health outcomes. In contrast, as our data show, the pharmacological persistence of CQ and SP eliminates sensitive parasites emerging from the liver, and so permits a much smaller proportion of new infections (3.5%). We predict that CQ/SP thus selects for any resistant mutants present in the starting population, leading to increased onward transmission of resistant parasites, and reduced onward transmission of sensitive parasites.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48544" xml_f="49334" txt_i="35495" txt_f="36285">There are difficulties with the introduction of co-artemether as a first-line treatment for malaria in Africa. Firstly, as the six-dose regimen is the most likely to provide the treatment and transmission-reducing benefits needed, there may be problems with treatment compliance. Secondly, the requirement of oily food for adequate absorption may lead to inadequate drug levels in the blood of many treated individuals. Effectiveness studies that examine these indicators under conditions as close as possible to the normal clinical setting, and with both therapeutic and transmission endpoints, are thus of great importance. Nevertheless, the therapeutic success of co-artemether as a front-line treatment policy has been demonstrated in KwaZuluâNatal, South Africa, where it replaced SP [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0020092-b31" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="49379" xml_f="49381" txt_i="36285" txt_f="36287">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49388" xml_f="49487" txt_i="36287" txt_f="36386">].
