The priority in both treatment arms was to maintain lung volume by first weaning FiO2 to &lt; 0.60 after which mean airway pressure and FiO2 were given equal priority for reduction.

CDP was not decreased until FiO2 &lt; 0.60 was feasible applying the general physiological targets mentioned earlier.

Measurements were made day 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the study. Peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume per ideal bodyweight were measured in high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) after crossover to conventional mechanical ventilation (CV). Values are presented as means with standard deviations. <sup>a</sup>Higher mean airway pressures in HFOV compared with CV (p = 0.03). <sup>b</sup>Significantly lower pH in patients that cross over in the CV group (p = 0.017). <sup>c</sup>Higher OI in patients that crossed over compared with patients that did not cross over (p = 0.07 and p = 0.05, respectively). FiO2, fraction of inspired oxygen; paCO2, pressure of arterial carbon dioxide; paO2, pressure of arterial oxygen; SaO2, arterial oxygen saturation.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></back></article>
