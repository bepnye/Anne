Thus, it is unlikely that the higher scores in the intervention group are attributable to self-selection. Although there was a significant difference between the groups in proportions of students who did a self-study for the OSCE, which might have caused the results of no difference in most of the skills, the other characteristics such as age and gender were similarly distributed (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="22177" xml_f="22178" txt_i="14394" txt_f="14395">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22185" xml_f="22415" txt_i="14395" txt_f="14625">).

First, our teaching method was based on the research findings in Western world, and this is based on the untested assumption that these findings are equally valid in Japan. There is evidence that patient-physician communication patterns in Japan are different from those in the West. Previous research by Ohtaki and colleagues compared patient-physician communication patterns in Japan and the USA [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><offsets xml_i="23517" xml_f="23519" txt_i="15534" txt_f="15536">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23526" xml_f="24227" txt_i="15536" txt_f="16237">]. It included 20 outpatient consultations of four physicians in Japan and 20 outpatient consultations of five physicians in the USA. Japanese physicians spent less time on social talk than the USA counterparts (5% vs. 12%). Japanese patient-physician encounters included more pauses than those in the USA (30% vs. 8.2% of the total consultation length). There is a need for more empirical studies linking physicians' communication skills to patient outcomes specifically for Japanese population. Second, our assessment of students' communication skills was based on observations of a single, five-minute OSCE station. The reliability of which as a measure of communication skills is known to be low [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="24259" xml_f="24261" txt_i="16237" txt_f="16239">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24268" xml_f="24961" txt_i="16239" txt_f="16932">]. Third, because we assessed the students' skills at only one time, we could not assess the change in students' performance before and after the intervention. Fourth, the use of junior students as standardized patients may have influenced the performance of the examinees. The accuracy of student-standardized-patients' (student-SPs') portrayal would be a critical issue especially when the OSCE is used to grade students. Although we did not objectively investigate the consistencies of the portrayal by student-SPs, our examinees rated highly the fidelity of student-SPs, i.e., the degree to which they were acting as if they were real patients (mean score, 3.9 on a 5-point Likert scale) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="24993" xml_f="24995" txt_i="16932" txt_f="16934">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25002" xml_f="25829" txt_i="16934" txt_f="17761">]. Fifth, our study might have only shown that the intervention was effective in improving students' skills for eliciting 'expert' observations of patient perspectives, not actual patient perspectives. We did not ask student-SPs whether examinees elicited their perspectives. Rather, we judged examinees' ability to elicit patient perspectives through their 'observable' behaviours from the experts' point of view. The role of student-SPs in evaluating fellow students' communication skills, particularly skills for eliciting patient perspectives should be addressed in future studies. Finally, the statistically significant difference observed for only 1 skill among a total of 16 skills could be due to chance alone. It is certainly possible that our intervention was too weak to influence any of the 16 communication skills.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25836" xml_f="27569" txt_i="17762" txt_f="19495">One can hypothesize the reasons why the intervention appeared to make a difference to some communication skills competencies but not to others. One could speculate that the competencies that were not influenced by the intervention were either very easy in general or too difficult to acquire in such a short teaching session. For example, the skills for establishing initial rapport (greet patient and obtain the patient's name, introduce self and clarify roles) and skills for determining the patient's chief concern (ask closed-ended questions that are non-leading and one at a time, define the concern completely) may be already present from the outset or so easy to acquire that a self-study just before the OSCE would make no differences in scores between the groups regardless of the intervention. On the other hand, the skills for surveying the patient's reason(s) for the visit, which requires being open at the beginning of the interview, may be too difficult for students to demonstrate, with or without the intervention. In particular, only 9% in the intervention group and 6% in the control group demonstrated an acceptable performance for the skills of allowing patients to complete their opening statements. These very low scores may also indicate that during small group sessions, we did not emphasize enough the importance of not interrupting patients at the beginning of the interview. Another explanation is that 'content' skills (i.e., what we communicate) are easier for students to acquire than 'process' skills (i.e., how we communicate). Kurtz at al. noted that the skills for understanding patient's perspectives, which our intervention made a difference, are actually 'content' skills, not 'process' skills [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="27601" xml_f="27603" txt_i="19495" txt_f="19497">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27610" xml_f="27774" txt_i="19497" txt_f="19661">]. One could argue that the intervention was just too short to influence other 'process' skills. These interesting hypotheses should require further investigations.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="27796" xml_f="27807" txt_i="19663" txt_f="19674">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27818" xml_f="28360" txt_i="19675" txt_f="20217">The results of this study suggest that a short, intensive small group seminar for Japanese medical students may have had an impact on specific communication skills, namely, skills for exploring how the illness or problem affected the patient's life, asking the patient about ideas concerning the illness or problem, and being attentive and empathic nonverbally at least in the short term. Further studies should be done to confirm this preliminary finding and to clarify the skills for which educational interventions could make a difference.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28382" xml_f="28401" txt_i="20219" txt_f="20238">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28412" xml_f="28472" txt_i="20239" txt_f="20299">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28494" xml_f="28516" txt_i="20301" txt_f="20323">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28527" xml_f="28703" txt_i="20324" txt_f="20500">KM contributed to the conception and design of the study, design and implementation of the educational intervention, interpretation of the data, and drafting of the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28710" xml_f="28794" txt_i="20501" txt_f="20585">KK and KW contributed to the collection of the data and reviewing of the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28801" xml_f="28878" txt_i="20586" txt_f="20663">KA contributed to the collection of the data and reviewing of the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28885" xml_f="29015" txt_i="20664" txt_f="20794">JS contributed to the conception and design of the study, analysis and interpretation of the data and reviewing of the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29022" xml_f="29199" txt_i="20795" txt_f="20972">NB contributed to the conception and design of the study, design and implementation of the educational intervention, interpretation of the data, and reviewing of the manuscript.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="29221" xml_f="29244" txt_i="20974" txt_f="20997">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29255" xml_f="29319" txt_i="20998" txt_f="21062">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6920/4/24/prepub"></ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank students who participated in the study.
