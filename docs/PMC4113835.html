For all participants, the back fatigue/discomfort was no longer present by the second week of the intervention. The major complaint regarding the SSDs from usability perspective was the loss of work-surface compared to traditional sitting desk.

Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27934" xml_f="28474" txt_i="17651" txt_f="18191">In this study sedentary office workers were asked to replace 50% of their sitting time during work with standing by the use of sit-stand workstations over the course of four weeks. The objective MSR accelerometer measure estimated 21% absolute decrease in sitting time, which translates into a decrease of 8 h of sitting during a 40 h work week. The estimate that included sitting time for non-work hours (evenings and weekends) suggested that the participants were not sitting more at home to compensate for the increased standing at work.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28481" xml_f="29707" txt_i="18192" txt_f="19418">Activity during work hours was significantly higher during the intervention than during the control period as measured by the Gruve accelerometer. Participants did not compensate for higher amounts of activity during work hours by being less active during non-work hours. One reason the total activity was not significantly increased during the intervention may be that the increase in movement that comes from using sit-stand workstations is in the light activity spectrum of low MET values, and thus it would be difficult to accurately detect such differences in low intensity non-sedentary activity. The Gruve accelerometer detects walking down to a speed of 0.5 mph, however, the shift from sitting to standing at a workstation probably includes ample periods of movement that are below this threshold. Thus, even though prolonged sedentariness is being disrupted by use of SSDs, total PA changes may not be detected. The fact that prolonged sedentary time was being disrupted as a result of the present intervention is clear when the accelerometer data are broken down into the more meaningful activity spectrum which demonstrated that participants replaced about 38 min of sedentary time per day with non-sedentary time.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29714" xml_f="30183" txt_i="19419" txt_f="19888">One of the most interesting findings from this study is that installation of SSDs—which allows people to replace sitting with standing—is effective at increasing not only standing time, but also light movement during work-hours. The findings of this study are similar to the few previous studies on this topic.

However, the effect sizes were small and the interpretation of their meaning will depend on future studies. Still, one would only expect a subtle effect on the mood of a person during work due to the implementation of a sit-stand workstation. Feeling more energetic and less tired is somewhat counter-intuitive since standing may be more physically demanding than sitting. However, physiologic studies suggest a biological basis to increased feelings of energy and well-being from replacing some sitting time with standing. Standing, compared to sitting, recruits more muscle fibers and stimulates blood flow, which may help with alertness and maintaining energy levels and focus on certain work tasks and office interactions [</offsets><xref rid="B7-ijerph-11-06653" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="31749" xml_f="31750" txt_i="21236" txt_f="21237">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31757" xml_f="31760" txt_i="21237" txt_f="21240">]. </offsets></p><p><xref rid="B24-ijerph-11-06653" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="31815" xml_f="31817" txt_i="21241" txt_f="21243">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31824" xml_f="32023" txt_i="21243" txt_f="21442">].

First, like most lifestyle interventions, the intervention could not be blinded. Investigators were also not blinded. However, the primary outcome was measured objectively with accelerometers, which should minimize bias. Sample size was small and intervention was short; however, use of a cross-over design significantly improved statistical power in this study. As with all cross-over intervention studies, bias can occur due to order (whether intervention was applied first or control was applied first), period (time of the year, seasonality, during when intervention or control was applied), and carry-over/contamination (carrying over of benefits or harms from one period to next) effects. The study design sought to minimize these effects through randomization of the order (intervention in 1st or 2nd period), adjustment for period and order in the statistical analysis, and implementation of a two-week ‘washout’ between periods to minimize carry-over effects. </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34753" xml_f="35300" txt_i="24021" txt_f="24568">Future studies should include well-powered, long-term, randomized controlled trials with parallel design in various worksite settings.
