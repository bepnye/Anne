Observational studies had suggested that long term use of estrogen was likely to be associated, amongst other things, with reduced risks of osteoporosis and ischaemic heart disease and increased risks of breast and endometrial cancer. Concomitant use of progestogens had been shown to protect against endometrial cancer, but there were few data showing how progestogen might affect estrogen actions on other conditions. Disease specific risks from observational studies suggested that, overall, long-term HRT was likely to be beneficial. Several studies showed that mortality from all causes was lower in HRT users than in non-users. Some secondary cardiovascular prevention trials were ongoing but evidence was also required for a range of outcomes in healthy women. The WISDOM trial was designed to compare combined estrogen and progestogen versus placebo, and estrogen alone versus combined estrogen and progestogen. During the development of WISDOM the Women's Health Initiative trial was designed, funded and started in the US.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4443" xml_f="4449" txt_i="1234" txt_f="1240">Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4460" xml_f="4499" txt_i="1241" txt_f="1280">Randomised, placebo, controlled, trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="4540" xml_f="4547" txt_i="1282" txt_f="1289">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4558" xml_f="5240" txt_i="1290" txt_f="1972">The trial was set in general practices in the UK (384), Australia (94), and New Zealand (24).

Feasibility studies piloting several designs, and overseen by an MRC Working Party, were undertaken by the MRC General Practice Research Framework, starting in the UK in March 1990 and in Ireland and the Netherlands, partly funded by the European Union (EU) Framework Biomedical and Health Research Programme, in 1992.

We submitted a protocol for a full scale trial to the MRC in early 1993. The design incorporated comparison of two types of estrogen and two types of progestogen in recently menopausal women and required international co-operation both to recruit and to fund the trial. To reduce costs the MRC Working Party recommended including women from age 50 to 64 years, so that events could be accrued more quickly, and limiting the comparisons to one estrogen and one progestogen. An MRC Trial Development Group was set up to consider ways of refining the protocol, thus reducing the scale and the cost of the proposed trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10454" xml_f="10582" txt_i="5851" txt_f="5979">Meanwhile, the US Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial using the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) trial [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="10613" xml_f="10614" txt_i="5979" txt_f="5980">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10621" xml_f="10690" txt_i="5980" txt_f="6049">] as evidence of feasibility was fully funded and began recruitment [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35"><offsets xml_i="10722" xml_f="10724" txt_i="6049" txt_f="6051">35</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10731" xml_f="10951" txt_i="6051" txt_f="6271">].

Wyeth Ayerst US was the only company willing to provide active and placebo medication. This was the same estrogen and progestogen as used in the WHI trial plus matched placebo. It took almost three years for a decision to fund the UK component of WISDOM to be reached because the cost was high and many menopause clinicians opposed the trial, claiming that the cardiovascular benefit was proven, the effect on breast cancer over-estimated and the results with CEE and MPA unlikely to be relevant to clinical practice ten years hence. We submitted a business case for the trial showing that as long as the trial gave a clear answer to the question of balance of risks and benefits costs were justified. MRC conducted an extensive independent international peer review including a separate review looking at the future relevance of results with CEE and MPA. Funding of £21 million for the UK component in 18,000 women was agreed in August 1996.

This paper describes the protocol for the trial, the difficulties encountered in recruiting at the expected rate and changes made to increase the rate of recruitment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="15139" xml_f="15184" txt_i="10156" txt_f="10201">Evidence emerging since the closure of WISDOM</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="15195" xml_f="15338" txt_i="10202" txt_f="10345">The WHI reported that combined HRT did not appear to protect against development of dementia in women who entered the trial over age 65 years [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40"><offsets xml_i="15370" xml_f="15372" txt_i="10345" txt_f="10347">40</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15379" xml_f="15480" txt_i="10347" txt_f="10448">] and had no clinically meaningful effect on health related quality of life in postmenopausal women [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41"><offsets xml_i="15512" xml_f="15514" txt_i="10448" txt_f="10450">41</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15521" xml_f="15621" txt_i="10450" txt_f="10550">].

In July 2001, once sufficient data on which to comment on generalisability had been obtained from the eligible population, the full note search of every woman eligible for the trial was replaced by a quicker eligibility check.

Incidence rates for hip fracture were estimated using figures from the European Report on Osteoporosis, 1998. No trend figures were available and no trend was assumed. Rates were reduced by 20% for a healthy volunteer effect. At the end of the 5 year post treatment follow-up period, 27 hip fractures per 1000 women recruited would be expected. Based on published data the risk ratio was estimated as 0.7 in the first year on treatment, 0.6 for second year, 0.5 for years 3 – 10, gradually increasing back to 1 after treatment ends. This would give an expected reduction in events of 26% from 27 per 1000, to 20 per 1000 women recruited. The sample size of 23000 would be able to detect only a larger reduction in hip fractures of 36% with 80% power at the 5% level of significance. We therefore looked at all osteoporotic fractures. As there were no UK incidence rates available for all osteoporotic fractures we assumed the same ratio between hip and all osteoporotic fractures as in US. Rates were reduced by 20% for a healthy volunteer effect. At the end of 5 year post treatment follow-up period, 95 fractures per 1000 women recruited would be expected. Assuming the risk ratio for all fractures was similar to that for hip fractures a 28% decrease in event rate at 5 year follow-up would be expected.

In estimating the trial event rate for breast cancer it was assumed that no further increase would occur. Incidence rates were adjusted down by 10% to allow for the fact that those with near relatives having had breast cancer were unlikely to enter the trial. No other healthy volunteer effect was allowed for. With these assumptions, the expected trial event rate for breast cancer at the end of the 5 year post treatment follow-up period was 36 per 1000 women entered. With a sample size of 23000 it would be possible to detect a 40% increase from a placebo event rate of 36/1000 women-years. This was much higher than the expected increased risk; observational studies suggested that the risk ratio increased by 2.3% for each year on treatment and reduced by the same amount after treatment ends. This would give an expected 11% increase in event rate at 5 years follow-up, an increase from 36 per 1000 women to 40 per 1000 women recruited.

A further six years elapsed from the start of the commissioned pilot studies in 1990, to the release of funding for the main trial, despite the demonstration by early 1993 that the trial was feasible in the UK and other European countries. The factors contributing to the delay were understandable concerns about cost, but also opposition by many UK clinicians and scientists working in the menopause area on the grounds that the risk benefit profile of HRT had clearly been shown to be favourable by observational studies.

A decision was made to collect data directly on to laptop computers and download to the co-ordinating centre and to undertake all the design and programming in house. We aimed for technical perfection and the system eventually incorporated a sophisticated real time patient management program and was the prototype for data collection in other trials in the MRC GPRF. This worked extremely well and was one of the success stories of the trial, but it resulted in a tendency to agree to collect data on more and more outcomes of interest for additional sub-studies in order to explore fully the potential risks and benefits of HRT. WISDOM would have progressed more rapidly if we had restricted data collection to the main outcomes and had devolved more of the decisions about individual patient care to the clinicians at the participating sites.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="63907" xml_f="64693" txt_i="55654" txt_f="56440">During the six years delay between the application for funding in 1993 and the start of recruitment in 1999 women's use of and perceptions about HRT had changed and UK general practice had been re-organised. This impacted on the trial in that the window of opportunity for rapid recruitment had been lost. Though new strategies were proving successful and have since been used in other trials, recruitment was slower and more costly than anticipated. While it is unlikely that, had WISDOM recruited a greater proportion of its target before the WHI results were published, closure could have been avoided, younger, more recently post-menopausal women would have been included (the strategy was to recruit older age groups first) adding new information not available from the WHI trials.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="64700" xml_f="65353" txt_i="56441" txt_f="57094">The WISDOM experience leads to some simple messages.

When a trial is very costly and beyond the resources of one country, funders and investigators should make efforts to develop international collaboration with joint funding. If it is not feasible to undertake the optimum design because of lack of funds, investigators should be sure that a compromise design, recommended by funders, really does address the key questions posed.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="65375" xml_f="65388" txt_i="57096" txt_f="57109">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65405" xml_f="65409" txt_i="57110" txt_f="57114">APC </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65416" xml_f="65435" txt_i="57114" txt_f="57133">Activated protein C</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65448" xml_f="65452" txt_i="57134" txt_f="57138">CEE </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65459" xml_f="65485" txt_i="57138" txt_f="57164">Conjugated equine estrogen</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65498" xml_f="65502" txt_i="57165" txt_f="57169">ERT </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65509" xml_f="65537" txt_i="57169" txt_f="57197">Estrogen replacement therapy</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65550" xml_f="65553" txt_i="57198" txt_f="57201">EU </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65560" xml_f="65574" txt_i="57201" txt_f="57215">European Union</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65587" xml_f="65591" txt_i="57216" txt_f="57220">HRT </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65598" xml_f="65625" txt_i="57220" txt_f="57247">Hormone replacement therapy</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65638" xml_f="65643" txt_i="57248" txt_f="57253">cHRT </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65650" xml_f="65687" txt_i="57253" txt_f="57290">combined estrogen and progestogen HRT</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65700" xml_f="65705" txt_i="57291" txt_f="57296">GPRF </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65712" xml_f="65747" txt_i="57296" txt_f="57331">General Practice Research Framework</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65760" xml_f="65764" txt_i="57332" txt_f="57336">IHD </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65771" xml_f="65794" txt_i="57336" txt_f="57359">Ischaemic heart disease</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65807" xml_f="65811" txt_i="57360" txt_f="57364">MPA </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65818" xml_f="65845" txt_i="57364" txt_f="57391">Medroxyprogesterone acetate</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65858" xml_f="65862" txt_i="57392" txt_f="57396">MRC </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65869" xml_f="65893" txt_i="57396" txt_f="57420">Medical Research Council</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65906" xml_f="65911" txt_i="57421" txt_f="57426">PERT </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65918" xml_f="65962" txt_i="57426" txt_f="57470">Progestogen and estrogen replacement therapy</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="65975" xml_f="65982" txt_i="57471" txt_f="57478">WISDOM </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="65989" xml_f="66059" txt_i="57478" txt_f="57548">Women's International Study Of long-Duration Oestrogen after Menopause</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="66072" xml_f="66076" txt_i="57549" txt_f="57553">WHI </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="66083" xml_f="66108" txt_i="57553" txt_f="57578">Women's Health Initiative</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="66130" xml_f="66149" txt_i="57580" txt_f="57599">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="66160" xml_f="66215" txt_i="57600" txt_f="57655">The author(s) declare they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="66237" xml_f="66259" txt_i="57657" txt_f="57679">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="66270" xml_f="66815" txt_i="57680" txt_f="58225">MRV designed the main trial based on feasibility studies, led, was responsible for, the development of the protocol, had overall responsibility for the trial and drafted the paper.
