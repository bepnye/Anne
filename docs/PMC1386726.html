Even longer follow-up, in a much larger sample, would be needed to detect any positive effects on fracture incidence. We chose not to have an intervention group receiving BMD feedback alone without any other educational intervention. This decision was made because previous studies involving BMD feedback affecting behaviour had included leaflet information [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="34914" xml_f="34915" txt_i="28255" txt_f="28256">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34922" xml_f="34923" txt_i="28256" txt_f="28257">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="34955" xml_f="34957" txt_i="28257" txt_f="28259">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34964" xml_f="35547" txt_i="28259" txt_f="28842">] and there was therefore an argument that supplying a minimal amount of information would be the minimum intervention that would be acceptable both practically and ethically. While this limits the ability to state categorically which effects were due to the BMD feedback and which the leaflet, the variability between T-score subgroups suggests that BMD feedback was the more important component of the intervention. This is consistent with the results of the only randomized controlled trial of written information alone, which found no changes in behaviour from the intervention [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><offsets xml_i="35579" xml_f="35581" txt_i="28842" txt_f="28844">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35588" xml_f="36150" txt_i="28844" txt_f="29406">]. We performed additional analysis by intention to treat to assess the likelihood of loss to follow-up influencing these results, and found that the observed associations remained and were not materially different in magnitude. Lastly, to ensure the effects seen were not confounded by treatment for osteoporosis, we performed the analysis omitting the those subjects known to have been treated as well as those subjects whose T-score would have qualified them for treatment, i.e. less than -2.5 at any site. This did not substantially alter the study findings.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="36172" xml_f="36182" txt_i="29408" txt_f="29418">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36193" xml_f="36603" txt_i="29419" txt_f="29829">Individualized BMD feedback combined with a minimal educational intervention is effective at increasing hip but not spine bone density in premenopausal women. The changes in behavior through which this was mediated are potentially important in the prevention of other diseases, thus measuring bone density at a young age may have substantial public health benefits, particularly if these changes are sustained.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="36625" xml_f="36644" txt_i="29831" txt_f="29850">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36655" xml_f="36715" txt_i="29851" txt_f="29911">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="36737" xml_f="36759" txt_i="29913" txt_f="29935">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36770" xml_f="37515" txt_i="29936" txt_f="30681">GJ was involved in study design, supervised fieldwork and was involved in drafting the manuscript.
