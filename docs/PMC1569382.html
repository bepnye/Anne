Death typically occurs during a narrow time window after admission and before antimalarial treatments can start working. Acidosis (excessive acidity of the blood) is thought to predict death, but it is not clear how acidosis arises. One possibility is that hypovolemia (lowered blood fluid volume) is important, which would normally require urgent resuscitation with fluids. However, there is little evidence on what type of fluid should be given. In the trial reported here, carried out in Kenya's Kilifi District Hospital between 2004 and 2006, 88 children admitted with severe malaria were assigned to receive either albumin solution (a colloid solution made from blood protein) or Gelofusine (a synthetic colloid). The primary outcomes that the researchers were interested in were correction of shock and acidosis in the blood after 8 h. However, the researchers also looked at death rate in hospital and adverse events after treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9352" xml_f="9353" txt_i="3866" txt_f="3867">

However, they did see a difference in death rates between children given Gelofusine and those given albumin. Death rates in hospital were lower in the group given albumin, and this was statistically significant. The researchers then combined the data on death rates from this trial with data from two other trials with an albumin arm. This combined analysis also supported the suggestion that death rates with albumin were lower than with other fluids, either Gelofusine or salt solution.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10096" xml_f="10097" txt_i="4591" txt_f="4592">

The results from this trial indicate that further research is a priority. However, the actual findings from this trial must be tested in larger trials that recruit enough children to establish reliably whether there is a difference in death rate between albumin treatment and treatment with other fluids. This trial was not originally planned to find a clinically relevant difference in death rate, and therefore does not definitively answer that question. Further trials would also need to use a random method to assign participants to the different treatments, rather than alternate blocks (as in this trial). A random method ensures greater comparability of the two groups in the trial, and reduces the chance of selection bias (where assignment of patients to different treatments can be distorted during the enrollment process).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11104" xml_f="11105" txt_i="5580" txt_f="5581">

We therefore aimed to provide data on the safety and efficacy of a non-albumin colloid treatment for shock and correction of acidosis. A secondary objective was to establish whether a similar survival benefit could be achieved using a cheaper non-albumin colloidal solution to guide the selection of resuscitation fluids for inclusion in a phase III trial.

Small trials are susceptible to imbalance in admission characteristics, prognostic markers, and, in trials of volume expansion, volumes administered. These random fluctuations may be further exaggerated in an open, non-randomised trial without concealment of participant allocation to interventions. The albumin and Gelofusine groups were well matched in terms of baseline and prognostic variables and volumes received. However, the primary outcome was resolution of shock, assessed clinically, which may be influenced by clinician bias or affected by the administration of equal volumes of intervention fluids whose colloid oncotic properties may not be equivalent in terms of volume expansion. Nevertheless, we found that most fatalities in the Gelofusine arm were neurological in origin, rather than a result of cardiovascular collapse, which would be more usual if shock were inadequately corrected. Despite the limitations of the trial design, our main finding of a difference in mortality, for which the major prognostic factor at admission is coma, is less likely to be affected by our trial design.

Albumin may act to improve microvascular perfusion in malaria through its rheological effects as well as by volume expansion and influencing fluid shifts across the endothelium.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47796" xml_f="48506" txt_i="35270" txt_f="35980">The three studies we have undertaken, including a meta-analysis, point to a dramatic effect of albumin on the outcome of severe malaria in children, and a clear benefit as compared with other fluids, and suggest that further evaluation of albumin in children with severe malaria, in large phase III studies, is now needed. The comparable mortality of Gelofusine treatment with that of saline observed in our previous studies suggests that inclusion of an additional synthetic colloid arm is unwarranted, as the increase trial size necessitated by a four-arm trial (albumin, saline, Gelofusine, and maintenance-only control) is not justified by the small possibility that Gelofusine may be preferable to saline.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48513" xml_f="49422" txt_i="35981" txt_f="36890">In addition to efficacy and safety, cost and availability of fluids are important issues. While the roll out of costly antiretroviral drugs in sub-Saharan Africa has been justified on the basis of the scale of the HIV epidemic, any decision to make albumin widely available would also require an in-depth cost-effectiveness analysis. Setting aside the possible effects of albumin on decreasing the length of hospital stays and reducing the costs and risks to patients from transfusions, and its potential effect on neurological sequelae, a “back of the envelope” calculation suggests that albumin would be highly cost effective, at around US$30–50 per life saved at current prices. Relevant, but often overlooked, is the cost of a blood transfusion, estimated at US$30 in most localities, which is very commonly and inappropriately prescribed in such cases, despite concerns about its microbiological safety [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010021-b038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="49468" xml_f="49470" txt_i="36890" txt_f="36892">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49477" xml_f="49779" txt_i="36892" txt_f="37194">]. Furthermore, if albumin were shown in future trials to result in significant benefit, then most African countries already have the infrastructure within large regional transfusion units to produce a microbiologically safe albumin at low cost if fairly simple and robust technologies are introduced [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010021-b039" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="49825" xml_f="49827" txt_i="37194" txt_f="37196">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49834" xml_f="50316" txt_i="37196" txt_f="37678">]. Paradoxically, albumin, rather than other synthetic colloids, would then represent the cheapest and most readily available colloid. What is currently missing is the scientific evidence and imperative to justify introduction of these technologies. Moreover, improving childhood survival through the application of evidence-based simple therapies such as volume resuscitation will have benefits beyond the boundaries of severe malaria because of improvements in childhood survival.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title><offsets xml_i="50386" xml_f="50408" txt_i="37681" txt_f="37703">SUPPORTING INFORMATION</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010021-sd001"><label><offsets xml_i="50497" xml_f="50514" txt_i="37704" txt_f="37721">CONSORT Checklist</offsets></label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010021.sd001.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="50577" xml_f="50613" txt_i="37721" txt_f="37757">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media><p><offsets xml_i="50638" xml_f="50649" txt_i="37758" txt_f="37769">(42 KB DOC)</offsets></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010021-sd002"><label><offsets xml_i="50759" xml_f="50773" txt_i="37770" txt_f="37784">Trial Protocol</offsets></label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010021.sd002.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="50836" xml_f="50872" txt_i="37784" txt_f="37820">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media><p><offsets xml_i="50897" xml_f="50909" txt_i="37821" txt_f="37833">(150 KB DOC)</offsets></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010021-sd003"><label><offsets xml_i="51019" xml_f="51026" txt_i="37834" txt_f="37841">Text S1</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="51050" xml_f="51058" txt_i="37841" txt_f="37849">Appendix</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="51069" xml_f="51080" txt_i="37850" txt_f="37861">(21 KB DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0010021.sd003.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="51149" xml_f="51185" txt_i="37862" txt_f="37898">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are indebted to the medical, nursing, and other staff on the high dependency unit at Kilifi District Hospital for their dedication and hard work.
