Ten practices in the first intervention arm will complete the SCOPE questionnaire and are expected to draw and implement their own improvement initiatives based on a computerised feedback report. In the second intervention arm, staff of the ten practices also will be asked to complete the SCOPE questionnaire and in addition will be given a complementary workshop. This workshop is theoretical and interactive, educating staff and facilitating discussion, leading to a practice specific action plan for patient safety improvement. The results of the SCOPE questionnaire are incorporated in the workshop. The ten practices in the control arm continue care as usual. Baseline and follow-up measurements will be conducted with an implementation period of one year. The primary outcome will include the number of incidents reported and secondary several quality and safety indicators and the patient safety culture.

When this is 75 percent or higher it is perceived as a “strong” dimension. When this percentage is lower than 50 percent it is perceived as a “weak” dimension and, when scored in between it is “neutral”. The eight dimensions, the percentage positive scores and their classification are presented in a table. Subsequently, all complete dimensions with all questions are reported. Per question the average practice score is reported and compared with an overall benchmark mean that is calculated from data of all practices that have completed the SCOPE questionnaire in 2008 (n = 506-587). When a question scores more than fifteen percent lower than this mean it is depicted red and when higher green. By this, practices can inform themselves on their performance being average, below or above, as compared to the benchmark average.

Suggestions are not fully worked out, but address some issues and refer to more reading material and organizations that can be consulted, if desired.

The second feature, the trainer being a GP, may allow more rapidly gaining a certain level of understanding and trust among the participants because of being familiar with the GP’s practice and context. We believe that the content of the workshop will be better conveyed when explained by a GP. In addition, as the dialogues can contain intimate content, for example when discussing an incident or flaws in communication between staff, a GP as trainer may be easier to confide in and can also display more understanding of the situation. The researcher attending the workshop gives the opportunity to observe and gather research data.

The SCOPE Intervention Study is one of the first studies that examines the effect of an intervention in primary care on patient safety behaviour and culture. Moreover, the design, a controlled trial, will provide more trustworthy results than previous studies which were observational. Another strength is that the second part of the design is qualitative and will shed light on the implementation process of the interventions.

Firstly, we ask practices to voluntary participate in our study. This may lead to selection bias. For instance, it is likely that the most motivated practices will decide to participate. However, in daily practice forerunners will also be the first to implement patient safety improvements. By studying the effects and implementation of such interventions we hope to facilitate broader implementation. Secondly, we realise that the number of incidents as outcome is ambiguous as both increasing and decreasing numbers could indicate an improvement in patient safety culture and behaviour. However, we believe that reporting incidents is a good measurement of the change in patient safety. Especially in an organisation where patient safety initiatives are relatively new and the number of incident reports are likely to raise before they will lessen [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"><offsets xml_i="34084" xml_f="34086" txt_i="26088" txt_f="26090">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34093" xml_f="34710" txt_i="26090" txt_f="26707">]. As reporting is still very uncommon in general practice, we will consider an increase of reported incidents as an indicator of an ameliorating safety culture. Increased rates will indicate the starting of safe reporting and raised awareness. Lastly, interventions in this study are complex and may have a diffuse effect. This may be difficult to measure quantitatively. Therefore, we designed a study with mixed methods to understand the potential effect. The strength is that results will reflect daily practice and approximates the effect to be attained when this intervention would be employed on a large scale.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34717" xml_f="34966" txt_i="26708" txt_f="26957">This study will contribute to the body of knowledge concerning the effect of patient safety interventions in general practice.
