Smokers who approach publicly funded stop-smoking clinics in the UK are currently offered nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion, and group behaviour therapy, for which there is evidence of effectiveness. Acupuncture and acupressure are also used to help smokers, though a systematic review of the evidence of their effectiveness was inconclusive. The aim of this pilot project was to determine the feasibility of a study to test acupressure as an adjunct to one anti-smoking treatment currently offered, and to inform the design of the study.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="3703" xml_f="3710" txt_i="687" txt_f="694">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3721" xml_f="4439" txt_i="695" txt_f="1413">An open randomised controlled pilot study was conducted within the six week group programme offered by the Smoking Advice Service in Plymouth, UK.

Participants were taught to press the beads when they experienced cravings. Beads were worn in one ear for four weeks, being replaced as necessary.

Participants who dropped out reported significantly fewer previous quit attempts, but no other significant differences. Participants reported stimulating the beads as expected during the initial days after quitting, but most soon reduced the frequency of stimulation. The discomfort caused by the beads was minor, and there were no significant side effects. There were technical problems with adhesiveness of the dressing. Reporting of NRT consumption was poor, with much missing data, but reporting of ratings of withdrawal symptom scores was nearly complete.

Missing data for urge scores were 1%, and for bead pressure and discomfort 3%. Missing data were highest for the number of doses of NRT used per day, at 10.2%. The majority of data missing referred to the use of either a patch, which could be accurately checked by questioning at the subsequent clinic, or use of the second form of NRT which is designed to be used less frequently so missing data might result in only small errors in the analysis.

We noted wide variability in the reported consumption of NRT, particularly in group B. This was due largely to two participants in this group who did not use NRT patches: one used small numbers of microtabs, taking only 16 mg nicotine in the last week: another used large numbers of nicotine gum 4 mg, amounting to 308 mg in the last week. The alternative measure for NRT use, counting used packs, was also unsuccessful. We conclude that further investigation of the best way to measure NRT consumption is needed before this can be considered a suitable outcome for a clinical trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32961" xml_f="33161" txt_i="23442" txt_f="23642">In contrast, there were few missing data for MPSS scores.

Daily scores rose dramatically in that study to about 18 among the 43 smokers who voluntarily abstained, without nicotine replacement, for 24 hours. The lack of any such increase in our participants is presumably due to the effects of NRT and the behavioural intervention: either withdrawal symptoms do not occur, or any that do occur are not detected by the MPSS. The lack of any measurable increase in withdrawal symptoms suggests a 'floor effect', i.e. that there is no possibility of measuring an additional effect of acupressure because smoking withdrawal symptoms are already managed effectively within the limits of current measurement tools.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33861" xml_f="34253" txt_i="24297" txt_f="24689">In addition, in interacting with the participants, we detected an initial enthusiasm for trying acupressure at the time of quitting, but a marked lack of enthusiasm for the intervention at the end of the study.

High levels of expectation could in themselves increase the effectiveness of acupressure, and may improve compliance with instructions to stimulate the bead. Open studies should be conducted first to determine whether an effect exists, then by blinded studies using a placebo intervention, to test the causal relationship. We have not been able to design a convincing placebo for acupressure beads. Placebo-controlled studies of acupressure in smoking cessation require careful consideration of the ethical aspects: in view of the proven benefits of certain interventions, and the life-threatening consequences of failure, smokers should not be offered only a control intervention which the researcher expects to be ineffective. This is why we initially sought a dose-related effect in our design, and why we offered acupressure as an adjunct to known effective treatment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="35191" xml_f="35201" txt_i="25568" txt_f="25578">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="35212" xml_f="35551" txt_i="25579" txt_f="25918">This pilot study suggests that any effects of acupressure on NRT consumption or nicotine withdrawal symptoms in smoking cessation, as an adjunct to the use of NRT and behavioural intervention, are unlikely to be detectable by the methods used in this study, and further preliminary studies are required before the hypothesis can be tested.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="35573" xml_f="35592" txt_i="25920" txt_f="25939">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="35603" xml_f="35707" txt_i="25940" txt_f="26044">AW receives an income from the British Medical Acupuncture Society as editor in chief of their journal, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="35715" xml_f="35738" txt_i="26044" txt_f="26067">Acupuncture in Medicine</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="35747" xml_f="35902" txt_i="26067" txt_f="26222">.
