As a major form of upper abdominal surgery, hepatectomy is always accompanied by significant pain, and patients with severe pain are less likely to cough or move after surgery, which interferes with the return of gastrointestinal and respiratory functions. The most often used analgesic methods for pain alleviation are epidural analgesia and intravenous opioid analgesics through patient-controlled delivery systems.</offsets><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6202" xml_f="6203" txt_i="2403" txt_f="2404">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6210" xml_f="6618" txt_i="2404" txt_f="2812"> Unfortunately, epidural puncture is a relatively complicated process with potential complications. Patient-controlled pain management has the risk of addiction, as large doses of opioids are used for a long period of time. Furthermore, opioids have potentially serious side effects such as nausea, excessive sedation, respiratory depression, slowing down of bowel function, and impairment of liver function.</offsets><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6649" xml_f="6650" txt_i="2812" txt_f="2813">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6657" xml_f="6757" txt_i="2813" txt_f="2913"> Thus, to avoid these potentially serious adverse effects, postoperative pain is often undertreated.</offsets><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6788" xml_f="6789" txt_i="2913" txt_f="2914">3</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="6803" xml_f="6886" txt_i="2915" txt_f="2998">Although wound infiltration for abdominal analgesia had been used as early as 1986,</offsets><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6917" xml_f="6918" txt_i="2998" txt_f="2999">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6925" xml_f="7359" txt_i="2999" txt_f="3433"> lack of knowledge on the part of the surgeon and material limitation for localized persistent infiltration deterred it from being used to its full potential until the early 1990s.

After hepatectomy, patients are most likely to develop primary liver cancer or hepatolith, accompanied by liver dysfunction, and the procedure itself may worsen liver dysfunction and even lead to acute liver failure. Ropivacaine, as a widely used amide-type local anesthetic, has comparable efficacy to bupivacaine but lower systemic toxicity and shorter half-life to reduce the risk of plasma accumulation. Therefore, we speculate that wound instillation with 0.3% ropivacaine is an effective and well-tolerated method for postoperative analgesia after hepatectomy. We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled design study to support our hypothesis.</offsets></p><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="8289" xml_f="8296" txt_i="4291" txt_f="4298">METHODS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8307" xml_f="9343" txt_i="4299" txt_f="5332">Forty patients undergoing open hepatectomy requiring a subcostal incision &gt;20 cm that was performed by the same experienced surgeon were enrolled into our study.

The traditional effective approaches are epidural analgesia, oral or injecting nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids. As epidural puncture is always associated with side effects such as neuraxial hematoma and nerve damages, patients with spinal malformations, infectious puncture site, and anticoagulant therapy are normally precluded to use epidural analgesia.

Unexpected sensitivity to systemic opioid has been observed after hepatic resection. In addition, most hepatectomy patients experience liver dysfunction preoperatively, and surgery itself would aggravate liver dysfunction or even lead to liver failure. Thus, it would be dangerous for hepatectomy patients to consume continuous doses of opioids.
