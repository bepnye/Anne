The first step in the process included a formalized method of identification of eligible patients. A standardized eligibility form was developed and a consistent individual, the MTU care coordinator, was given the responsibility of ensuring that the form was completed. The completed eligibility form was faxed to the public health office where the database was examined and the vaccination status of the patients admitted to the MTU was reported to the MTU care coordinator. Patients who were eligible to receive the pneumococcal vaccine but had not been previously vaccinated were provided with educational materials on the vaccine by the MTU care coordinator who would, in concert with the floor nurses, housestaff and the attending internist, answer any patient questions on the vaccine. The patient was then offered the vaccine and, if they agreed, it was ordered by the housestaff on the team. The MTU care coordinator oversaw this process and would ensure that the responsible housestaff ordered the vaccine. Nursing staff administered the vaccine as ordered and completed a vaccination form that was sent to the pharmacy. The pharmacy would forward these forms on to public health so that the vaccination database could be updated.

The hospital pharmacy had anticipated an increase in vaccine utilization. However, the degree of increased vaccine ordering far exceeded that which was anticipated and there was a one week time period when patients were unable to receive vaccination prior to discharge due to lack of availability. A further limitation was that occasionally patients were discharged and left hospital prior to receiving an ordered vaccination. We were unable to quantify the number of theses cases. The continuity of a nurse coordinator in the setting of a MTU where housestaff are constantly rotating was pivotal, and this approach will be most applicable on services where there is a nurse care coordinator. A strength of our study was the presence of a population-based database of vaccination. This database allowed the intervention to taget unvaccinated patients.
