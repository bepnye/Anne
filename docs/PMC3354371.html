In addition, ketamine premedication with propofol anesthesia attenuated the hemodynamic depression without causing any significant apnoea. After 10 min, it was observed that there was no significant change in hemodynamic parameters in the ketamine group. This may be due to cardiostimulant effect of ketamine that in subanesthetic doses may balance the cardiodepressant pressure effects of propofol. This was attributed to fentanyl that causes cardiovascular depression. The patients of group II in which fentanyl was administered, the mean systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse rate were reduced significantly at 1, 3, and 5 min.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15970" xml_f="16246" txt_i="10311" txt_f="10587">The pain on propofol injection was similar in both the groups and the difference was statistically insignificant between two groups. The incidence of apnoea was significantly high in patients who received fentanyl as premedicant. Our results were comparable to other studies,[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6"><offsets xml_i="16279" xml_f="16280" txt_i="10587" txt_f="10588">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16287" xml_f="16288" txt_i="10588" txt_f="10589">–</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9"><offsets xml_i="16321" xml_f="16322" txt_i="10589" txt_f="10590">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16329" xml_f="16780" txt_i="10590" txt_f="11041">] where fentanyl was used for propofol anesthesia. The awakening time, that is, the time taken when patient opened eyes on verbal commands, was longer in group I. Similarly, the recovery time, that is, when patient was able to answer simple questions such as name, age, date of birth, time, and place, was significantly higher in group I patients. In addition, there was no unpleasant emergence phenomenon reported in any of the patients of any group.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16787" xml_f="17074" txt_i="11042" txt_f="11329">To conclude, ketamine, being a cardiostimulant drug, is better premedicant than fentanyl with respect to hemodynamic stability and adverse effects. The incidence of apnoea and respiratory depression is also less with ketamine, but the recovery was faster where fentanyl was administered.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
