The PEP-3 examines the skills and behaviors of young children (aged from 6 months to 7 years) with autism and communication disabilities and charts their uneven and idiosyncratic development, emerging skills, and autistic behaviors. It has 10 subtests, which yield three composite scores in the following three aspects: language and communication, motor, and maladaptive behaviors. Our study focused on the language and communication composite, which measures a participant’s ability to speak, listen, read, and write, with a higher score indicating better language and communication skills. We reported here the language and communication developmental ages that were converted from the raw and standardized scores based on the norming references published in the PEP-3 administration manual.

The procedure was similar to those in the aforementioned gestural recognition task (the human gesture recognition task). The order of the human gesture recognition task and robot gesture recognition task was counterbalanced across participants. In the robot gesture recognition task, the participant was presented with one video clip each time, which showed the robot producing a gesture, and he or she was asked to choose one of three options that best described its meaning.

For example, one of the S1 stories was as follows: “One day, a friend visited me and she was hungry. She wanted to dine out. I asked her where we should go for lunch. She suggested eating hamburgers. I said, ‘awesome’.” Each story in S1 contained five sentences and two to three different gestures. Each gesture only appeared once across all stories. Five different stories thereby covered all 14 gestures. This set of stories, S1, was used for training and assessment in the standardized pretests and posttests. Another set of stories (S2, non-training stories) contained five stories that were different from those in S1. S2 was presented during the assessment (but not training) sessions in order to examine the generalization effects of the intervention in the novel context.</offsets></p><p id="Par44"><offsets xml_i="37548" xml_f="38631" txt_i="25597" txt_f="26680">The stories in S1 were told by a female Cantonese speaker and her narration was recorded as audio clips. To make the recordings sound like the speech produced by a robot, robotic effects were added and the speech rate was reduced using an audio editor (Audacity, v. 2.1.0, the Audacity Team, US state). A total of five audio clips were made, each containing one story, and these were imported to NAO. The mean length of each clip was 32.2 s (ranging from 25 to 42 s). NAO then played the audio clips and gestured during the narration. The gesture and its accompanying speech started at the same time. Thus, the participants with ASD in the intervention condition watched the gestures while listening to the stories. For example, in the aforementioned story, NAO said and gestured: “I asked her where (WHERE: two arms open wide with palms facing up) we should go for lunch”. In addition to the verbal narration, the background images of the stories (e.g., a living room) were visually displayed on the laptop screen, which was placed next to NAO. One picture was shown for each story.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title><offsets xml_i="38669" xml_f="38679" txt_i="26683" txt_f="26693">Procedures</offsets></title><p id="Par45"><offsets xml_i="38701" xml_f="39099" txt_i="26694" txt_f="27092">The experiment was conducted in the treatment rooms at various special care centers in Hong Kong for participants with ASD and in kindergarten classrooms for the participants with typical development.

At the beginning of the pretest, the human researcher first greeted the participant then gave instructions. The researcher then asked the participant whether he or she understood the instructions. If the participant indicated that he or she did not understand the instructions, the researcher would repeat the instructions. Otherwise, the human researcher proceeded to narrate a story, with the corresponding pictures sequentially displayed on the laptop screen. After narrating a story once, the researcher repeated the sentences (e.g., “One day, a friend visited me and she was hungry.”), one at a time. After finishing each sentence, the researcher asked the participant to demonstrate the corresponding gesture (e.g., “What are the hand movements for expressing the feeling of being hungry?”). The participant was given 10 s to respond. The researcher prompted the participant if he or she gave no response and gave the participant another 10 s to respond. Upon receiving the participant’s response, the researcher then judged the accuracy of the gesture produced (based on the four parameters which were further elaborated in the session below) and provided feedback (correct or incorrect). The researcher then proceeded to the next sentence. After the completion of one story, the researcher moved on to the next story. The two pretests were completed after the participant had been asked to demonstrate the individual gestures in the stories in S1 and S2. Each pretest lasted for approximately 30 min.

accurately in training stories than those who did not receive training. Similar patterns were found in non-training stories, suggesting that the acquired gestural production skills could be generalized to novel stories. Additionally, the positive learning outcomes were maintained for 2 weeks when no training was provided. Even more promising, the level of gestural production accuracy in participants with ASD in the delayed posttest of non-training stories was comparable to that in participants with typical development, suggesting that participants with ASD could catch up to the level of gestural production found in participants with typical development. This finding was consistent when we also considered appropriateness of gestures. Additionally, these participants with ASD were more likely to imitate the verbal markers paired with the taught intransitive gestures in the delayed posttests of both stories than in the pretests. Gestural recognition skills were found to significantly predict the learning of gestural production in the participants with ASD, with this relation being partially mediated by spontaneous imitation.</offsets></p><p id="Par68"><offsets xml_i="67928" xml_f="68048" txt_i="50806" txt_f="50926">Previous findings have shown that robot-based gestural training is effective in teaching school-aged children with ASD [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70"><offsets xml_i="68081" xml_f="68083" txt_i="50926" txt_f="50928">70</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="68090" xml_f="68092" txt_i="50928" txt_f="50930">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72"><offsets xml_i="68125" xml_f="68127" txt_i="50930" txt_f="50932">72</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="68134" xml_f="68659" txt_i="50932" txt_f="51457">]. The present study represents significant steps forward in the development and therapeutic use of robot-based intervention. First, our results document that this intervention protocol works in preschool children, thus providing an effective early intervention for nonverbal communication skills. Additionally, the findings show that robot-based intervention may reduce the delay in gestural production in participants with ASD. Previous intervention studies have not included age-matched children with typical development [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70"><offsets xml_i="68692" xml_f="68694" txt_i="51457" txt_f="51459">70</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="68701" xml_f="68703" txt_i="51459" txt_f="51461">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72"><offsets xml_i="68736" xml_f="68738" txt_i="51461" txt_f="51463">72</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="68745" xml_f="69641" txt_i="51463" txt_f="52359">], thereby leaving open the question of whether or not participants with ASD who receive robot-based gestural training could catch up to the level of gestural production found in their age-matched participants with typical development peers. We found that the participants with ASD in the intervention condition had comparable performances to the participants with typical development in the immediate as well as in the delayed posttests in regard to non-training stories. This finding is intriguing given that, in comparison to their age-matched participants with typical development, participants with ASD have poorer language and communication abilities and fine motor proficiencies, which might influence gestural learning (see our discussion below). It also suggests that the delay in gestural production found in early childhood can be prevented by 2 weeks of robot-based gestural training.</offsets></p><p id="Par69"><offsets xml_i="69659" xml_f="70370" txt_i="52360" txt_f="53071">It is interesting to observe that the participants with ASD in the intervention condition significantly outperformed the participants with typical development in the immediate posttest of the training stories. Specifically, their proportion of trials with accurate gestures increased from .15 in the pretest to .70 in the immediate posttest (while that of the participants with typical development remained at approximately .25 in both pre- and posttests). This result may be explained by the fact that the target intransitive gestures were visually presented to the participants with ASD in the intervention condition and individuals with ASD in general process information using a visually oriented approach [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39"><offsets xml_i="70403" xml_f="70405" txt_i="53071" txt_f="53073">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="70412" xml_f="70525" txt_i="53073" txt_f="53186">]. Previous research has also shown that individuals with ASD may have superior short-term visual memory (e.g., [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34"><offsets xml_i="70558" xml_f="70560" txt_i="53186" txt_f="53188">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="70567" xml_f="70569" txt_i="53188" txt_f="53190">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56"><offsets xml_i="70602" xml_f="70604" txt_i="53190" txt_f="53192">56</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="70611" xml_f="71743" txt_i="53192" txt_f="54324">]). As a result of this, participants with ASD might benefit from the visual presentation of gestures and efficiently learn and memorize the gestures. Yet, their level of accuracy of gestural production declined in the delayed posttest of the same stories (.41), although it was still significantly higher than that of the participants with typical development. We did not observe superiority in the gestural production in the immediate and delayed posttests in non-training stories in the participants with ASD in the intervention condition, in comparison to the participants with typical development. This further strengthens our argument that short-term visual memory plays a significant role in learning and memorizing gestures incorporated in training stories. Despite this, the participants with ASD in the intervention condition could still generalize the acquired gestural production skills to the non-training stories, such that their accuracy of gestural production was greater than that of the participants with ASD in the wait-list control condition and was on par with that of the participants with typical development.</offsets></p><p id="Par70"><offsets xml_i="71761" xml_f="72129" txt_i="54325" txt_f="54693">We also observed that the proportions of gestures accurately produced in the participants with typical development were below 30% for most of the assessments across all time points. It might be attributed to the fact that we coded the gestural production accuracy according to the four parameters (use of hands, hand shape, directionality of movement, and placement; [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74"><offsets xml_i="72162" xml_f="72164" txt_i="54693" txt_f="54695">74</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="72171" xml_f="72219" txt_i="54695" txt_f="54743">]).

Thus, the gestures produced by the participants should still be considered appropriate if they could convey the target meanings. After taking appropriateness of gestures into account, the proportions of accurate or appropriate gestures reached 70% or above in the participants with typical development across all time points. On the other hand, these proportions were comparable to those of children with ASD in the intervention condition. Taken together, the participants with ASD in the intervention condition were as capable as the participants with typical development in producing accurate gestures (i.e., those demonstrated by the robot) and appropriate gestures (i.e., those not demonstrated by the robot but were appropriate in conveying the intended meanings). In future studies, we should code the gestures in terms of their accuracy based on the four parameters as well as their appropriateness.</offsets></p><p id="Par71"><offsets xml_i="73366" xml_f="73453" txt_i="55833" txt_f="55920">Previous research has shown that gestural imitation training can enhance language use [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32"><offsets xml_i="73486" xml_f="73488" txt_i="55920" txt_f="55922">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="73495" xml_f="74096" txt_i="55922" txt_f="56523">]. In line with these findings, our study reported that participants with ASD in the intervention condition were more likely to produce the verbal markers that were co-occurring with the taught gestures in the delayed posttests than in the pretests. Such result was not found in the participants in the wait-list control condition. This was possibly because the demonstration of intransitive gestures by the robot drew the attention of the participants with ASD in the intervention condition to the verbal markers. Therefore, they noticed the gestures and verbal markers as a joint communicative art [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48"><offsets xml_i="74129" xml_f="74131" txt_i="56523" txt_f="56525">48</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="74138" xml_f="74140" txt_i="56525" txt_f="56527">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49"><offsets xml_i="74173" xml_f="74175" txt_i="56527" txt_f="56529">49</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="74182" xml_f="74644" txt_i="56529" txt_f="56991">] and produced the verbal markers while gesturing in the assessment. In this sense, gestural imitation would trigger verbal imitative behaviors. Teaching children with ASD who are non-verbal or having relatively low verbal abilities gesture would facilitate their speech production. Future studies on gestural training in children with ASD should evaluate the learning outcomes on gestural production as well as the development of speech and gesture integration.</offsets></p><p id="Par72"><offsets xml_i="74662" xml_f="75852" txt_i="56992" txt_f="58182">The other major finding in the present study was that the learning of gestural production is influenced by gestural recognition skills. After controlling for the gestural production performance in the pretests of both training and non-training stories, the proportion of trials in which the participants with ASD recognized gestures significantly predicted the proportion of trials in which they produced gestures accurately in the delayed posttests. Language and communication abilities, fine motor proficiencies, and attention skills were found to be non-significant. We further established that gestural recognition would influence participants’ ability to produce gestures accurately, with this relation being partially mediated by the spontaneous imitation that occurred during training. These findings suggest that participants with ASD who better understand the meanings of gestures are more likely to spontaneously imitate the gestures demonstrated by the robot, which results in an enhancement in gestural production skills. These results are in line with previous research, which has shown that children with ASD have stronger motivations to imitate the gestures they understand [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31"><offsets xml_i="75885" xml_f="75887" txt_i="58182" txt_f="58184">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="75894" xml_f="76152" txt_i="58184" txt_f="58442">].

Theoretically, our findings have extended the previous research, which has posited that robot-based gestural training can be considered as an effective early intervention for gestural communication. It also has strong implications for the direction in which technology-based interventions for preschoolers with ASD should proceed. Practically, our research could promote the implementation of robot-based interventions in preschool education, even for children whose language and motor skills are delayed. Note that the language and communication ages of the participants with ASD participating in this study fell behind their chronological ages, suggesting that they might have language delay. Their fine motor proficiencies were poorer than those of the age-matched participants with typical development too. However, after four robot-based gestural training sessions, they could still produce gestures as accurately as the participants with typical development. Our protocol may also be useful in promoting general social competence, such as joint attention, perspective taking, and understanding others’ intentions.</offsets></p><p id="Par74"><offsets xml_i="77606" xml_f="78276" txt_i="59747" txt_f="60417">That said, this study has a few limitations. First, there is no evidence showing that participants with ASD who received training actually applied the acquired gestural production skills when interacting with others in their daily lives. Hence, we cannot comment on the social utility of our intervention program. In future studies, we will observe the gestural communication of the participants in schools and at home for a longer period of time. Measuring generalization and long-term maintenance effects is always challenging, because it is difficult to maintain follow-up and control confounding variables. Therefore, there are very few long-term follow-up studies [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46"><offsets xml_i="78309" xml_f="78311" txt_i="60417" txt_f="60419">46</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="78318" xml_f="79186" txt_i="60419" txt_f="61287">]. Besides, one may question whether or not the robot is better than humans at being a teacher for children with ASD, which was not addressed in the present study. We are currently conducting a new study, which compares the effectiveness of robot-based intervention to that of human-based intervention on conversation skills in children with ASD. We are not proposing that either humans or robots should be the teaching agent. Rather, we propose that robots can serve as an effective agent in teaching children with ASD social and communication skills. Related to the aforementioned limitation, the present study deployed NAO, a humanoid robot, as a teacher to train children with ASD gestural communication skills.
