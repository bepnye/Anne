A longer application time of tetracaine should be considered in future trials. Future trials should also consider including sucrose into their intervention to decrease pain associated with insertion of a PICC, even in very immature infants who are not feeding.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34998" xml_f="35017" txt_i="28067" txt_f="28086">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="35028" xml_f="35088" txt_i="28087" txt_f="28147">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="35110" xml_f="35132" txt_i="28149" txt_f="28171">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="35143" xml_f="35773" txt_i="28172" txt_f="28802">BL designed the study, received peer reviewed funding to conduct the trial and drafted the manuscript.
