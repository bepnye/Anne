Episodes of early suckling were noted. Number of breastfeeds, amount of milk ingested (recorded on day 4 postpartum) and duration of "nearly exclusive" breastfeeding were recorded.

In contrast, there was no difference in milk production between multi- and primiparous mothers in the groups rooming-in and feeding on demand (Groups I, II and IV), although multiparas had higher numbers of feedings than primiparas. In addition during the first three days postpartum, multiparous mothers had higher perception of physiological breast engorgement and lower intensity of feeling "low/blue" than primiparous mothers. Early suckling was shown to positively affect milk production irrespective of parity. Thus Group I and II infants who suckled within the first two hours after birth ingested significantly more milk on day 4 than those who had not (284 and 184 ml respectively, SE = 14 and 27 ml, p = 0.0006).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6840" xml_f="7515" txt_i="2564" txt_f="3236">Regression analyses evaluated factors most important for milk production and found in Groups I and II for primiparous women that early suckling, intensity of breast engorgement and number of breastfeeds on day 3 were most important. Intensity of feeling "low/blue" was negatively related to amount of milk ingested. The significant factor for multiparous women was early suckling. Similar results were obtained in Groups III and IV; however, in primiparous mothers, engorgement was the most important factor and in multiparous women it was rooming-in. Amount of milk produced on day 4 was strongly correlated to a duration of "nearly exclusive" breastfeeding (p &lt; 0.0001).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7537" xml_f="7547" txt_i="3238" txt_f="3248">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7558" xml_f="7789" txt_i="3249" txt_f="3480">The present data show that ward routines influence milk production.

One such example of this change is the practice of putting the newborn baby directly in skin-to-skin contact with the mother immediately after birth. The reasons for skin-to-skin contact are many: it may enhance early breastfeeding, as the baby has been shown to have an inborn pre-feeding behavioural instinct and starts suckling the breast by him/herself [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="8440" xml_f="8441" txt_i="4037" txt_f="4038">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8448" xml_f="8483" txt_i="4038" txt_f="4073">]; the mother keeps the baby warm [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="8514" xml_f="8515" txt_i="4073" txt_f="4074">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8522" xml_f="8554" txt_i="4074" txt_f="4106">] and the baby will be relaxed [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="8585" xml_f="8586" txt_i="4106" txt_f="4107">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8593" xml_f="8622" txt_i="4107" txt_f="4136">] and in a non-crying state [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="8653" xml_f="8654" txt_i="4136" txt_f="4137">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8661" xml_f="8705" txt_i="4137" txt_f="4181">].

day 3" and "number of breastfeeds on day 3" were used in the regression analyses. The regression analysis performed in primiparas showed that the most important variable for milk volume on day 4 was "early suckling". According to the b-coefficient, successful early suckling was associated with a mean increase of 98 ml of milk (keeping other variables constant). In addition, marked breast engorgement on day 3 was associated, on average, with 71 ml more milk and each extra breastfeed on day 3 resulted in a mean increase in milk amount of 21 ml.

For these two groups, the explanatory variables "rooming-in", "swaddling", "marked engorgement on day 3" and "feeling 'low/blue' on day 3" were used in the regression analyses, performed in primi- and multiparous women, respectively. Again different results were obtained in primi- and multiparous mothers. The variable "marked engorgement" was associated with a significant mean increase of 157 ml of milk on day 4 while "feeling low/blue" gave a significant mean decrease of 159 ml in the primiparous mothers. In the multiparous mothers, however, the only significant explanatory variable was "rooming-in" which was associated with a mean increase of 149 ml milk.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="50005" xml_f="50098" txt_i="35082" txt_f="35175">Long-term effects of parity and ward routines on duration of "nearly exclusive" breastfeeding</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="50109" xml_f="50415" txt_i="35176" txt_f="35482">The only variable found to predict the duration of "nearly exclusive" breastfeeding was "amount of milk ingested on day 4".
