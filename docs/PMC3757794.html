The difficulty of intubation was assessed with the IDS score. The IDS score was low and comparable between the two groups; hence, the intubation was easy with both the laryngoscopes. No manoeuvres were required to improve the success of intubation in either of the groups. In our study, first attempt intubation success was 100% with both the laryngoscopes; this may be because we did not include patients with anticipated difficult airway, used a stylet in both the groups, and an experienced anesthetist performed the laryngoscopy.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18351" xml_f="18730" txt_i="13127" txt_f="13506">The parameters used to assess the laryngoscopic view were MCL grading and POGO score.

It is difficult to direct the tracheal tube through the vocal cords whilst viewing the image through the view tube. The field of vision is narrower and smaller, requiring more time to identify the pharyngeal and laryngeal structures. There is also an angulated view of the larynx, which necessitates the use of stylet to direct the tracheal tube to the glottic opening. Moreover, the experience of the anesthetist with the Truview blade is comparatively less compared to that with the Macintosh blade. The ease of use of laryngoscopes showed that both the blades were easy to use. There was no incidence of any dental or other trauma in either group.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21536" xml_f="22150" txt_i="15795" txt_f="16409">The main limitation of our study was that, firstly, the anesthetist performing the intubation was not blinded to the study group due to the unfeasibility of blinding and the possibility of bias existed. Secondly, the experience of the anesthetist with the Macintosh laryngoscope was far more and better than that with the Truview laryngoscope. Thirdly, there were a few differences between the two groups with regard to the preoperative demographic data (BMI was significantly higher in the Truview group) and the airway assessment parameters (mento thyroid distance was significantly less with the Truview group).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22157" xml_f="22604" txt_i="16410" txt_f="16857">In conclusion, the Truview EVO2 laryngoscope performed comparably to the Macintosh laryngoscope in the normal adult airway; however, the Truview laryngoscope may be a better option in difficult airway situations when the Macintosh blade fails to show the glottic opening. Additional studies are necessitated to prove the usefulness of Truview EVO2 in difficult airway situations, as this is the cheapest available video laryngoscope in the market.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
