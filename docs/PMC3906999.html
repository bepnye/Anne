The training will be based on a complete training guide and material provided by the WHO, which contains the necessary course material for trainees and preparatory and guidance materials for trainers. It will be conducted by the PI (who has been trained by the Royal College of Psychiatrists affiliated mhGAP training programme, UK), mhGAP IG experts, and another clinically experienced psychiatrist. Training programs will be conducted as a full-day course for five consecutive days, as originally designed by the WHO. The training intervention will be given to 43 (approximately half) of the recruited PCP in the intervention arm, randomized by appropriate techniques.

The coordinator will provide an information leaflet and obtain secondary written consent from each patient. Consenting patients will then be directed to the study psychiatrist, who will reassess them according to mhGAP-based criteria for concurrence with the initial PCP diagnosis. Unless absolutely necessary, the psychiatrist will not modify or change the treatment or management outlined by the PCP. For those patients categorized as referrals to specialist care, their treatment and management will be provided by the study psychiatrist. However, referral patients will be completely free to decide if they want to be treated by the study psychiatrist or to seek care from other government or private specialist psychiatrists.

Additionally, there is a possibility of PCP in different study groups exchanging information received in the training. While we acknowledge that such interaction may potentially lead to contamination, it should be noted that this will be extremely difficult to prevent, and is not likely have a significant influence on the outcome. Because the training provided during the study is very thorough, and the study group participants are required to carry out intensive tasks, contamination through exchanges of information in informal discussions is not anticipated. However, as a preventive action, both the study and control group PCPs will be requested to refrain from seeking study-related information from each other for the duration of the intervention. At all possible times during recruitment, training, and monitoring, steps will be taken to observe potential contamination. At the end of the study, information will be gathered separately from both groups in order to gain an insight into potential contamination. However, it must be mentioned that, as this is a feasibility pilot study, minor contamination may not affect the outcomes to a large degree.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23571" xml_f="23583" txt_i="17806" txt_f="17818">Measurements</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23594" xml_f="24527" txt_i="17819" txt_f="18752">A sociodemographic questionnaire will be administered to all PCP, and this will include a section on medical education and experience at the point of recruitment.

In post-conflict Sri Lanka, an important need exists to provide adequate mental health care to conflict-affected IDP returning to their area of origin after prolonged displacement. The proposed study will act as a local demonstration project exploring the feasibility of formulating a larger-scale intervention study in the future, and is envisaged to provide information on PCP engagement, training and evaluation, and rates of patient recruitment, acceptance, and follow-up. It is also planned to measure the views, attitudes, and perceptions of PCP on integrating mental health in to primary care. The economic evaluation is aimed at collating information about the costs involved in obtaining and providing mental health care in resource-poor primary care settings, which will aid policy decisions on management of IDP and other vulnerable populations. The study stands to provide important information on the WHO mhGAP intervention guide to add to the growing evidence base of its implementation, which will be helpful to tailor it to training primary care workers in other global conflict-affected populations and humanitarian contexts.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34124" xml_f="34136" txt_i="27807" txt_f="27819">Trial status</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34147" xml_f="34157" txt_i="27820" txt_f="27830">Commenced.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34179" xml_f="34192" txt_i="27832" txt_f="27845">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34203" xml_f="34765" txt_i="27846" txt_f="28408">An intervention to improve mental health care for conflict-affected forced migrants in low-resource primary care settings: A WHO MhGAP-based pilot study in Sri Lanka (COM-GAP); ANOVA: Analysis of variance; CONSORT: Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; CSRI: Client service receipt inventory; DALY: Disability adjusted life year; GCP: Good clinical practice; IDP: Internally displaced people; PCP: Primary care practitioner; PHQ: Patient health questionnaire; mhGAP IG: Mental health gap action programme intervention guide; WHO: World Health Organization.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34787" xml_f="34806" txt_i="28410" txt_f="28429">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34817" xml_f="34860" txt_i="28430" txt_f="28473">The authors declare no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34882" xml_f="34904" txt_i="28475" txt_f="28497">Authors’ contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34915" xml_f="35171" txt_i="28498" txt_f="28754">CS conceived the study, and wrote the study protocol and manuscript.
