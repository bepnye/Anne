This was achieved through a variety of different methods. We targeted women who called the Motherisk program. The Motherisk program is a telephone counselling program that provides evidence-based information to healthcare professionals and women about the safety and teratogenic risks associated with drugs, chemicals, radiation, infections and other exposures in the periconceptional period. Due to the large volume of callers every day, study details were presented to women who fit the inclusion criteria by Motherisk counsellors and they were asked for telephone consent and follow-up by the study coordinator if they expressed interest in participating. Motherisk counsellors were trained to briefly explain the main objective, intervention, time course and target population of the clinical trial to callers who expressed interest. Interested callers were then followed up by the study coordinator. Voicemails were left after initial consent if interested callers could not be reached, and were called back up to a maximum of three times. Concurrently, we used notice board postings at Sick Kids and Women’s College hospitals in areas where a general high traffic of families was expected. The notice board postings at both these hospitals were re-posted monthly or as needed after approval from Public Relations department. Furthermore, study materials were presented in the form of brochures and postings before and after clinic appointments, to eligible women at the above hospitals as well as fertility clinics associated with the study. This was achieved through multiple ways. Study brochures were available within waiting rooms and study postings were also posted on bulletin boards within the clinics. Secondary staff, who usually included research coordinators at other clinics or hospitals, closely communicated with the folic acid study coordinator to identify eligible patients arriving at the clinic for the upcoming week. Patients were screened on the basis of the inclusion criteria, with the major determiners being women who were “early in pregnancy” or “trying to conceive within 3 months” and “were not currently on folate-containing multivitamins”. Eligible patients were flagged based on the review of patient charts each week and upon their clinic visit, study details were presented to them through two possible ways: either through physicians at the clinic during their consultation, or, if this was not possible due to time-constraints or other commitments of an appointment, physicians often directed flagged patients to secondary staff at each clinic, who were trained to briefly outline study information and were able to spend more time with each patient reviewing the objective and demands of the study. In both these cases, upon interest, a women was handed a study brochure outlining study information and the contact information of the study coordinator. Interested women were asked to contact the study coordinator directly via telephone or email, as listed on the brochure. Monthly meetings were held at all clinics between the study coordinator and the secondary study staff to go over recruitment progress and replenish advertisement supplies. All study postings were also revisited monthly or as needed for renewal.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19176" xml_f="19805" txt_i="10446" txt_f="11075">After the study had been going on for 4 years, recruitment strategies were re-evaluated in the second phase of the study (December 2011–May 2012). We continued to actively engage in recruitment approaches based amongst healthcare establishments. These included pregnancy and prenatal community programs and health centers, family doctor’s offices, new immigrants and women’s centers, university health clinics, and midwifery clinics, as well as all of the previously used recruitment sources.

As monetary incentive was advertised within the posting, there may be concerns that the population recruited may be more interested in money-making endeavours and may not be fully committed to the study, since platforms such as Kijiji and Craigslist (which contributed about 58% of recruits in Phase 2) are often used to find economical deals. However, comparisons of socio-demographic characteristics as well as a previous history of medical conditions and fertility issues between recruits from traditional healthcare-based vs. social media-based sources revealed no differences in our study. Due to our limitations of a small sample size, further research is necessary to investigate potential bias in the population recruited from social media-based platforms. Nonetheless, our results suggested that even though compensation may act as an initial attractor to invoke interest in pursuing a study, since participants were only given compensation upon completing the study, their continued participation indicated commitment to research for benefits beyond short-term monetary gain.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="55256" xml_f="55454" txt_i="30351" txt_f="30549">While privacy issues and legal concerns were not a challenge that we personally faced, they pose a great obstacle preventing most researchers from adopting social media-based recruitment approaches </offsets><xref rid="pone.0092744-Omurtag1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="55504" xml_f="55507" txt_i="30549" txt_f="30552">[6]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="55514" xml_f="55516" txt_i="30552" txt_f="30554">, </offsets><xref rid="pone.0092744-Pyper1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="55564" xml_f="55567" txt_i="30554" txt_f="30557">[9]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="55574" xml_f="56114" txt_i="30557" txt_f="31097">.

These were limited within our study because of the small sample size requirements of the clinic trial this is associated with. Yet this sample size was sufficient to demonstrate significant changes due to a large effect size. Further larger-scale research is warranted to explore the applied use of social media as part of larger clinical trials.

Participants should not be treated merely as ‘the general population’. It is crucial to identify the defining characteristics and social networks of the population being targeted if it represents a special population (i.e. pregnant women vs. women battling cancer vs. elderly). This will not only help in creating population-specific platforms and goals, but also present early insight into the potential efficacy of recruitment through social media as an approach based on the internet use and medical-information-intensive use of a particular demographic. Even if the study merely aims to recruit “healthy volunteers” from the “general population”, the overall population should be segmented to different demographics, and each should be targeted individually for optimal results. In the age of internet access and the reliance of the population on the internet for medical information, it is crucial that we use online tools of social media to personally target and empower the participant, and move away from mere business and marketing approaches to recruitment where ads are created as ‘one-size-fits-all’ aimed to capture a random portion of the ‘general population’.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="58756" xml_f="59109" txt_i="33631" txt_f="33984">To truly recruit individuals who are interested in research for its own sake and the potential benefits it represents to them as well as the society at large, it is critical to approach participants with intentions of honest medical dialogue, equipped to address more complex questions given the plethora of information they are exposed to the internet.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="59116" xml_f="59388" txt_i="33985" txt_f="34257">Online social media, if used correctly, epitomizes community and conversation, and is a definite movement away from fears of coercion that may arise with the use of high incentives, direct interaction with the primary caregiver, as well as some other means of recruitment.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title><offsets xml_i="59419" xml_f="59519" txt_i="34259" txt_f="34359">2) Using a Combination of Passive, Broad-spectrum, as Well as Targeted Active Recruitment Techniques</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="59530" xml_f="59807" txt_i="34360" txt_f="34637">Any holistic recruitment strategy should incorporate a combination of active and passive recruitment techniques to maximize chances of success.

Despite potential apprehensions, social media holds great promise as a recruitment tool if applied in a targeted and regulated fashion. Though the magnitude of its impact on recruitment may vary based on the sample size required, the study design, and the nature of its intervention, social media can be effectively incorporated in the recruitment efforts of any study to enhance current recruitment methods.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0092744-Watson1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
