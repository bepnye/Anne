Question on whether the findings of this study will be observed if the outcome measurement was done after a longer period is to be considered; however, in the context of the study area, where the malaria transmission is highly seasonal, the HMM strategy will be implemented within the same timeframes used in this study to avoid wastage of resources and minimize the over-treatment of malaria during the low transmission season, when prevalence of the disease is very low. Therefore, the findings of this study could be considered as valid for areas with the same transmission pattern; different assessment timeframe need to be implemented in areas with a longer transmission period, to account for the necessity to sustain the HMM strategy in order to induce an optimum impact on the outcome measured in this study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29985" xml_f="30760" txt_i="21017" txt_f="21792">The number of malaria episodes treated in the intervention arm was more than double the number of cases treated in the control arm (+156%). This shows that once the option of treating malaria close to home is made available, caregivers make use of it and the number of malaria episodes treated increases. No other reason can explain this finding, as both areas have a similar epidemiological profile and malaria transmission pattern, with comparable health care-seeking behaviour, as shown in the baseline data. The most plausible explanation is thus that the presence of CHWs/KOLs, by increasing the access to an effective treatment in the intervention arm, has boosted the caregiver's willingness to use this new possibility, reducing the use of other sources of treatment.</offsets></p><p></p><p><offsets xml_i="30774" xml_f="31631" txt_i="21794" txt_f="22651">It is possible that, at the community level, the CHWs/KOLs have played the role of "triage staff" for the health facilities, by treating the malaria cases and referring those cases not considered as caused by malaria to the health facility level. This was possible since the training module of the CHWs/KOLs included recognition of the most prevalent non-malaria illnesses in the area (mainly cough with fast breathing proxy for pneumonia, diarrhoeal diseases) and the recommendation of immediate referral to the health system to avoid unnecessary delay in the management of those cases. Also, after two days of home treatment, persistence of the fever warrants a visit to the health facility, since this is more likely to be attributable to other causes than malaria. Unfortunately, no data were collected to document the possible indications for referral.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="31638" xml_f="31748" txt_i="22652" txt_f="22762">The feasibility and acceptability of the use of ACTs within the context of HMM has been demonstrated by Ajayi </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="31756" xml_f="31762" txt_i="22762" txt_f="22768">et al </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="31771" xml_f="31772" txt_i="22768" txt_f="22769">[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><offsets xml_i="31804" xml_f="31806" txt_i="22769" txt_f="22771">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31813" xml_f="32328" txt_i="22771" txt_f="23286">], in a multi-centre study involving four African sites.
