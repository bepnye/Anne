Hence, the present study was undertaken with the objectives to evaluate fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth which are obturated with Gutta-percha-AH-plus and Resilon/Epiphany obturating system. Gutta-percha is the most commonly used root canal-filling material in contemporary endodontics. It has been considered to be gold standard for over 100 years, and no suitable substitute has yet emerged. Gutta-percha is highly biocompatible material and is of low cytotoxicity the sealants that are used determine the tissue response. Despite apparently satisfactory performance over many decades, Gutta-percha and sealers-filling techniques do not represent the universal ideals. The drawback with Gutta-percha is that it does not reinforce the roots, on the contrary it has been shown to weaken the roots after obturation.
