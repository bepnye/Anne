Here, we report results from a replication of the experiment conducted during the U.S. Presidential Election in 2012. In spite of the fact that get-out-the-vote messages typically yield smaller effects during high-stakes elections due to saturation of mobilization efforts from many sources, a significant increase in voting was again observed. Voting also increased significantly among the close friends of those who received the message to go to the polls, and the total effect on the friends was likely larger than the direct effect, suggesting that understanding social influence effects is potentially even more important than understanding the direct effects of messaging. These results replicate earlier work and they add to growing evidence that online social networks can be instrumental for spreading offline behaviors.</offsets></p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.

These 13 states are those that make publicly available voting records that include the variables necessary to match subject records. Specifically, the necessary variables were first name, last name, state of residence and full birthdate. The list of states is the same as was used in the 2010 experiment, and in total these states account for about 40% of all registered voters in the U.S. After we removed duplicates in both the Facebook data and the public voter data (accounting for &lt;0.3% of each sample), 15,060,897 records matched exactly in their first name, last name, state of residence, and full birthdate. Of these, 10,155,987 records indicated the user had logged in on Election Day. Additional users with the Facebook mobile app were eligible to receive a push notification about Election Day, which they were assigned to receive if they were randomly assigned to the banner treatment. Due to technical limitations, we did not observe the eligibility to receive this push notification, and so the randomization to the banner treatment is not valid once conditioning on logging in on Election Day; this is because receiving the notification caused some users to log into Facebook who would not otherwise have done so. This is manifest in a statistically significant difference, among users who logged in, in age between those in the Banner condition and those not. Thus, we focus on the intent-to-treat (ITT) effect on the larger population of all individuals who matched with the public voter data (15,060,897). Compared with the analysis of the 2010 Election, which estimates the effect on only those who log in, our estimates are expected to be smaller and more noisy (because we consider the effect on those who may have never logged on to Facebook or have seen a push notification on election day). However, due to the risk of confounding, we believe it is appropriate to consider this broader population and provide a conservative estimate of the effects on a population for whom we are confident that randomization was achieved. We also consider rescalings of these estimates below to make them more comparable with 2010.</offsets></p><table-wrap id="pone.0173851.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi"><offsets xml_i="23418" xml_f="23451" txt_i="10498" txt_f="10531">10.1371/journal.pone.0173851.t001</offsets></object-id><label><offsets xml_i="23470" xml_f="23477" txt_i="10531" txt_f="10538">Table 1</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="23501" xml_f="23575" txt_i="10538" txt_f="10612">Percentage of participants assigned to each condition in the 2 x 2 design.</offsets></title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0173851.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0173851.t001"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"></col><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"></col><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic><offsets xml_i="24001" xml_f="24017" txt_i="10613" txt_f="10629">Banner Condition</offsets></italic></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic><offsets xml_i="24080" xml_f="24087" txt_i="10629" txt_f="10636">Control</offsets></italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic><offsets xml_i="24174" xml_f="24188" txt_i="10636" txt_f="10650">Feed Condition</offsets></italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="24243" xml_f="24246" txt_i="10651" txt_f="10654">96%</offsets></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="24292" xml_f="24294" txt_i="10655" txt_f="10657">1%</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic><offsets xml_i="24357" xml_f="24364" txt_i="10658" txt_f="10665">Control</offsets></italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="24419" xml_f="24421" txt_i="10666" txt_f="10668">2%</offsets></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="24467" xml_f="24469" txt_i="10669" txt_f="10671">1%</offsets></td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec003"><title><offsets xml_i="24572" xml_f="24579" txt_i="10673" txt_f="10680">Results</offsets></title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173851.g002"><offsets xml_i="24635" xml_f="24640" txt_i="10681" txt_f="10686">Fig 2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24647" xml_f="25625" txt_i="10686" txt_f="11664"> summarizes the main results. The 2010 experiment did not have separate treatments for banner and feed, so for the 2012 experiment we first measure the direct effect of being in both banner and feed treatments (N = 14,458,236) compared to being in neither (N = 150,139). The untreated group had a validated turnout rate of 73.91% compared to 74.08% for the treated group. A simple regression of turnout on an indicator variable for receiving both treatments increased the likelihood of voting by +0.17% (the 95% confidence interval [CI] for the coefficient in the regression is –0.05% to +0.4%) but this estimate is too noisy to yield confidence that it is different from chance. To increase precision, we include in the regression past voting behavior in 2010 (encoded as two dummy variables, voted and abstained, with unknown status as the baseline category). This yields an estimated treatment effect of +0.24% (95% CI +0.03% to +0.44%) that is unlikely to be due to chance (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="25633" xml_f="25634" txt_i="11664" txt_f="11665">p</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="25643" xml_f="26034" txt_i="11665" txt_f="12056"> = 0.0266).
