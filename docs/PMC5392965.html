It is generally a successful operation, but has well-documented risks for the patient. Thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate (ThuVARP) vaporises and resects the prostate using a surgical technique similar to TURP. The small amount of study data currently available suggests that ThuVARP may have certain advantages over TURP, including reduced blood loss and shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activities, and shorter duration of catheterisation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7342" xml_f="7348" txt_i="728" txt_f="734">Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7359" xml_f="7885" txt_i="735" txt_f="1261">A multicentre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled, parallel-group trial of ThuVARP versus standard TURP in men with BPO. Four hundred and ten men suitable for prostate surgery were randomised to receive either ThuVARP or TURP at four university teaching hospitals, and three district general hospitals.

As men get older their prostates enlarge, potentially causing BPO, which often requires surgery. Therefore, as the population ages, more prostate operations are needed to relieve obstruction. There is hence sustained interest in the condition and increasing need to find safer techniques than TURP. Various laser techniques have become available but none are widely used in the NHS because of lengthy training required for surgeons or inferior performance on clinical outcomes. Promising initial evidence from one RCT shows that ThuVARP has equivalent clinical effectiveness when compared to TURP, as well as other potential advantages. As ThuVARP uses a technique similar to that used in TURP, the learning curve is short, potentially making it also very quickly generalisable. This randomised study is designed to provide the high-quality evidence, in an NHS setting, with a range of patient-reported, clinical and cost-effectiveness outcomes, which will underpin and inform future NICE guidance.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9005" xml_f="9023" txt_i="2331" txt_f="2349">Trial registration</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9034" xml_f="9051" txt_i="2350" txt_f="2367">ISRCTN registry, </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://isrctn.com/ISRCTN00788389"><offsets xml_i="9127" xml_f="9141" txt_i="2367" txt_f="2381">ISRCTN00788389</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="9152" xml_f="9186" txt_i="2381" txt_f="2415">.

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), the gold standard operation, accounts for around 80% of these operations. TURP has been used widely for the last 40 years, and although it is generally a successful procedure, it is associated with small but significant risks. It has a 30-day mortality of 0.3%, and a range of morbidities including transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome (1%), which is due to the absorption of irrigating fluid leading to confusion and collapse; haemorrhage during the operation (transfusion rate: 5%); and subsequent urinary tract infections (up to 20%) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3"><offsets xml_i="12189" xml_f="12190" txt_i="4208" txt_f="4209">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12197" xml_f="12412" txt_i="4209" txt_f="4424">].

This is due, in part, to a long learning curve, or inferior performance regarding clinical outcomes, reducing the wider uptake. In fact, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data shows that the percentage of laser procedures has only increased in England by 2% over the past 5 years, from 2894 in 2009/10 to 2958 in 2011/12.

Furthermore, as the operation is increasingly conducted on older men (42% of the TURP operations in 2014–2015 were on patients older than 75 years), the risks of surgery associated with TURP will continue to increase. There is therefore sustained interest in the condition and increasing need to find safer techniques than TURP. The potential advantages of reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stay and earlier return to normal activities make laser vaporesection techniques attractive to both patients and health care providers. ThuVARP would allow urologists to operate on a wider range of men, including potentially those who are more frail and older, but with less risk. However, there is uncertainty about the degree of symptom improvement and improvement in quality of life in the short and longer term, which this trial addresses.

Shortened stay is increasingly important for the NHS both because of the increasing cost of inpatient beds, shortage of inpatient beds due to an ageing and increasingly co-morbid population, and the risk longer hospital stays present for such patients, for example of hospital-acquired infections.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16988" xml_f="17426" txt_i="8662" txt_f="9100">In summary, although there is little existing work on ThuVARP, promising initial evidence from one RCT suggests that ThuVARP has equivalent clinical effectiveness when compared to TURP, albeit in a single Chinese centre.
