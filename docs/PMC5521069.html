With a different needle entry point, the retroclavicular approach confers a perpendicular angle between the ultrasound and the needle, which theoretically enhances needle visualization. This trial compares these two techniques. The leading hypothesis is that the retroclavicular approach is comparable to the infraclavicular coracoid approach in general aspects, but needle visualization is better with this novel approach.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5581" xml_f="5588" txt_i="595" txt_f="602">Methods</offsets></title><p id="Par2"><offsets xml_i="5609" xml_f="6722" txt_i="603" txt_f="1716">We designed a multicentre, randomized, non-inferiority trial.

They will be excluded if they meet contraindicated criteria to regional anaesthesia, have affected anatomy of the clavicle or are pregnant. Randomization will be done by a computer-generated randomization schedule stratified for each site and in 1:1 ratio, and concealment will be maintained with opaque, sealed envelopes in a locked office. The primary outcome, the performance time, will be analyzed using non-inferiority analysis while secondary outcomes will be analyzed with superiority analysis. Needle visualization will be ranked on a Likert scale of 1–5 that is subjective and represents a pitfall. Two separate persons will rank needle visualization to compensate this pitfall.

Finally, we might have therapeutic personality bias as in the consent form we mention our expectation of a shorter and less painful block with the RCB approach. However, we deemed it necessary to mention those facts because they are some of the implied reasons for the implementation of this trial.</offsets></p><p id="Par77"><offsets xml_i="37048" xml_f="37837" txt_i="27433" txt_f="28222">For data analysis, we have two principal biases. First, we might have an “all is well in the literature” bias when using the Likert scale to evaluate needle visibility. This scale has been previously used in the similar studies; however, it has never been validated and results should thus be interpreted with caution. Unfortunately, no validated tools exist for this purpose. Furthermore, there might be detection bias even if the outcome assessor for the motor and sensory block is blinded to the procedure. To minimize this we will extend the chlorhexidine application to the two needle insertion points and two bandages will be applied even if no needle was inserted for one of them. However, blood leaking or soaking the bandage might inform the outcome assessor on the approach used.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title><offsets xml_i="37870" xml_f="37875" txt_i="28224" txt_f="28229">Harms</offsets></title><p id="Par78"><offsets xml_i="37897" xml_f="38588" txt_i="28230" txt_f="28921">Potential harms are mentioned to the patient as standard before any regional anaesthesia, including risk of pneumothorax, transient or permanent nerve injury, vascular puncture, infections, Horner syndrome or failed plexus block. This practice will be maintained throughout this trial. Any adverse effects or complications will be compiled in the data collection form, but we do not expect to have enough power to find any significant differences. In the feasibility study, no significant or permanent harms were inflicted on the patients with the experimental method.

The reference number is MP-31-2017-1298. This ethics committee provided provincial approval for recruitment and was thus the only committee required to recruit patients in the participating centres.</p><p id="Par87">Informed consent will be obtained for all participants in this trial. The consent will be completed the day of the procedure, as previously explained. Patient autonomy and freedom will be respected and maintained. Patients will be seen at least one hour before the scheduled surgery to allow the patient some time to think about the research project. Other options in order to meet the patients earlier were evaluated but were deemed too complex, as the OR schedule is often changed at short notice and patients are usually not available until their arrival in hospital a few hours before the surgery.</p><p id="Par88">Only the research coordinator will initially meet the patient to ensure the quality of the explanation of the study. A consent form will be given at that time, which explains in detail the objective of the project, the risks, the advantages and the time implication. Queries will be answered at this first encounter and the patient will be reminded that assent will not affect the professionalism and the quality of care that the patient will receive. The patients will also be assured that they can withdraw consent at any time without being questioned.</p><p id="Par89">When the patient is transferred to the surgical unit, the same research member or anaesthesiologist will meet the patient for the second time and answer their questions, if any. If consent is obtained, the recruiter will make sure the patient signs the consent form. Deferred consent will not be accepted because it is not an urgent situation. If consent is not obtained, the patient will be offered any other option for surgical anaesthesia, as a plexus block or as general anaesthesia. It is to be noted that the patient is seen immediately before surgery as standard to establish the anaesthesia plan. Thus, the recruitment on the day is not notably different.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par90">Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Competing
