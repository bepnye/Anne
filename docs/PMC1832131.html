Although schools are critical venues for youth tobacco control, it is unrealistic to assume that school-based interventions can serve, and be suitable for, millions of U.S. teenage smokers. Focusing only on schools limits access to intervention, particularly for high-risk teenagers who attend school infrequently, hold negative attitudes toward school, have dropped out, are detained, or attend schools with limited resources. Ideally, youths who smoke should be saturated with options for cessation in multiple settings — schools; churches; primary care settings; and other clinical settings, including hospital emergency departments (EDs).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6042" xml_f="6600" txt_i="3183" txt_f="3741">One minimally researched approach for teenage smoking is a clinic-based intervention that incorporates motivational interviewing (6). Motivational interviewing is a counseling technique used to promote behavior change that 1) can be designed in developmentally appropriate ways, 2) can be tailored to individual needs, 3) is flexible and brief, 4) can be combined with additional components (e.g., self-help materials), 5) can reinforce efforts made in schools and communities, and 6) can address individual levels of motivation and confidence for quitting (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="6631" xml_f="6632" txt_i="3741" txt_f="3742">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6639" xml_f="6879" txt_i="3742" txt_f="3982">). Based in client-centered therapy, social cognitive theory, and cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing incorporates six elements (FRAMES): feedback, responsibility, advice, menu of strategies, empathy, and self-efficacy (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="6910" xml_f="6911" txt_i="3982" txt_f="3983">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6918" xml_f="7014" txt_i="3983" txt_f="4079">). Goal setting, follow-up, and timing also are important aspects of motivational interviewing (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="7045" xml_f="7046" txt_i="4079" txt_f="4080">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7053" xml_f="7574" txt_i="4080" txt_f="4601">). This intervention technique assumes that the responsibility for change rests within the patient. Importantly, interventionists create conditions that promote motivation and confidence to change. This is achieved using five basic strategies: 1) asking open-ended questions, 2) using reflective listening, 3) developing discrepancy (i.e., helping the patient understand the differences between the present behavior and his or her values), 4) providing personalized feedback, and 5) eliciting self-motivating statements (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="7605" xml_f="7606" txt_i="4601" txt_f="4602">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7613" xml_f="7865" txt_i="4602" txt_f="4854">).

Moreover, motivational interventions are well suited for health care settings because they are brief (i.e., usually less than 30 minutes).

Consistent with motivational interviewing techniques, a necessary first step was to engage patients in the identification of the problem behavior — in this case, smoking; as such, teenagers were first screened by providers to ascertain smoking status. Teenagers who reported smoking on 1 or more days in the past 30 days were briefed on the study, and consent and assent were obtained. Initial data were collected using an individual information form that documented the beginning time of screening and general patient demographics. Next, a screening and general assessment form documented teenagers' baseline characteristics, including factors such as smoking rates and previous quit attempts.

Specifically, MTI included patient-tailored personalized feedback on 13 potential topics. Key topics were confidence building, including support and encouragement; feedback on screening and assessment results, including discussion of how their smoking compared with that of the general teenage population (i.e., normative information); discussion of the consequences of smoking, both past and potential; recommendations to reduce or abstain from smoking along with help in making that decision; and goal setting.

Examples of probing questions related to building motivation included: "What do you like about smoking?"; "What do you dislike about smoking?"; and, after the interventionist summarized the patient's dilemma, "Where does that leave you now?" A strategy for dealing with low confidence was to ask: "What is your biggest worry about quitting smoking?" By determining a patient's main concern about quitting, the provider and patient brainstormed meaningful solutions. A final step involved determining whether the patient was ready to set a goal (e.g., quitting, reducing). Information was also tailored to the sex of the patient. Thus, a provider might say to a female patient: "You said you smoke when you feel down. . . . Sometimes girls struggle with this. . . . I have some tips that might help you. . . .

In this context, reduced exposure to smoking and its by-products may be important for smokers who are unable to quit or who are actively trying to quit (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"><offsets xml_i="33399" xml_f="33401" txt_i="27509" txt_f="27511">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33408" xml_f="33632" txt_i="27511" txt_f="27735">). For example, Hatsukami et al found that adult smokers who reduced cigarette use showed significant reductions in lung carcinogen metabolites, suggesting that decreases in carcinogenic uptake can be clinically meaningful (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"><offsets xml_i="33664" xml_f="33666" txt_i="27735" txt_f="27737">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33673" xml_f="33956" txt_i="27737" txt_f="28020">). Moreover, reduction of tobacco use has been considered by some experts as a potential transitional goal toward cessation. As pointed out by O'Leary-Tevyaw and Monti, motivational enhancement may be most effective with excessive behaviors, such as tobacco or other drug addiction (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"><offsets xml_i="33988" xml_f="33990" txt_i="28020" txt_f="28022">37</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33997" xml_f="34461" txt_i="28022" txt_f="28486">). In the present study, the sample included light (one half pack per day), low-nicotine–dependent smokers. Without a doubt, reduced smoking as a harm-reduction approach is not a substitute for complete cessation. Quitting smoking is the only known way to reduce tobacco-related mortality and morbidity. Further research is needed to determine if motivational interviewing may provide opportunities for harm reduction as individuals move toward complete cessation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34483" xml_f="34509" txt_i="28488" txt_f="28514">Challenges and limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34520" xml_f="35299" txt_i="28515" txt_f="29294">Our most critical study barrier was recruitment, particularly related to patient acuity. Almost half of patients who refused to participate did so because of acuity, which was the most cited reason for patient refusal. According to our hospital data, about one fourth of ED patients between the ages of 14 and 18 years are routinely admitted to the hospital for further treatment. Pain, discomfort, and illness severity is largely a subjective experience of the individual. However, even among patients who did not require hospitalization, many reported physical discomfort or emotional stress that hindered their willingness to participate in the study. Beyond physical acuity, many teenagers (27.1%) presented with psychiatric problems, and our providers never approached them.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35306" xml_f="36608" txt_i="29295" txt_f="30597">Obtaining consent and assent for younger teenagers was another study challenge. During the study, 74.7% of the study patients were aged 18 to 19 years, even though only 56.1% of the total age-eligible patients in the ED were between the ages of 18 and 19 years. Only 12.0% of our study patients were younger than 17 years of age. This disproportionate percentage suggests that certain aspects of the process for consenting minors make patient recruitment more difficult in younger patients. This may in part be a result of younger teenagers not wanting their parents to know they smoke. Older teenagers may be less concerned about parental consequences. This is an important consideration for ED-based interventions because a parent or guardian must consent for treatment of a minor. Another limitation is that the majority of study participants were white. Larger, more diverse samples from multiple settings are necessary to make further generalizations about the efficacy and utility of MTI and other motivational interventions. Also, follow-up found low retention rates, presenting potential biases in our data. However, it is important to note that the attrition analyses found no significant differences between teenagers who were absent at 6-month follow-up compared with those who were present.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36615" xml_f="37397" txt_i="30598" txt_f="31380">Motivational approaches are widely accepted in the literature and recommended as potential alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use interventions. However, this approach has been minimally researched as a teenage smoking intervention. Similar to other studies, we found notable reduction in smoking behavior — two times more MTI than BA patients reduced smoking — but no significant differences in cessation. In spite of recommendations to use motivational interviewing methods with teenage smokers, many questions remain, and the current literature lacks trials with significant outcomes in smoking cessation. Motivational interventions have gained attention in the field because, among adults, they have the highest effect sizes among all treatments for alcohol abuse and dependence (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"><offsets xml_i="37429" xml_f="37431" txt_i="31380" txt_f="31382">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37438" xml_f="37439" txt_i="31382" txt_f="31383">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40"><offsets xml_i="37471" xml_f="37473" txt_i="31383" txt_f="31385">40</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37480" xml_f="37635" txt_i="31385" txt_f="31540">). Other research shows that motivational interviewing offers cost-effective alternatives to traditional, longer-term treatments with comparable outcomes (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><offsets xml_i="37667" xml_f="37669" txt_i="31540" txt_f="31542">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37676" xml_f="38411" txt_i="31542" txt_f="32277">). However, the evidence for adolescents is not as solid, and more research is needed to answer numerous questions. Our conclusion is not to suggest that MTI and other motivational interventions are ineffective. Instead, we assert that the current study revealed reductions in tobacco use and lends itself to further study as a harm-reduction model of intervention for teenage smoking. Moreover, more research is needed to examine the suitability of the ED for MTI-type interventions. In particular, the field requires greater understanding of the type of teenage smoker that presents in clinical settings such as the ED, the unique barriers of acuity, and the imminent presence of parents or guardians during the intervention process.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for this study was provided by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (5 R18 HS010736-04).</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sussman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Lichtman</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Ritt</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Pallonen</surname><given-names>UE</given-names></name></person-group><volume>34</volume><issue>11</issue><year>1999</year><fpage>1469</fpage><lpage>1503</lpage><article-title>Effects of thirty-four adolescent tobacco use cessation and prevention trials on regular users of tobacco products</article-title><source>Subst Use Misuse</source><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10468104</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sussman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><volume>1</volume><issue>1</issue><year>2002</year><fpage>35</fpage><lpage>81</lpage><article-title>Effects of sixty six adolescent tobacco use cessation trials and seventeen prospective studies of self-initiated quitting.
