In these trials it is difficult to achieve both high internal validity and high generalisability. This article will discuss several methodological challenges in designing and conducting a pragmatic primary care based randomised controlled trial, based on our experiences in the DIAMOND-study and will discuss the rationale behind the choices we made.

By adding treatment steps to one treatment arm and adding placebo to both treatment arms both internal and external validity were optimized. Nevertheless, although blinding is essential for a high internal validity, it should be warily considered in a pragmatic trial because it decreases external validity. Choosing and recruiting a representative selection of participants was the second challenge. We succeeded in retrieving a representative relatively large patient sample by carefully choosing (few) inclusion and exclusion criteria, by random selection, by paying much attention to participant recruitment and taking the participant's reasons to participate into account. Good and regular contact with the GPs and patients was to our opinion essential. The third challenge was to choose the primary outcome, which needed to reflect effectiveness of the treatment in every day practice. We also designed our protocol to follow every day practice as much as possible, although standardized treatment is usually preferred in trials. The aim of this was our fourth challenge: to limit the number of protocol deviations and increase external validity.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6778" xml_f="6785" txt_i="1947" txt_f="1954">Summary</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6796" xml_f="7198" txt_i="1955" txt_f="2357">It is challenging to design and conduct a pragmatic trial.

Researchers face a number of methodological challenges and need to make several choices in the design and conduct of pragmatic trials. This is especially true for primary care based trials where the broad spectrum of disease presentation and early clinical stage challenges the selection of an adequate study population. Though these challenges greatly influence the external and internal validity as well as the eventual significance of the study results, most publications do not elaborate on the choices made. This paper discusses several challenges in designing and conducting pragmatic primary care based trials we experienced in a large scale multicentre randomised trial on dyspepsia. This might be helpful for other researchers especially in the planning stage of new trials. Our objective is to contribute to quality improvement of pragmatic primary care based trials.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8623" xml_f="9379" txt_i="3599" txt_f="4355">This paper will discuss three challenges in designing a study: choosing the right intervention and blinding treatment allocation, choosing an appropriate study population, and choosing the essential outcome measures. Subsequently the challenges in conducting a study will be discussed focusing on recruitment of participating general practitioners (GPs) and patients, and on dealing with protocol deviations. Each section will start with a brief introduction of pitfalls in general, followed by the rationale behind the choices made within the DIAMOND-study and a speculation of the consequences of our choices. The paper will end with conclusions describing the consequences of our choices for the expected usefulness and relevance of the DIAMOND results.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9395" xml_f="9412" txt_i="4356" txt_f="4373">The DIAMOND trial</offsets></title><p><italic><offsets xml_i="9431" xml_f="9962" txt_i="4374" txt_f="4905">The Dutch study of InitiAl Management Of Newly diagnosed Dyspepsia (DIAMOND) investigates the effectiveness of two treatment strategies for dyspepsia: the step-up treatment strategy and the step-down treatment.

We visited the GPs after each new included patient to collect the patient's blood sample and provide new materials. The purpose of this visit was to reinforce the patient inclusion, but not to discuss how the included patient was treated to avoid an extra educational intervention. Furthermore, a monthly newsletter was sent to the GPs to remind them and to keep them posted.

Maybe in the near future easier ways to monitor complaints and retrieve important data (e.g. via the internet) will become accessible and can facilitate patient cooperation and prevent drop-out</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="50425" xml_f="50426" txt_i="39428" txt_f="39429">.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="50454" xml_f="50541" txt_i="39432" txt_f="39519">The consequences of our choices for the usefulness and relevance of the DIAMOND results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="50552" xml_f="51292" txt_i="39520" txt_f="40260">The results of this study are useful/relevant for policy makers, patients, GPs and researchers because a large population of well defined patients, which is generalisable to the Dutch population of patients with a new episode of dyspeptic symptoms. The study has a high internal validity because of the random treatment allocation, and the concealment of treatment allocation/blinding, which increases the value of the results for policy makers. However, the external validity is decreased by the use of step-down treatment instead of PPI-treatment (which is more common in every day practice) and by the blinding. Consequently, it is difficult to say what the effect of both treatment strategies will be if performed in every day practice.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51299" xml_f="52331" txt_i="40261" txt_f="41293">In order to adapt the study protocol to routine daily practice, a multistep protocol was designed. Although this resembles everyday practice it makes analysis more difficult, because not all patients are in the same treatment step at a certain point in time, and because the period of time between finishing the trial medication and registration of the primary outcome may vary from patient to patient. In case this period is long, the primary outcome may be influenced by follow-up treatment chosen by the GP. This may decrease any differences between the treatment strategies, but on the other hand the primary outcome does provide essential information about the effectiveness of actual primary care treatment for dyspepsia. Furthermore, the differences between the two treatment strategies can be analyzed in more detail by analyzing the secondary endpoints (at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, etc...). Therefore, the trial design as presented will provide important insights in various strategies for treatment of dyspepsia in primary care.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="52359" xml_f="52366" txt_i="41296" txt_f="41303">Summary</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="52377" xml_f="52497" txt_i="41304" txt_f="41424">Pragmatic trials must ensure a high generalisability without compromising internal validity, which is very challenging [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"><offsets xml_i="52529" xml_f="52531" txt_i="41424" txt_f="41426">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="52538" xml_f="53606" txt_i="41426" txt_f="42494">]. Therefore, a critical appraisal of the planned design and method to conduct the trial before actually starting to collect data is essential. When several publications on patient recruitment or other pitfalls in designing/conducting a pragmatic trial are consulted, one may increase the likelihood of conducting a successful trial. Furthermore, it is very important to set priorities beforehand where on the 'spectrum from explanatory to pragmatic' you want your trial to be: do you want to know the "unbiased" effect of the treatment (as in explanatory trials) or are you more interested in the effects in daily primary care (as in pragmatic trials)? For instance, we chose to blind treatment allocation because otherwise prejudices of GPs, patients and researchers might have biased the results, although blinding contrasts with the purpose to reflect every day practice in pragmatic trials. On the other hand, we chose to use flexible treatment protocol to reflect every practice, what again might contrast with using standardized treatment in explanatory trials.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="53613" xml_f="54377" txt_i="42495" txt_f="43259">This paper shows that while we did not compare the two most frequently used treatment strategies in the DIAMOND-study, we were still able to collect highly valid data because of the blinded randomised treatment, the randomly selected heterogeneous patient sample and the research protocol that closely fits to normal practice. Although it is very difficult to recruit as many GPs and patients as needed, success can be determined by careful consideration of how the GPs and patients will be optimally recruited and what their reasons to participate or to refuse participation will be. Our experiences with the DIAMOND-study give an indication of what success rates regarding GP and patient recruitment and questionnaire response can be expected in similar studies.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="54399" xml_f="54418" txt_i="43261" txt_f="43280">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="54429" xml_f="54489" txt_i="43281" txt_f="43341">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="54511" xml_f="54533" txt_i="43343" txt_f="43365">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="54544" xml_f="54832" txt_i="43366" txt_f="43654">GF, CVM and SM designed the study, collected the data and performed statistical analysis.
