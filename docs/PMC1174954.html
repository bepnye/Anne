The primary aims were to detect differences in symptoms and function. Patients were randomized to once-daily risedronate (5 mg or 15 mg) or placebo. Radiographs were taken at baseline and 1 year for assessment of joint-space width using a standardized radiographic method with fluoroscopic positioning of the joint. Pain, function, and stiffness were assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) OA index. The patient global assessment and use of walking aids were measured and bone and cartilage markers were assessed. The intention-to-treat population consisted of 284 patients.

In contrast, only limited data are available about therapies that modify the course of the disease or affect joint structure. Historically, OA has been considered a disease of the cartilage, but more recent evidence suggests that subchrondral bone is also involved in the pathogenesis, in both disease initiation and progression. For example, increased local bone turnover, decreased bone mineral content and stiffness, and decreased trabecular numbers have been observed in OA subchondral bone structure compared with normal bone [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="8220" xml_f="8221" txt_i="3609" txt_f="3610">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8228" xml_f="8229" txt_i="3610" txt_f="3611">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="8260" xml_f="8261" txt_i="3611" txt_f="3612">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8268" xml_f="8479" txt_i="3612" txt_f="3823">].
