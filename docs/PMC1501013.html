However, the effect of a low frequency walking prescription on fitness in younger adults remains to be investigated. Furthermore, the effects of low frequency, moderate intensity training on other markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have received very little attention.

During the intervention, walkers significantly increased the total number of steps taken on Walk-days compared to Rest-days, indicating greater amounts of activity as a result of the walking programme. However, in the present study, there was a significant difference between the number of voluntary steps taken on Walk-days compared to the number of steps taken on Rest-days. This suggests that employees decreased their non-programme activity during Walk-days.

This walking prescription, however, failed to induce significant improvements in fitness, diastolic BP, body mass, serum lipids and CRP levels. The walking programme was associated with high adherence. These findings support the use of a twice-weekly, self-paced, worksite based, walking programme, to improve activity levels and systolic BP in previously sedentary employees. There is little evidence however to support the use of this exercise prescription for improvements in other markers of CVD risk. This walking prescription may therefore be useful as a stepping-stone to further increase levels of exercise, which may then provide greater benefits.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33035" xml_f="33054" txt_i="26428" txt_f="26447">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33065" xml_f="33125" txt_i="26448" txt_f="26508">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33147" xml_f="33169" txt_i="26510" txt_f="26532">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33180" xml_f="33242" txt_i="26533" txt_f="26595">MHM, EMM and CAGB were responsible for the design of the study</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33249" xml_f="33288" txt_i="26596" txt_f="26635">EMM was responsible for data collection</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33295" xml_f="33334" txt_i="26636" txt_f="26675">LGH was responsible for blood profiling</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33341" xml_f="33385" txt_i="26676" txt_f="26720">AMN was responsible for statistical analysis</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33392" xml_f="33449" txt_i="26721" txt_f="26778">MHM and EMM were responsible for preparing the manuscript</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33456" xml_f="33506" txt_i="26779" txt_f="26829">All authors read and approved the final manuscript</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33528" xml_f="33551" txt_i="26831" txt_f="26854">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33562" xml_f="33626" txt_i="26855" txt_f="26919">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/6/136/prepub"></ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Grainne McCurry, Pat Polin and Sioban Ritchie of the Northern Ireland Civil Service for assistance in setting up the intervention, and Gillian Stanage for help with data collection.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Health Promotion Agency</collab></person-group><source>A health economics model.
