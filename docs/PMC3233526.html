None of the participating women were vegetarians, and all were informed regarding proper dietary composition during pregnancy. In accordance with Islamic law, which does not allow pregnant women to fast, none were fasting.

Moreover, such approaches may not be safe in all circumstances, as shown by studies demonstrating an adverse effect on pregnancy outcome in women with higher hemoglobin levels who receive iron supplementation. Currently there is no general solution for this worldwide problem, which rather emphasizes the need for careful evaluation of target populations with respect to social, dietary, and religious customs, and in particular the need for an individual approach in each pregnant woman. Rigid iron supplementation rules based on inaccurate generalizations from studies conducted in different global and political regions in different ethnic populations and sometimes in a different decade may eventually cause harm instead of benefit in a subset of pregnant women and their babies.</offsets></p><p></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We would like to thank
