Students were divided into two groups, one who received an introductory hands-on session about the electronic evaluation portfolio and one who did not. Students' marks in their portfolios were compared between both groups. Additionally, students self-evaluated their performance and received feedback using the electronic portfolio during their mandatory clerkship rotation. Students were surveyed immediately after the rotation and at the end of the clerkship year. Tutors' opinions about this method were surveyed once. Finally, the number of evaluations/month was quantified.

This paper presents the results of the evaluation of the MEEP. In conducting our evaluation, we hypothesized, first, that students may require an effective hands-on introduction into the use of portfolios in order to improve their performance in the MEEP as a new evaluation and learning method. Second, we also hypothesized that the MEEP as a web-based system may facilitate the process of evaluation in clinical settings where time constraints pose a significant limitation, improving student and tutor perceptions of the evaluation process and finally increasing the number of tutor-student interactions.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="9396" xml_f="9403" txt_i="4923" txt_f="4930">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9414" xml_f="9656" txt_i="4931" txt_f="5173">The MEEP is a web-based portfolio that has been integrated into the clerkship using WebCT, Inc.'s course management system (WebCT) as its main platform.

Briefly, the MEEP includes a list of ten skills and eight attitudes in which the students are expected to demonstrate the acquisition of competence during a four-week rotation. Students may post their self-reflections and action plans every time they perform one of the skills or are exposed to an attitude-related situation while dealing with geriatric patients. Working from input from the students and feedback from their tutors and members of the multidisciplinary team (nurses, social workers, physiotherapists, etc.), the system tracks the skills and attitudes that they have completed, are working on, and have not yet performed to give them real-time feedback on their progress. Tutors post feedback and comments to their assigned students' portfolios as well as observe and contribute to the feedback and comments given to students they are not assigned to evaluate, but with whom they may interact.

By contrast, the attitudes only had a qualitative value in the global evaluation of the student. For 80% of the final grade, students were evaluated based on traditional tutor-led lecture and teaching sessions, specifically using the evaluation report known as the Practice of Medicine (POM) evaluation form, a rating form used in most of the clinical clerkships at McGill University whose categories run from Unsatisfactory to Superior [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="11501" xml_f="11502" txt_i="6905" txt_f="6906">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11509" xml_f="11511" txt_i="6906" txt_f="6908">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11518" xml_f="11565" txt_i="6909" txt_f="6956">The study participants were McGill University 3</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="11570" xml_f="11573" txt_i="6956" txt_f="6959">rd </offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="11579" xml_f="12312" txt_i="6959" txt_f="7692">year medical students completing their mandatory four-week clerkship rotation in Geriatric Medicine. On the first day of each rotation, students in one group attended an introductory session given by the clerkship coordinator. This session took place in a computer laboratory equipped with personal stations allowing for hands-on practice with the portfolio and the web-based system. To test if this introductory session had an effect on the students' ability to work with the portfolio, the introductory session was not given to 50% of the rotation periods, which were randomly selected.

Furthermore, a thirty-question mandatory electronic survey was completed by the students at the end of their rotation which included the global assessment of their experience in Geriatric Medicine. Among those thirty questions, three questions were dedicated to soliciting their opinions about the MEEP. Additionally, a second optional survey was sent to the same set of students at the end of the clerkship year. This second survey consisted of thirty-six questions, including the same three questions asked on the first survey concerning the MEEP. In the first two questions, a five-point Likert scale ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree" was used.

To assess the user-friendliness of this method, students were asked to rate how comfortable they felt using the MEEP. The initial survey immediately after the rotation showed that of students attending introductory sessions, 66% "strongly" or "somewhat agree" to feeling comfortable using the MEEP, while among those who did not attend intro sessions, only 48% reported "strong" to "somewhat" agreement that they were comfortable with the MEEP (p &lt; 0.05).

Within these evaluations, students and tutors are expected to write comments and action plans that stimulate further self-reflection and on-site learning thus transforming the e-portfolio from a static repository into a dynamic cycle of evaluation fed by student-tutor interaction thus increasing the immediacy of the feedback [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="19665" xml_f="19666" txt_i="14295" txt_f="14296">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19673" xml_f="19675" txt_i="14296" txt_f="14298">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19682" xml_f="20397" txt_i="14299" txt_f="15014">To address our first hypothesis we found that student performance in the portfolio was worse and the experience was considered less comfortable when they did not receive the introductory session. The difference in student performance in the portfolio after the implementation of the introductory session may be explained by the fact that despite the information available on our website, students reacted better to using the MEEP because they received a more dynamic explanation of it and were able to ask questions thus better understanding its value to the skill development process. As expected, this introductory session did not have an effect on students performance in their tutor-led evaluations (POM forms).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20404" xml_f="21665" txt_i="15015" txt_f="16276">Our second goal was to identify the effect of the MEEP on the learning environment by examining its user-friendliness and acceptance as a new evaluation method. In some cases, Geriatric Medicine was the students' first clinical rotation leaving some students with no benchmark for comparing their experience with other types of evaluation when answering the final survey. To reduce the effect of that handicap, we administered a second evaluative survey to identify any change in opinion about the portfolio after one year of clerkship rotations. In this study, there is a positive change over time in student conceptions of the MEEP as an evaluation method with more students considering the MEEP to be very good or excellent. Additionally, there was also a significant positive change in the number of students who feel comfortable using the MEEP. Finally, there was a slight change in student perceptions of this evaluation portfolio as a tool for more effective feedback when compared with the traditional evaluation system. However, we do not consider these results to be surprising with respect to the MEEP's acceptance because these results correlate with student perceptions of other traditional methods of evaluation such as multiple choice questions [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="21697" xml_f="21699" txt_i="16276" txt_f="16278">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21706" xml_f="21892" txt_i="16278" txt_f="16464">]. Furthermore, the student evaluations of the portfolios were not affected by the order of the clerkship rotations being similar in earlier or later clerks throughout the academic year.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21899" xml_f="22431" txt_i="16465" txt_f="16997">Additionally, we surveyed the tutors in an attempt to determine their acceptance to this method and the potential limitations to their use of the portfolio. In general, the method was well accepted by the tutors. Indeed, we found that time (or lack thereof) was the main limitation to the tutors' ability to use the electronic portfolio and to provide more frequent feedback. This means that while the MEEP does not solve all time constraints, tutor limitations to the MEEP do not relate largely to the general system of evaluation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22438" xml_f="23145" txt_i="16998" txt_f="17705">Finally, we would like to underscore the significant change in the learning environment represented by the quantity of the student and tutor postings. We think that this is the most important strength of this method since very few evaluation methods provide such a number of evaluation events (thirty evaluative postings with feedback) in a short period of time (one month). Since only students evaluations that included comments and action plans were accepted as valid, we found that every posted evaluation represented an active exercise of self-reflection that is usually wanting in other evaluation methods. A good example of the quality of the self-reflection process is shown in our sample portfolio [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="23176" xml_f="23177" txt_i="17705" txt_f="17706">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23184" xml_f="23186" txt_i="17706" txt_f="17708">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23193" xml_f="23650" txt_i="17709" txt_f="18166">A potential limitation to our study is that the improvement in the MEEP's acceptance using student survey data after one year may be due to a regression phenomenon. However, we consider that limitation to be mitigated by including the set of students who completed geriatrics as the last rotation of the academic year and who had already experienced all other traditional and new evaluation methods in their previous clerkship rotations throughout the year.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23657" xml_f="24149" txt_i="18167" txt_f="18659">A second limitation is the fact that tutors postings do not necessarily follow the students self-assessment limiting the effectiveness of the tool as a negotiated-learning tool. However, we found in both feedback surveys, from tutors and students, that they recognize the complementarity of this tool to the usual daily interactions between tutors and students. In fact, in some cases tutors sat down with their students to fill out their MEEP evaluations and to go over their list of skills.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24156" xml_f="24592" txt_i="18660" txt_f="19096">In summary, an analysis of our findings shows that although an introductory session is required, the MEEP is a new evaluation method that encourages student self-reflection, tracks student progress in skill acquisition and stimulates student-tutor interaction with a high level of acceptance by tutors and students. Moreover, this tool may represent a valuable complement to the most traditional evaluation systems in clinical settings.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24614" xml_f="24633" txt_i="19098" txt_f="19117">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="24644" xml_f="24704" txt_i="19118" txt_f="19178">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24726" xml_f="24748" txt_i="19180" txt_f="19202">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="24759" xml_f="25355" txt_i="19203" txt_f="19799">GD conceived of the study, participated in the conception and design of the portfolio and helped draft the manuscript.
