Neither our study nor LAP-07 recommended continuation of chemotherapy after chemoradiotherapy, because chemotherapy was given upfront in both. Whether recommencement of chemotherapy after chemoradiotherapy would provide additional benefit remains unknown. Nevertheless, in our trial, durable disease control was achieved with a median progression-free survival of 12 months in the capecitabine-based chemoradiation group. This finding suggests that in appropriately selected patients chemoradiotherapy can effectively delay tumour progression, even if chemotherapy is not recommenced.

Although our results show a clinically relevant difference in overall survival between capecitabine-based and gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy, this finding should be interpreted cautiously since this outcome was not the primary endpoint and the number of patients included in the trial was small. Data for second-line treatment after disease progression were not obtained and an imbalance between the groups in terms of the proportion of patients who received second-line treatment might have affected the survival outcomes. Moreover, although randomised, the Fleming's design is not ideal for a direct comparison between the groups, and the trial would not have been adequately powered to detect a difference in overall survival as the primary endpoint. We also acknowledge the limitations of progression-free survival as an endpoint for pancreatic cancer—since the primary tumour has diffuse margins, accurate measurement of local progression is difficult. However, nearly 70% of the patients had new-onset metastatic disease at progression.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45623" xml_f="46333" txt_i="34575" txt_f="35285">The trial protocol did not specify the criteria for inoperability, with this decision left to the locoregional pancreatic team (including the surgeon and specialist radiologist), in recognition of the variability in surgical practice. Most surgeons in the UK follow National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidance and we expect that this guidance was applied, although no central review of radiology took place. However, the protocol did specify that all patients had to be discussed at the multidisciplinary team meeting after chemoradiotherapy and be reassessed for operability.

The combination of radiotherapy with capecitabine was less toxic than the combination with gemcitabine, despite gemcitabine being given at a fairly low dose. This benefit was achieved with no compromise in progression-free survival and local control, and an apparent improvement in overall survival. Notwithstanding the small number of patients in this trial, the good efficacy and toxicity profile seems to favour capecitabine for combination with radiotherapy in this setting, which suggests that capecitabine could be favoured as a template regimen in trials to assess new radiosensitisers or radiotherapy dose escalation.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Cancer Research UK</collab></person-group><article-title>Pancreatic cancer statistics</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/pancreas/?script=true" id="interref3">http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/pancreas/?script=true</ext-link><comment>(accessed Feb 19, 2013).</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hidalgo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pancreatic cancer</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><volume>362</volume><year>2010</year><fpage>1605</fpage><lpage>1617</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20427809</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Burris</surname><given-names>HA</given-names><suffix>3rd</suffix></name><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Improvements in survival and clinical benefit with gemcitabine as first-line therapy for patients with advanced pancreas cancer: a randomized trial</article-title><source>J Clin Oncol</source><volume>15</volume><year>1997</year><fpage>2403</fpage><lpage>2413</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9196156</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group</collab></person-group><article-title>Treatment of locally unresectable carcinoma of the pancreas: comparison of combined-modality therapy (chemotherapy plus radiotherapy) to chemotherapy alone</article-title><source>J Natl Cancer Inst</source><volume>80</volume><year>1988</year><fpage>751</fpage><lpage>755</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2898536</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Louvet</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Labianca</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammel</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin compared with gemcitabine alone in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer: results of a GERCOR and GISCAD phase III trial</article-title><source>J Clin Oncol</source><volume>23</volume><year>2005</year><fpage>3509</fpage><lpage>3516</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15908661</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref6"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moertel</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Frytak</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Therapy of locally unresectable pancreatic carcinoma: a randomized comparison of high dose (6000 rads) radiation alone, moderate dose radiation (4000 rads + 5-fluorouracil), and high dose radiation + 5-fluorouracil.

No randomised controlled trials or retrospective studies compared gemcitabine-based with capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy. We identified two randomised trials<xref rid="bib19 bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,21</sup></xref> that compared gemcitabine-based with fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy and one<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> that compared gemcitabine-based with paclitaxel-based chemoradiotherapy. We also identified one meta-analysis<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> that compared gemcitabine-based with fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy. This meta-analysis included one additional randomised trial<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> that was not identified in the original PubMed search, and therefore included three randomised trials and one retrospective comparative study,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> with a total of 229 patients. The results showed an overall survival advantage for gemcitabine compared with fluorouracil at 12 months from randomisation (risk ratio 1·54, 95% CI 1·05–2·26, p=0·03). Severe haematological toxic effects were more frequent in the gemcitabine group.</p><p><bold>Interpretation</bold></p><p>The higher toxicity of gemcitabine compared with the fluorouracil prodrug capecitabine seen in our study is consistent with previous research. However, by contrast with previous evidence, our results seem to show a survival advantage from capecitabine-based compared with gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy. Although these data should be interpreted with caution, because the difference in the primary endpoint was non-significant and the number of patients small, in the setting of induction chemotherapy, capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy is safe and effective and might be preferable to gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.</p></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
