As a registered nurse and a diabetes specialist nurse with extensive knowledge of the health care system, the first author had some expectations in terms of the kinds of barriers one could face when introducing a new tool in diabetes care.

A constant comparison method was used to compare the different pieces and patterns in each interview. Open coding was used to capture issues and ideas in the data. The process was done by coding terms that were as broad-based as possible to avoid premature closure on interpretation in accordance with the ID approach.

The interactive web based ulcer record supported their systematic wound assessment, helping them in what to consider as relevant in wound care, and the use of this web based ulcer record facilitated an increased dialogue and reflection around wound treatment among health care professionals. They held the belief that, as a result of the intervention, they were better at seeing factors around the patient which might affect the wound and the treatment, such as the diabetes disease, nutrition and exercise.

The use of images combined with text made the clinical issues much more visible and therefore understandable to them all. They had much to say about passing on knowledge to those working in primary health care by using this web based ulcer record. Some examples illustrate. As one specialist health care nurse explained:</offsets><disp-quote><p><italic><offsets xml_i="22759" xml_f="23054" txt_i="15591" txt_f="15886">“Maybe they can learn from our wound assessments that there are other things as well, which should be considered in wound treatment.

This aspect was spoken about frequently in the focus groups, and can be summarized as: </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="24429" xml_f="24534" txt_i="17182" txt_f="17287">“I find it easier to discuss with my colleagues when we can look at the same picture back at the office.”</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="24543" xml_f="24889" txt_i="17287" txt_f="17633"> They expressed that they developed a mutual clinical language with the specialist health care when using telemedicine. This seemed to enhance their wound assessment skills. It also seemed to those involved in telemedicine that the level of interest in the work of foot ulcers of other colleagues not involved in the intervention was increasing: </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="24897" xml_f="25058" txt_i="17633" txt_f="17794">“They are more interested now, because of the images I have showed them, they have asked more and have been much more eager to learn more about wound treatment.”</offsets></italic></p><p><offsets xml_i="25074" xml_f="25763" txt_i="17795" txt_f="18484">Using images and words together in the documentation gave the health care professionals a tool which enabled them to discuss and reflect upon wound treatment with other colleagues who hadn’t seen a particular diabetic foot ulcer previously. Discussion and reflection with colleagues led to an increased interest in diabetic foot ulcer treatment and learning new skills, both of which also spilled over to colleagues not involved in the intervention. On the other hand, health care professionals working in outpatient hospital clinics did not find this to represent a significant change in practice. They were accustomed to discussing such issues with one another more often during the day.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25770" xml_f="26334" txt_i="18485" txt_f="19049">The participants in primary health care and specialist health care experienced increased confidence as health care professionals with better skills in wound assessment. This increased confidence made them more accurate and clear in the language they used in discussions with other health care professionals. They dared to disagree and keep on with the discussion when it was important. All of this made them a more competent health care professional in their own eyes.

The web based ulcer record required that health care professionals follow the same standards in reporting their findings. This feature seemed to direct attention to aspects of primary concern in the web based ulcer record. It was commented upon in this way in some focus groups in outpatient hospital clinics:</offsets><disp-quote><p><italic><offsets xml_i="26968" xml_f="27144" txt_i="19620" txt_f="19796">“…with this new tool we use now, it is easier to systematize and map our wound assessments.

The documentation became more precise both in structure and content as a result of the technological innovation. The high level of enthusiasm outpatient hospital clinic professionals had about this aspect was apparent in the lively nature of their dialogue in several of the focus groups. As one commented: </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="28162" xml_f="28315" txt_i="20735" txt_f="20888">“The notes are quite different after we started using telemedicine.

First of all, the health care professionals involved found the telemedicine equipment and the web based ulcer record easy to learn and use. Few technological problems occurred during this initial phase. Furthermore, the participants received technical support quickly from more experienced people at the outpatient specialist health care setting. Many of them had completed advanced courses during recent years in wound treatment, and were highly motivated and enthusiastic when starting to use telemedicine. This together with being followed up by specialists when they were using this wound journal made them more confident in what to document. The participants also experienced that their suggestions for improvements on the technology were taken into account and improvements were made.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29479" xml_f="30182" txt_i="22014" txt_f="22717">On the other hand it was a generally held view that the documentation process was too time consuming because they had to do double documentation. This was due to journal systems which were not integrated with each other. In primary health care some participants were told by the management not to use much time in documenting at all because it would take time from other tasks. They also experienced that other colleagues commented negatively on time spent with documentation and tasks related to telemedicine. Some of them expressed that documenting in the web based ulcer record and using the telemedicine equipment gave them more responsibility than the rest of the staff and not everyone liked that.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title><offsets xml_i="30215" xml_f="30295" txt_i="22719" txt_f="22799">Streamlined communication between primary health care and specialist health care</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="30306" xml_f="30813" txt_i="22800" txt_f="23307">The final main benefit that the health care professionals spoke of was the intervention’s effect on streamlining communication between their two sectors. In most of the non- specialist settings that these professionals represented, one or two selected nurses were assigned the responsibility for using the telemedicine equipment to transfer images of the foot ulcer captured by mobile telephone for assessment. These nurses could then perform wound care in cooperation with the specialist health care staff.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30820" xml_f="31123" txt_i="23308" txt_f="23611">The participants in both primary health care and specialist health care experienced that this contributed to streamlining the communication between them.

A strength in this study is that the participants varied in their place of work, working experience with foot ulcers, their age and their profession, thereby proving a wide variety of experiences and perspectives on the use of telemedicine.

Furthermore, our findings also demonstrate that participants involved in telemedicine intervention can develop as health care professionals.
