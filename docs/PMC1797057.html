The increasing paperwork surrounding the conduct of clinical trials following the introduction of the EU Clinical Trials Directive, and the implementation of the Research Governance Framework in the UK means that much of this process is not optional. The set-up of this feasibility study coincided with the introduction of the new electronic form for ethics applications, and there were inevitable teething problems associated with this development. In addition, at the time of this research, many hospital Trusts were not accepting the standard R&amp;D application form, thus making the R&amp;D approval process even more difficult. Considerable efforts have since been made to streamline the approval process in the UK. Developments such as the on-line standard R&amp;D form and the plans to subsume site specific ethical review within the local R&amp;D approval process are to be welcomed.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26917" xml_f="26947" txt_i="17921" txt_f="17951">2) Recruitment of participants</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26958" xml_f="27462" txt_i="17952" txt_f="18456">Recruitment for the pilot study was at approximately 1 patient per centre per month (15 per month in total). However, the impact of applying exclusion criteria for the RCT meant that this figure was dramatically reduced. Of the 100 participants originally approached about the study, only 26 (26%) fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were willing to be randomised to treatment. In addition, the impact of a more stringent definition of cellulitis means that this figure could be reduced still further.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27469" xml_f="28586" txt_i="18457" txt_f="19574">Investigators also reported that locating patients was difficult. This has worrying implications for an RCT involving patients with cellulitis who are recruited by dermatologists in a secondary care setting. It is important to understand why identifying patients with such a common condition could be so difficult. Feedback from the recruiting centres suggests that one of the most important limiting factors for recruitment was that patients were not routinely treated by dermatologists. Patients were seen by many different disciplines (general medicine, infection control, emergency medicine, geriatrics); were admitted through various routes; and were often moved or discharged at short notice. In addition, 6 centres established a new system of community-based care during the period of the pilot study. This meant that fewer patients were treated for cellulitis in hospital and those that were admitted were more likely to have multiple co-morbidities, or to have cognitive impairment, making them unsuitable for inclusion in a trial. It is likely that other hospitals will adopt similar policies in the future.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28593" xml_f="29163" txt_i="19575" txt_f="20145">The solution to different routes of admission for recruitment seems to vary from hospital to hospital: providing greater administrative support; posters on relevant wards; identification of a link person (who may be a registrar or research nurse, rather than necessarily the consultant); tracking admissions from admission ward/casualty department records; identification from clinical coding records; and 'advertising' by a specific discussion of the study at a postgraduate meeting or reminders at directorate meetings are all possible methods to increase recruitment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="29185" xml_f="29216" txt_i="20147" txt_f="20178">3) Inclusion/exclusion criteria</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29227" xml_f="29845" txt_i="20179" txt_f="20797">Inclusion into the RCT will be based on a diagnosis of cellulitis of the leg. However, cellulitis is a difficult diagnosis to confirm by bacteriology and no guidelines exist relating to clinical criteria for entry into trials. Obviously for any future trials a balance must be struck between the specificity and sensitivity of the chosen inclusion criteria. Similarly, the impact of possible exclusion criteria was high. In particular, 14 (20%) of those recruited into the pilot were allergic to penicillin, and a further 13 (19%) had a preceding ulcer, both of which are planned exclusion criteria for the future RCT.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="29867" xml_f="29906" txt_i="20799" txt_f="20838">4) Primary outcome – time to recurrence</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29917" xml_f="30394" txt_i="20839" txt_f="21316">Data relating to time to recurrence suggest that the majority of patients have a subsequent episode within a time frame suitable for capture within the duration of a trial, (indeed 75% occurred within 12 months of the previous episode). In the 22 (32%) of participants who had experienced a previous attack, the median time to recurrence was 205 days (95% CI 102 to 308). This supports the need for medium-term therapy for the 6 to 12 months period immediately after an attack.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="30416" xml_f="30441" txt_i="21318" txt_f="21343">5) Views of service users</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="30452" xml_f="30728" txt_i="21344" txt_f="21620">Most participants were supportive of the trial, particularly if they had experienced several episodes of cellulitis in the past.
