There is considerable interest in the general hypothesis that improving the diet of older people may slow the progression of cognitive decline. To date, there has been little attention given to the possible protective role of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPs) most commonly found in oily fish, in age-related loss of cognitive function. The main research hypothesis of this study is that an increased dietary intake of n-3 LCPs will have a positive effect on cognitive performance in older people in the UK.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7002" xml_f="7663" txt_i="650" txt_f="1311">To test this hypothesis, a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial will be carried out among adults aged 70–79 years in which the intervention arm will receive daily capsules containing n-3 LCP (0.5 g/day docosahexaenoic acid and 0.2 g/day eicosapentaenoic acid) while the placebo arm will receive daily capsules containing olive oil. The main outcome variable assessed at 24 months will be cognitive performance and a second major outcome variable will be retinal function.

It is thought that this results from the ability of n-3 LCPs (specifically DHA) in rod outer segments of the retina, to enhance photoreceptor signal transduction processing.

Part of this decreased sensitivity may be associated with reduction in DHA levels, such as also occurs in the ageing brain, and may be susceptible to dietary manipulation.

The intervention arm will be asked to consume two 650 mg soft-gel capsules daily containing a total of 500 mg DHA and 200 mg EPA. This is equivalent to approximately 4.9 g of n-3 LCPs a week (0.7 g/day), a level that can be achieved via the consumption of approximately 300 g (slightly more than 2 portions) of fatty-fish a week. This level of supplementation falls well below the upper GRAS level and should thus be safe. The placebo arm will be asked to consume two identical 650 mg capsules containing olive oil daily, this oil is rich in n-9 fatty acids and will thus have a minimal effect on the 18:2 n-6/18:3 n-3 ratio. Changes in the n-6/n-3 ratio may affect prostanoid balance which affects vascular and inflammatory responses. The higher DHA to EPA ratio in the supplement is justified by the rationale of the study, which prioritises the neuroprotective effect of DHA over the vascular and anti-thrombotic effect of EPA.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29258" xml_f="29763" txt_i="20830" txt_f="21335">The research nurses will explain the importance of consuming the capsules every day, suggesting that it should become part of their daily routine, for example by always consuming the capsules at breakfast-time.

Full electroretinogram (ERG): the ERG is a mass electrical response of the retina to a luminance stimulus. It is recorded through an electrode placed on the surface of the eye, light stimuli are provided using a Ganzfeld dome stimulator. The response typically consists of an "a-wave" followed by a "b-wave". The first 10–12 milliseconds of the a-wave arises in relation to photoreceptor hyperpolarisation, and the slope of the linear portion of the a-wave can be related to the kinetics of phototransduction. The b-wave is generated in the inner nuclear layer of the retina, principally the ON-bipolar cells. Further recording will examine the a-wave evoked by a brighter flash specifically to examine the characteristics that can be related to phototransduction.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38054" xml_f="38351" txt_i="29108" txt_f="29405">2.

There is a growing body of mechanistic and epidemiologic evidence to support the proposal that n-3 LCPs may reduce the risk of age-related loss of cognitive function in older people. The current trial is designed to test the hypothesis that an increased dietary intake of n-3 LCPs will have a positive effect on cognitive performance in older people in the UK. This will be the first trial of its kind aiming to slow the decline of neuronal function in older people by increasing daily dietary intake of n-3 LCPs. The link between cognitive ability and quality of life among older people suggests that this novel line of research may have considerable public health importance.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="51212" xml_f="51225" txt_i="41356" txt_f="41369">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="51236" xml_f="51267" txt_i="41370" txt_f="41401">DCC – Data Co-ordinating Centre</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51274" xml_f="51300" txt_i="41402" txt_f="41428">DHA – docosahexaenoic acid</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51307" xml_f="51338" txt_i="41429" txt_f="41460">DMC – Data Monitoring Committee</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51345" xml_f="51372" txt_i="41461" txt_f="41488">EPA – eicosapentaenoic acid</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51379" xml_f="51402" txt_i="41489" txt_f="41512">ERG – electroretinogram</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51409" xml_f="51454" txt_i="41513" txt_f="41558">GHQ-30 – 30-item General Health Questionnaire</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51461" xml_f="51503" txt_i="41559" txt_f="41601">GPRF – General Practice Research Framework</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51510" xml_f="51545" txt_i="41602" txt_f="41637">GRAS – Generally recognised as safe</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51552" xml_f="51578" txt_i="41638" txt_f="41664">MI – Myocardial infarction</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51585" xml_f="51621" txt_i="41665" txt_f="41701">MMSE – Mini Mental State Examination</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51628" xml_f="51681" txt_i="41702" txt_f="41755">n-3 LCPs – n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51688" xml_f="51718" txt_i="41756" txt_f="41786">PMG – Project Management Group</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="51740" xml_f="51759" txt_i="41788" txt_f="41807">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="51770" xml_f="51830" txt_i="41808" txt_f="41868">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="51852" xml_f="51874" txt_i="41870" txt_f="41892">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="51885" xml_f="52213" txt_i="41893" txt_f="42221">AD and RU conceived the study.
