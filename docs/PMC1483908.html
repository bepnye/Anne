VCT was directly offered to all employees, followed by 2 y of open access to VCT and basic HIV care.

The risk ratio for on-site VCT compared to voucher uptake was 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 3.8) after adjustment for potential confounders. Only 125 employees (mean uptake by site 4.3%) reported using their voucher, so that the true adjusted risk ratio for on-site compared to off-site VCT may have been as high as 12.5 (95% confidence interval 8.2 to 16.8).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st3"><title><offsets xml_i="7935" xml_f="7946" txt_i="1501" txt_f="1512">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7957" xml_f="8274" txt_i="1513" txt_f="1830">High-impact VCT strategies are urgently needed to maximise HIV prevention and access to care in Africa.

AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is usually spread through unprotected sex with an infected partner. HIV damages the immune system, leaving infected individuals unable to fight off other viruses and bacteria. HIV infections can be treated with drugs know as “antiretrovirals,” and in an effort to deal with the global epidemic, world leaders have committed themselves to providing universal access to these drugs for everyone who needs them by 2010. Unfortunately, although access to antiretrovirals is rapidly increasing, so is the number of people infected with HIV. Last year, there were about 5 million new HIV infections, suggesting that more emphasis on prevention will be needed to halt or reverse the spread of HIV and AIDS. An important part of prevention is testing for HIV infection, but globally only 10% of people who need testing can access it. And even where such services are available, few people use them because of the stigma attached to HIV infection and fear of discrimination.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title><offsets xml_i="9646" xml_f="9670" txt_i="3085" txt_f="3109">Why Was This Study Done?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9681" xml_f="10379" txt_i="3110" txt_f="3808">There is limited understanding about the factors that determine whether an individual will decide to have an HIV test. Yet, to reduce HIV spread, as many people at risk of infection must be tested as possible. Previous studies on VCT—a combination of voluntary testing and counseling about the implications of HIV infection and how to avoid transmitting the virus—have indicated that the convenience of getting the test, whether the test is directly offered, and the attitude of staff supplying it are all very important. In this study, the researchers asked whether providing VCT in the workplace could improve the “uptake” of HIV testing in Africa, where the HIV/AIDS epidemic is most widespread.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title><offsets xml_i="10411" xml_f="10448" txt_i="3810" txt_f="3847">What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10459" xml_f="11693" txt_i="3848" txt_f="5082">The researchers identified businesses with occupational health clinics in Zimbabwe, a country where 25% of adults carry HIV, and divided them into two “intervention” groups. Employees at half the businesses were offered “on-site VCT”—pre-test counseling followed by same-day on-site rapid testing, results, and post-test counseling. Employees at the other businesses had the same pre-test counseling but were offered a voucher for an HIV test at an off-site testing center and a later appointment to discuss the results—so-called off-site VCT. Everyone had the same access to limited HIV care should they need it. Although half of the employees at the on-site VCT businesses took up the option of HIV testing, only a fifth of employees at the off-site VCT businesses accepted vouchers for testing, and only one in five of these people actually used their voucher. This means that on-site VCT resulted in about 12 times as many HIV tests as off-site VCT. In both interventions, most of the people who accepted testing did so soon after entering the study and very few people were tested more than once. Finally, people 25 years old or younger, manual workers, and single people were most likely to accept testing in both interventions.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title><offsets xml_i="11725" xml_f="11753" txt_i="5084" txt_f="5112">What Do These Findings Mean?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11764" xml_f="12810" txt_i="5113" txt_f="6159">These results suggest that on-site VCT in the workplace might be one way to improve uptake of HIV testing in Africa from its current low level and that providing VCT intermittently might be as effective as continuous provision. Importantly, say the researchers, the results of their study show that a relatively minor change in accessibility to testing can translate into a major difference in test uptake. This may hold true in non-occupational settings. However, these observations need to be repeated in more businesses and other settings, including those where there is no linked HIV care, before they can be generalized. Also, this study reports on the acceptability of this approach to providing VCT, but not on its impact on HIV prevention. As such the results do not indicate whether workplace VCT prevents HIV spread as effectively as other ways of delivering VCT. This will require research investigating how HIV incidence among HIV-negative employees and the partners of HIV-positive employees are affected by different VCT strategies.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title><offsets xml_i="12842" xml_f="12865" txt_i="6161" txt_f="6184">Additional Information.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12876" xml_f="12948" txt_i="6185" txt_f="6257">Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at

Participants at sites randomised to on-site rapid testing then had testing, results, and post-test counselling on the same day. Employees at sites randomised to the off-site strategy were given vouchers for off-site VCT and a 2-wk appointment to discuss results. The off-site VCT providers (New Start) had multiple branches in and around Harare situated at convenient locations (bus terminals and major shopping centres) that offered services after normal working hours and at weekends. After three reminders employees who had taken vouchers but reported not having used them were considered to have taken a voucher but not had VCT.

Serious adverse reactions to testing HIV-positive, which we did not observe, could be more problematic when ongoing counselling is not provided. These factors may become less critical as public sector HIV care is scaled up in Africa. Businesses were identified through an organisation providing HIV prevention, and so there may be a selection bias towards those that are unusually receptive to addressing HIV issues. Operational studies of VCT uptake in the wider business community, with and without linked HIV care provision, are needed before our results can be more broadly generalised.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37119" xml_f="37435" txt_i="24661" txt_f="24977">Individual factors associated with accepting VCT and vouchers were younger age, being single, manual work, suboptimal health, HIV status, and previous household contact with TB.

Older employees were less likely to take vouchers but more likely to accept rapid VCT at the workplace than the reference age group of 30- to 34-y-olds, indicating that accessibility may be particularly important for this age group. In multivariate analysis that included self-rated health status, being HIV-positive significantly reduced the likelihood of accepting rapid VCT at the workplace but significantly increased the likelihood of accepting a voucher. Unadjusted HIV prevalence among clients accepting rapid VCT at the workplace was not significantly different from that of more comprehensive anonymised HIV testing, however, and the on-site strategy was still the most effective among HIV-infected persons.

Further research is needed to confirm the high acceptability and to identify barriers to accepting rapid testing at the workplace. A key question will be whether VCT at the workplace, which essentially excludes couple counselling for most clients, is as effective for HIV prevention as other modes of delivering VCT. High-impact strategies aiming to “normalise” knowledge of HIV serostatus are under trial at present. Our results suggest that high accessibility will be a key requirement, and that including the workplace may contribute towards the realisation of this goal.
