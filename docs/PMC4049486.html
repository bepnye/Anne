The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients appropriately prescribed and examined (using anonymised computer records), and advised (using anonymous patient surveys) at 12 months. We will use behaviour change techniques targeting motivational, volitional, and impulsive factors that we have previously demonstrated to be predictive of multiple health professional behaviours involved in high-quality type 2 diabetes care. We will also investigate whether the intervention was delivered as designed (fidelity) by coding audiotaped workshops and interventionist delivery reports, and operated as hypothesised (process evaluation) by analysing responses to theory-based postal questionnaires. In addition, we will conduct post-trial qualitative interviews with practice teams to further inform the process evaluation, and a post-trial economic analysis to estimate the costs of the intervention and cost of service use.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8890" xml_f="8900" txt_i="2071" txt_f="2081">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8911" xml_f="9208" txt_i="2082" txt_f="2379">Consistent with UK Medical Research Council guidance and building on previous development research, this pragmatic cluster randomised trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-based complex intervention focusing on changing multiple clinical behaviours to improve quality of diabetes care.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9230" xml_f="9248" txt_i="2381" txt_f="2399">Trial registration</offsets></title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN66498413/66498413"><offsets xml_i="9359" xml_f="9373" txt_i="2400" txt_f="2414">ISRCTN66498413</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="9384" xml_f="9385" txt_i="2414" txt_f="2415">.</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9447" xml_f="9457" txt_i="2424" txt_f="2434">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9468" xml_f="9649" txt_i="2435" txt_f="2616">Type 2 diabetes is an increasingly prevalent chronic illness and an important cause of avoidable mortality.

In this respect, a random sample of 100 patients with type 2 diabetes in each practice will be surveyed. For prescribing and examining behaviours, data will be extracted from the patient computer records of all patients with type 2 diabetes in each practice. Based on our previous study an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.06 is expected and to detect a 15% absolute improvement in any of our measures of behaviour (conservatively calculated as 42.5% to 57.5%) with 80% power and 5% significance, our primary and conservative sample size estimate is that we will need 20 patients from a total of 40 practices. As this sample size does not account for any potential loss to follow-up, we will recruit a further four practices (44 in total). Accordingly, two groups of 22 practices will provide us with 83.9% power to detect a 15% improvement in any behavioural outcome. Our previous study (iQuaD) has demonstrated that this level of recruitment at the patient level is achievable, as we received postal outcome data from a mean of 41 patients per practice (having invited 100) and extracted prescribing data on all patients with type 2 diabetes in the practice (from analysing these data we identified that about 20 patients per practice were eligible for the specified prescribing behaviours). Based on our previous study we anticipate a mean sample size of 40 patients per practice and will thus have greater power. Assuming 40 practices (two groups of 20), we would have 89% power to detect a difference of 15 percentage points (42.5% versus 57.5%) assuming a type 1 error rate of 5% and an ICC of 0.06; retaining all 44 practices would increase power to 92%.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="45638" xml_f="45678" txt_i="32015" txt_f="32055">Interim analyses and stopping guidelines</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="45689" xml_f="46159" txt_i="32056" txt_f="32526">There will be no interim analysis for the primary trial outcomes.

In so doing, it will address important and relevant questions concerning the need to move beyond an isolated focus on changing one behaviour towards a more comprehensive approach that seeks to not only change multiple behaviours, but also to understand the mechanisms underpinning multiple behaviour change. To achieve this, we propose a comprehensive evaluation including not only the main trial analysis focusing on primary endpoints, but also hypothesised pathways/mechanisms of action using behaviour change techniques; intervention fidelity to allow clearer understanding of whether interventions were consistently delivered as designed and if not, why not; theory-based quantitative process evaluation investigating change in targeted hypothesised pathways; qualitative investigation of barriers and facilitators to trial participation; and a cost analysis that will inform scalability (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="62884" xml_f="62888" txt_i="48219" txt_f="48223">e.g.</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="62897" xml_f="63181" txt_i="48223" txt_f="48507"> into continuing medical education).
