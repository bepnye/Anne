Secondary outcomes include: the sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) of the decision not to refer; clinical outcomes (melanoma thickness, 5 year melanoma incidence and mortality); clinician outcomes (Index of Suspicion, confidence, learning effects); patient outcomes (satisfaction, general and cancer-specific worry), and cost-utility.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7189" xml_f="7199" txt_i="1852" txt_f="1862">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7210" xml_f="7513" txt_i="1863" txt_f="2166">The MoleMate UK Trial tests a new technology designed to improve the management of suspicious pigmented lesions in primary care.

Furthermore, although the incidence of melanoma increases with age, a third of all cases occur in people aged less than fifty years and it is the second most common cancer in the 20-39 age group. The increasing incidence has been attributed to increases in ultra-violet exposure, both natural and artificial. Other risk factors include genetic predisposition reflected in the phenotypic features of multiple moles, fair complexion, sunburn-susceptible skin types, and family history.

As such, we are considering the MoleMate system as a diagnostic tool and testing its effectiveness in the hands of primary care clinicians. There has been increasing interest in clinical decision support (CDS) aids in recent years, and they range from electronic texts, drug information and practice guideline databases to rules-based guidance systems that direct clinicians about exactly what to do for specific clinical problems. The MoleMate system is a good example of a CDS aid, with the incorporation of an algorithm specifically developed for use in primary care, with a new imaging technology already increasingly used by dermatologists. The MoleMate system has been developed to extend the utility of SIAscopy from differentiating melanoma from other pigmented lesions in the secondary care setting, to differentiating 'suspicious lesions' from 'non suspicious lesions' in the primary care setting.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35353" xml_f="35751" txt_i="26024" txt_f="26422">The trial seeks to address a common challenge for primary care health professionals- how to recognise and appropriately manage the rarely-presenting but serious conditions from commonly-presenting benign conditions.

The four-month pilot phase confirmed the proposed recruitment and referral rates and the feasibility of participant randomisation. It demonstrated the feasibility of tracking referred participants in secondary care, and established mechanisms for reference standard diagnosis for all lesions recruited into the trial. During the pilot phase semi-structured interviews and questionnaires confirmed that both participants and lead clinicians found all aspects of the trial process, including randomisation, were acceptable and did not appear to cause distress.

Preliminary data from diagnostic validation studies in the UK and Australia suggest the MoleMate system is reasonably sensitive and specific but only an RCT can determine its effect on clinical management in the UK setting. If the trial demonstrates that using the MoleMate system improves diagnostic efficiency, it will add to the range of approaches to support assessment of pigmented skin lesions in UK primary care. If the trial provides evidence of cost-utility it will inform new service models to reduce referrals to secondary care of benign lesions and improve the early diagnosis of melanoma.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39030" xml_f="39049" txt_i="29440" txt_f="29459">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39060" xml_f="39118" txt_i="29460" txt_f="29518">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39140" xml_f="39162" txt_i="29520" txt_f="29542">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39173" xml_f="39630" txt_i="29543" txt_f="30000">The writing group for the MoleMate UK Trial Protocol comprised: Fiona M Walter (FW), Jon Emery (JE), Per Hall (PH), Ann Louise Kinmonth (ALK) and Toby Prevost (ATP) (all principal investigators), with the MoleMate UK Trial team members: Helen Morris (HM, Trial Coordinator), Elka Humphrys (EH, Research Assistant), Nigel Burrows (NB) and Paul Norris (PN, consultant dermatologists); Ed Wilson (EW, trial health economist), and Margaret Johnson (lay member).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39637" xml_f="40022" txt_i="30001" txt_f="30386">FW, JE and PH conceptualised the research.
