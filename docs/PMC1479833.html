However, the drawbacks of this technique is that some samples do not aggregate with a low dose of agonist or aggregate completely when a high dose is selected. Moreover, as different fixed concentrations are used, it is not possible to compare the results between centres. A solution is to report EC50s, the concentrations of agonist that produce 50% aggregation. In this way, it is possible to avoid the arbitrary selection of a fixed dose of agonist and also to allow results from different studies to be compared.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17512" xml_f="17522" txt_i="11997" txt_f="12007">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17533" xml_f="17919" txt_i="12008" txt_f="12394">Low dose aspirin is effective and medium dose aspirin did not prove superior as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation in vitro after coronary surgery.
