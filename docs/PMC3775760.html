Twenty-three patients with virus suppressed by antiretroviral therapy were enrolled in four groups 12 mg (n = 6), 24 mg (n = 6), 48 mg (n = 2) or matching placebo (n = 8). Treatment was administered intravenously after bedside enrichment of 120 mL whole blood for white cells using a closed system (Sepax S-100 device), with ex vivo peptide admixture (or diluent alone) and 37°C incubation for one hour prior to reinfusion. Patients received 4 administrations at monthly intervals followed by a 12-week observation post-treatment. Opal-HIV-Gag(c) was reasonably tolerated at doses of 12 and 24 mg. There was an increased incidence of temporally associated pyrexia, chills, and transient/self-limiting lymphopenia in Opal-HIV-Gag(c) recipients compared to placebo. The study was terminated early, after two patients were recruited to the 48 mg cohort; a serious adverse event of hypotension, tachycardia secondary to diarrhoea occurred following a single product administration. An infectious cause for the event could not be identified, leaving the possibility of immunologically mediated product reaction.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9649" xml_f="9660" txt_i="1899" txt_f="1910">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9671" xml_f="9953" txt_i="1911" txt_f="2193">A serious, potentially life-threatening event of hypotension led to early, precautionary termination of the study.

The use of combination highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly improved prospects for HIV infected individuals and has lowered transmission rates. However, the treatment regimens are complex, expensive and may be associated with treatment-limiting side effects and the emergence of drug resistant viral strains. These factors remain critical barriers to the management of HIV/AIDS, particularly in economically disadvantaged communities. The availability of an immunotherapy, which either delays the introduction of HAART or complements treatment by HAART, would be an important advance in treating HIV.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11521" xml_f="11657" txt_i="3165" txt_f="3301">The induction of HIV-specific T-cell responses is critical to effective control of viraemia and delaying subsequent progression to AIDS </offsets><xref rid="pone.0073765-Goulder1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="11707" xml_f="11710" txt_i="3301" txt_f="3304">[2]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11717" xml_f="11718" txt_i="3304" txt_f="3305">–</offsets><xref rid="pone.0073765-Barouch1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="11768" xml_f="11771" txt_i="3305" txt_f="3308">[4]</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11778" xml_f="11901" txt_i="3308" txt_f="3431">.

Within 2 hours of completion of the first infusion, he began to experience cramping, abdominal discomfort and subsequently passed large volume, watery bowel motions on 3 occasions within the ensuing hour, with simultaneous vomiting on two occasions.

A GLP, repeat dose, non-human primate (Macaca mulatta) toxicology study was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunotoxicity of Opal HIV Gag(c). Eighteen animals were randomly allocated to receive 1.85 or 18.5 milligram (mg) of cGMP Opal HIV Gag(c) in DMSO or DMSO only (n = 6 per group). Treatment was added to whole blood ex vivo, incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees (°) Celsius (C), and reinfused on 5 separate occasions.

In determining the adequacy of the clinical dose for immunogenicity purposes, both the amount of Opal HIV Gag(c) and the number of PBMCs exposed have been taken into account. Allometric scaling on body surface area (BSA) was performed to determine the blood volume required in the clinic to yield a proportionally similar number of PBMCs to that shown to be effective in macaques. The blood volume ranged from 29.5 mL to 120 mL, and thus 120 mL of venous blood was drawn from each patient. From the non-human primate non-clinical studies, it was estimated that 9×106 to 1.8×107 PBMCs were exposed to peptides at each administration for each macaque. Allometrically scaling this to humans (based on BSA) yielded an ideal PBMC count of 5.9×107 to 1.2×108 for Opal treatment per person, the range achieved in the clinical trial. Finally, a range of 0.035 mg to 0.07 mg of peptide per million PBMCs was shown to be efficacious in the non-human primate model. Extrapolating this to humans with the expected PBMC yield from 120 mL of whole blood requires a range of minimum doses of 4.2 to 16.8 mg per administration. The clinical doses evaluated span this range with the minimum dose of 12 mg and the maximum dose of 48 mg.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36316" xml_f="36891" txt_i="24858" txt_f="25433">In conclusion, in this double blind, placebo controlled, dose escalation study, Opal-HIV-Gag(c)) was generally well tolerated in adults with well-controlled HIV-1 infection at doses of 12 and 24 mg.
