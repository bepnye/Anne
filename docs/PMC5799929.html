In the present study, endometrial thickness was recorded on USG during ovulation evaluation posttherapy. The mean endometrial thickness was between 7 and 9 mm in either group of patients who ovulated. Pregnancies were also noted at an endometrium thickness of 7–9 mm at 100 mg dose.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16443" xml_f="16489" txt_i="11131" txt_f="11177">In a retrospective study by Budinetz in 2015,[</offsets><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="16522" xml_f="16523" txt_i="11177" txt_f="11178">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16530" xml_f="17131" txt_i="11178" txt_f="11779">] ovulation rate and cycle characteristics were studied in patients who had previously been ovulatory after a stair-step ovulation induction. He summarized that women ovulating with stair-step regimen will again ovulate after taking the previously ovulatory CC dose in a subsequent cycle. Those who do not ovulate are likely to ovulate with a further increase in CC dose. Many patients desire a more active and aggressive management and get very distressed by having to await menses or have their menses induced. They are at higher risk for depressive illnesses, anxiety symptoms, and social phobias.[</offsets><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="17165" xml_f="17167" txt_i="11779" txt_f="11781">10</offsets></xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="17208" xml_f="17210" txt_i="11781" txt_f="11783">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17217" xml_f="17392" txt_i="11783" txt_f="11958">] For many patients, the SSP might be a good option, since women are more likely to drop out of therapy if they are anovulatory with treatment as their frustration increases.[</offsets><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="17426" xml_f="17428" txt_i="11958" txt_f="11960">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17435" xml_f="17436" txt_i="11960" txt_f="11961">]</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title><offsets xml_i="17493" xml_f="17494" txt_i="11963" txt_f="11964">C</offsets><sc><offsets xml_i="17498" xml_f="17508" txt_i="11964" txt_f="11974">ONCLUSIONS</offsets></sc></title><p><offsets xml_i="17524" xml_f="17918" txt_i="11975" txt_f="12369">The results from this study reflected the effectiveness of clomiphene when being used as stair-step regimen.
