Over the recent years all over the world, including in Iran, caesarean has become an increasingly popular process.

Generally, the medical-intervention abuse in the process of natural delivery leads to caesarean statistical increase and, consequently, to the increase of its side effect. During the last 30 years, caesarean has not improved the results of pregnancy and delivery. The purpose of caesarean was primarily to save the mother’s life in the case of problematic deliveries. Its use, however, has increased during years (</offsets><xref rid="b8-epj-08-3177" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7902" xml_f="7903" txt_i="2948" txt_f="2949">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7910" xml_f="8167" txt_i="2949" txt_f="3206">).

Nowadays, in most advanced countries of the world, adapting new policies about mother and infant’s health and doing interventions, attempts have been made to reduce the caesarean rate. The high statistics and figures of caesarean in the country and our distance from the World Health Organization (doing caesarean to the extent of 15% until 2010) have made researchers and authorities of women public health so worried that, in Iran and other countries simultaneously, a lot of attempts have been in regards to physiological delivery classes during pregnancy and physiological delivery.

Hence, delivery-preparation counseling meetings have been suggested to primarily be held comprehensively in all clinics and hospitals to teach the performance of physiological delivery to all midwives and pregnant mothers, which will be an effective step toward the improvement of the delivery process in the country via elevating the medical staffs’ knowledge, believing in the suitability of the method, and creating the spirit of self-believing in pregnant mothers to deliver naturally (</offsets><xref rid="b15-epj-08-3177" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10452" xml_f="10454" txt_i="5142" txt_f="5144">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10461" xml_f="11858" txt_i="5144" txt_f="6541">). Care during pregnancy and delivery-preparation consultation, which are an important duty in midwifery, may be effective in increasing a pregnant woman’s knowledge. Midwives may provide the pregnant women with valuable pieces of information during their pregnancy through consultation. Because the educational scope of delivery-preparation classes, including nutrition and physical activities, affect the pregnancy consequences, we may correct incorrect health behaviors, improve the pregnancy consequences, and change the pregnancy period and delivery to a pleasant memory through midwifery education and consultation based on GATHER principles (establishing relationship, interaction, presenting useful and suitable pieces of information, explaining various pregnancy and delivery issues, following the mothers up in counseling and educational meetings). Because providing pregnant women with education and consultation before, during, and after delivery is considered as the crucial duty of the midwives, the educational and counseling role of the midwives is important and undeniable and can affect the performance of the pregnant woman. Therefore, this study has dealt with the effect of consultation and education in the classes for delivery preparation on the delivery consequences, including the selection of the type of delivery, the type of delivery performed, and the infant’s weight.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11880" xml_f="11903" txt_i="6543" txt_f="6566">2.

The researcher-made demographic questionnaire consisted of 26 items in regards to demographic and midwifery information of participants during their previous and current pregnancy. Ten faculty member validated the questionnaire. The validity of the weighing balance also was confirmed by its manufacturer and standard trade mark. To be exact in every measurement, a standard weight was used, and the balance was calibrated at the beginning and after 10 times of weighing. Before any educational meeting, some items of the demographic questionnaire were administered to the groups as a pretest in the form of interviewing. Then, the intervention group was exposed to eight sessions of delivery preparation. The educational program or syllabus covered anatomy and physiology of the patient’s genital organs, personal health, nutrition, warning signs, and mental health during and after pregnancy and delivery. It also included the explanation of advantages and disadvantages of types of delivery and painlessness, issues related to after delivery, infant and breast feeding, teaching breathing exercises, massage, and exercises during pregnancy via face-to-face group teaching, educational CD, practical teaching of exercises, and booklets. In each class, mostly 10 mothers took part. The educational materials were taught theoretically and practically to the mothers in 90 minutes by a well-educated midwife, who holds a certificate in physiological delivery performance based on the principles of GATHER consultation. The control group received only the pregnancy routine care. Finally, the questionnaire was administered to the two groups at the end of 37 weeks of pregnancy.

The results of this study showed that about 80% of the participants preferred natural delivery after receiving education; finally, 57.6% of them experienced natural delivery. Although only 1.2% of the participants under study had chosen caesarean, the follow-up, after delivery, revealed that 30% of patients in the intervention group had tolerated emergency caesarean. Thus, it can be stated that the high number of caesarean in the country is due to the factors, other than the mother’s choice, such as unnecessary interventions in the process of delivery. The result of this study is similar to that of Arefi et al.

The authors showed that receiving education could reduce the rate of caesarean in the intervention group significantly. Fear of delivery is one of the factors that leads to caesarean. This is verified by the study conducted by Storksen et al.

The results of their study showed that 80% of their participants were afraid of delivery, and, although this fear was related to elective caesarean and caesarean section, the majority of their participants did not go under caesarean operation. The main predictive variables were actually elective caesarean, risky medical factors, and negative experience of the previous delivery. However, via modern methods of delivery such as nonmedical and supporting treatments, which are taught in the meetings of consultation for delivery preparation, we can change delivery into a pleasant and enjoyable occurrence for the mother through the improvement of psychological and emotional aspects of delivery, and, through reducing the severity of pain and fear, we may decrease elective caesarean (</offsets><xref rid="b15-epj-08-3177" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="21781" xml_f="21783" txt_i="15661" txt_f="15663">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21790" xml_f="22075" txt_i="15663" txt_f="15948">). Another finding of the present study was the higher weight of the infants whose mother were in the intervention group.

This had threatened the validity of the data. One of the strengths of this study, however, was randomization. That is, after receiving the mothers’ conscious consent to take part in the study, they were randomly assigned to groups. This study had its own limitations. It was rather longitudinal and time consuming (from the 20th week of pregnancy to after the delivery), which made it difficult to access the participants. The research project required many sessions of teaching. Because the mothers were not on time as far as their participation in the teaching classes was concerned, the researcher had to hold makeup classes for 10 mothers.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24933" xml_f="24947" txt_i="18174" txt_f="18188">5.

Hence, more classes for delivery preparation are suggested to be held in pregnancy care centers in order to adapt the mothers to different steps of delivery in a better way, decrease mothers’ tendency toward elective caesarean, and, finally, encourage the other pregnant mothers to prefer natural and/or physiological delivery.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the research deputy of the Hamedan University of Medical Sciences.
