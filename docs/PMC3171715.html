Otherwise, the afflicted risk lifelong impairment or death. In rural areas of Africa and Asia, appropriate care is often miles away. In 2009, Melba Gomes and her colleagues published the findings of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of rectal artesunate for suspected severe malaria in such remote areas. Enrolling nearly 18,000 cases, the aim was to evaluate whether, as patients were in transit to a health facility, a pre-referral artesunate suppository blocked disease progression sufficiently to reduce these risks. The affirmative findings of this, the only trial on the issue thus far, have led the WHO to endorse rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria. In the light of its public health importance and because its scientific quality has not been assessed for a systematic review, our paper provides a detailed evaluation of the design, conduct, analysis, reporting, and practical features of this trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="3970" xml_f="3977" txt_i="1030" txt_f="1037">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3988" xml_f="5335" txt_i="1038" txt_f="2385">We performed a checklist-based and an in-depth evaluation of the trial. The evaluation criteria were based on the CONSORT statement for reporting clinical trials, the clinical trial methodology literature, and practice in malaria research. Our main findings are: The inclusion and exclusion criteria and the sample size justification are not stated. Many clearly ineligible subjects were enrolled. The training of the recruiters does not appear to have been satisfactory. There was excessive between center heterogeneity in design and conduct. Outcome evaluation schedule was not defined, and in practice, became too wide. Large gaps in the collection of key data were evident. Primary endpoints were inconsistently utilized and reported; an overall analysis of the outcomes was not done; analyses of time to event data had major flaws; the stated intent-to-treat analysis excluded a third of the randomized subjects; the design-indicated stratified or multi-variate analysis was not done; many improper subgroups were analyzed in a post-hoc fashion; the analysis and reporting metric was deficient. There are concerns relating to patient welfare at some centers. Exclusion of many cases from data analysis compromised external validity. A bias-controlled reanalysis of available data does not lend support to the conclusions drawn by the authors.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5357" xml_f="5368" txt_i="2387" txt_f="2398">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5379" xml_f="5769" txt_i="2399" txt_f="2789">This trial has numerous serious deficiencies in design, implementation, and methods of data analysis.

They may not be able to take oral medication, and face a high risk of permanent disability or death. Can that risk be reduced by an artesunate suppository placed as the patient embarks on the possibly long journey to a clinic? By rapidly lowering parasitemia, rectal artesunate may impede progression of the disease sufficiently to decrease the chance of a grave adverse outcome occasioned by the delay in securing appropriate treatment.

The cases in the latter had free hospital and supportive care. In Africa nothing like that was arranged. At the referral clinic in Bangladesh, intravenous quinine was given. In Africa, intramuscular injections were given. There were about two recruiters per village, on average, in Africa; in Bangladesh, there was exactly one recruiter per village. The calibre of the recruiters, and the training schemes perhaps differed. One blood slide per case was taken in Africa but two were taken in Bangladesh. The types of data collected varied somewhat. The African centers themselves had differences in design. We give more details later. These differences put this trial in the grey-zone between a well designed multi-center trial, and a collection of two, three or four distinct trials with their own protocols.

In a follow-up design, computing a proportion assumes a fixed time window. Data analysis for an uncomplicated malaria trial, for example, usually evaluates a 14-day or 28-day treatment failure rate. Minor variation in follow-up times, as in a window of 13-15 days for the 14-day rate, is inevitable and acceptable. But if, as judged by the nature of the disease, times to follow-up vary extensively, the appropriate course of action is to analyze the data as time to event data.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44919" xml_f="45547" txt_i="35282" txt_f="35910">Accordingly, Figure two of Gomes et al. shows the cumulative death rate, and the cumulative D or PD rate over time (by continent and treatment). The method used for estimating the curves is not stated. Their first portions (up to 7 days) treat the data appropriately as time to event data. But in the second portions, the time window is compressed, and simple proportions are given. By presenting these as survival curves but not exactly declaring them to be as such reduces clarity. A reader may take all the proportions as cumulative proportions, and the last ones can be misinterpreted as the 30 day death (or D or PD) rates.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45554" xml_f="46394" txt_i="35911" txt_f="36751">Take the outcome death. Three data items were available for each case: the day of the first follow-up visit, the status of the patient on that day (dead or alive), and if dead, the day of death. For those who died before day 7, either that fact became known at the time, or at a subsequent follow-up visit. Since, except for the very few cases with suspected PD, no further follow-up occurred, the data are censored data that are usually analyzed with survival data methods, or as person-day data. Even if the main analyses were done in terms of simple proportions, the authors could have shown the appropriate cumulative proportions to day 30 in Figure two with the Kaplan-Meier method. Appreciable variations in the follow-up times generally, by treatment arm or by center can produce different results from different methods of analysis.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46401" xml_f="47493" txt_i="36752" txt_f="37844">Take a simple example: Suppose there were four cases in each group, and the planned follow up was at 30 days after entry. But, poor implementation caused it to be done on an ad hoc basis. The respective days to death data for the artesunate and placebo groups were: {8+, 9+, 27, 28} and {8, 9, 27+, 28+}. Here, '+' represents a censored observation. Under the planned binary outcome analysis of the 30 day survival rate, follow-up at 27 or 28 days may be deemed close enough and acceptable. But the censored status of the first two cases in the artesunate group is so far from the target day that their final outcome would have to be regarded as unknown, and their data treated as missing. To use these early censored data, a survival analysis is needed. Instead, Gomes et al. went ahead with the proportions-based analysis but now under an expanded time window of 7-30 days. This not only mixes up short term and medium term mortality but also makes the loss to follow-up rate appear lower than it really was. In this example, the wide window makes the missing data rate drop from 25% to 0%.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47500" xml_f="47827" txt_i="37845" txt_f="38172">The wide window can also produce misleading results.

Nonetheless, removing a third of the randomized cases from all the analyses is a major violation of the ITT principle.

Gomes et al. do not report the NNT for the main outcomes but raise the issue in the discussion section. They state that they did not compute the NNT because baseline risks vary. As we noted earlier, the main data analyses of Gomes et al. were not stratified by center. Varied baseline risks were thereby not taken into account, and instead of weighted risk ratios, simple overall risk ratios were given.

The design flaws were manifested in the absence of well specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcome variables that were pre-specified, sample size computation, concrete time window for follow-up, and clear information on recruiters and training. Between center variability in number of blood slides, age of subjects enrolled, provision of transport and good care lacked a clear rationale. Shortfalls in implementation were evident through enrollment of clearly ineligible subjects and high missing levels for key data. The time window in the analysis mixed up short term and medium term mortality, and the survival analysis was not done. Excluding a third of the randomized cases from analysis not only violated the ITT principle but also compromised external validity, particularly since the exclusions stemmed from a contextually inappropriate factor. While the needed overall stratified analysis was not done, an excessive number of post-hoc subgroup analyses, many based on a post-randomization event, were done. An unbiased reanalysis of available trial data did not support the conclusions of the paper. The manner of reporting also left a lot to be desired. Essential information is publicly unavailable. Some information is internally contradictory. The contextual interventions, or lack thereof, did not protect patient welfare as it ought to have been protected, and because there was no clear rationale for their variability, compromised the applicability of the findings of the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="95015" xml_f="95429" txt_i="77504" txt_f="77918">Some of the problems we identified had a greater impact on the trial's scientific validity than others.
