If infection occurs less than 48 hours after hospitalization, it is likely that the patient was in the incubation stage of the disease during hospital admission. Worldwide, one in four patients hospitalized in ICU are infected and it is estimated that the rate is double in developing countries. Hospital infections are important from several aspects including cause of mortality and illness, increase in the duration of hospitalization, increased costs due to prolonged hospitalization, and diagnostic and treatment procedures of transmission of microorganisms in hospitals.

However, the antibacterial activity of garlic is widely attributed to allicin. Allicin is made up of freshly crushed garlic homogenates. The antimicrobial effect of allicin is mainly related to its chemical reaction with thiol groups of various enzymes influencing the essential metabolism of cysteine proteinase activity involved in the virulence of E. histolytic (</offsets><xref rid="b24-epj-09-4064" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="12148" xml_f="12150" txt_i="6488" txt_f="6490">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12157" xml_f="12649" txt_i="6490" txt_f="6982">).

None of the variables were shown to be significant. During the study, 78 samples of venous catheter tip culture were sent to the laboratory, of which 37 cases related to the intervention group and 41 cases related to the control group (as the culture result of other samples were contaminated, only venous catheter tip cultures of 78 samples were tested). The culture result of venous catheter tip was positive for 5 cases, of which, all were related to the control group and no cases of positive culture result was observed in the intervention group. It also showed that the frequency distribution of catheter tip culture was significantly higher in the control group (p=0.03). During the study period, urine tests were taken from 36 patients in the intervention group and from 32 patients in the control group. The mean of urine white blood cells in the intervention and control groups were 4.41±4.04 and 4.48±4.1, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the two groups (p=0.48). During the study, a culture test was taken from 35 patients in the intervention group and 30 patients from the control group. The culture result was positive for two patients in the intervention group and six patients in the control groups. With regard to the positivity of the culture result, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (p=0.13). One patient in the intervention group died during the study period (cause of death was reported to be due to trauma within a few days of ICU admission, not related to the intervention), but no death occurred in the control group (2.3% vs. 0%) and there was no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.99) (</offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-epj-09-4064"><offsets xml_i="23511" xml_f="23518" txt_i="16989" txt_f="16996">Table 4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23525" xml_f="23527" txt_i="16996" txt_f="16998">).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23549" xml_f="23562" txt_i="17000" txt_f="17013">4.

In this study, two groups of 47 patients admitted to the ICU were studied for six days. Based on the results of our study, no significant difference was observed between the intervention and control groups during the 6 days of study period with regard to inflammatory factors, the level of white blood cells, blood sugar levels and red and white blood SOFA index. Therefore, it can be concluded that taking garlic tablets had no significant effect on the aforementioned parameters, but based on the result obtained, the mean of body temperature that is an indicator of infection occurrence had a significant difference between the two groups during the study, and the patients receiving garlic tablet had lower body temperature. Moreover, there were no cases of venous catheter infection in the group receiving garlic tablet while 12.2% of patients in the control group suffered from venous catheter infection. Cases of urinary infection were significantly higher in the control group but the difference was not statistically significant. In a study by Tsao et al. in 2001, in vitro antibacterial activities of garlic oil and four diallyl sulphides naturally occurring in this oil were studied against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia, and it was found that garlic oil, through synergic or additive effects, could be potentially used to prevent or treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria-caused nosocomial infections (</offsets><xref rid="b26-epj-09-4064" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="25242" xml_f="25244" txt_i="18639" txt_f="18641">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25251" xml_f="25760" txt_i="18641" txt_f="19150">). In a study by Dikasso et al, antibacterial effect of garlic prepared by agar technique was examined against some causes of pneumonia and it was confirmed that streptococcus pneumonia was completely removed through 8.7 mgr/ml of this solution, and clinical samples of Klebsiella pneumonia were inhibited by 38.24 mgr/ml of this solution.

In a research by Dankert et al, the inhibitory effect of garlic, onion and shallot extracts was examined by agar diffusion test on the growth of a number of bacteria and yeasts, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

In a study by Josling and his colleagues, 146 individuals were randomly selected into two groups receiving placebo and garlic allicin. Both groups were evaluated at 12 weeks and it was observed that the volunteers in the active group not only had less number of colds but also recovered quickly in the event of infection.

In a study by Elnima, comparing the effects of garlic (Allhumsativum) and onion (Allium cepa) extracts on the number of positive and Gram-negative fungus, it was shown that garlic extract has more bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities than onion extract. Furthermore, the effect of garlic extract on normal flora of the mouth of volunteers were investigated.

In another study, inhibitory effects of extracts of garlic and onions on the isolated bacteria, including four Gram-negative bacteria, were studied and the results showed that extracts of garlic and onion can compete with Gram-positive bacteria and with only one Gram-negative isolated bacteria (Klebsiella pneumonia). Inhibitory effects of allicin on nine different species of fungi such as Microsporum, Canis M. gypseum, and Trichophyton simii were also observed while growing mushrooms such as Chrysosporium, Trichophyton Mentagrophytes PPM Queenslandicum were inhibited by the extract (</offsets><xref rid="b30-epj-09-4064" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="27923" xml_f="27925" txt_i="21065" txt_f="21067">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27932" xml_f="28282" txt_i="21067" txt_f="21417">).

Similar to all herbal-based medicine, garlic extract was used in traditional medicine in vivo to kill bacteria, fungi and viruses.

Many beneficial effects following the use of garlic diet on patients with a weakened immune system were achieved. Fibrinolytic activity of garlic was shown in platelet aggregation and it was confirmed that, what has traditionally been used for such treatments, still has useful effects on treatment of many diseases (</offsets><xref rid="b34-epj-09-4064" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="29388" xml_f="29390" txt_i="22275" txt_f="22277">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="29397" xml_f="29807" txt_i="22277" txt_f="22687">). It was stated that the effects of garlic on different microorganisms were different from each other, so that even though the same method was used, the effect of extract on different bacteria will not be identical. For example, in the study by Arora et al in 1999, Staphylococcus epidermidis bacterium was killed during one hour, but Salmonella typhi was killed within 3 hours of exposure to garlic extract (</offsets><xref rid="b35-epj-09-4064" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="29851" xml_f="29853" txt_i="22687" txt_f="22689">35</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="29860" xml_f="30296" txt_i="22689" txt_f="23125">). Many studies have shown that a garlic compound enhances the phagocytic effect of immune cells (36). So, reinforcing effect of garlic and allicin is more evident because they strengthen phagocytic activity of macrophages and secrete factors. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the garlic tablet is an acceptable compound in inhibition of bacteria growth, especially isolated pathogens of hospital infections.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="30318" xml_f="30357" txt_i="23127" txt_f="23166">5.
