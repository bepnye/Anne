By comparison, the larger-eccentricity pedestrians were less likely to be detected by habitual scanning (needed about a 14° scan) but were within the field expansion area of the prisms, and thus detection rates improved to a greater extent.

It could be questioned whether improved detection was simply due to repetition of the driving simulator pedestrian-detection task (an order or learning effect), rather than effects of the prisms and training. However, in a prior study, participants with HH driving without p-prisms showed no significant improvements in blind-side pedestrian-detection rates or response times between two driving simulator sessions, 1 week apart.</offsets><sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-7-1-5-b01" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="49571" xml_f="49572" txt_i="38274" txt_f="38275">1</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="49585" xml_f="50383" txt_i="38275" txt_f="39073"> In the current study, the minimum time between driving simulator visits was 2 weeks; therefore, it seems reasonable that the effects we measured represent treatment effects rather than learning or order effects. The lack of correlation between patients' subjective safety rating data and their detection rates provides additional support to this conclusion, suggesting patients were effectively masked to their actual performance and so had no stimulus to learn to improve. It is interesting that despite priming via the seeing side (there were the same number of pedestrians on blind and seeing sides), patients did not recognize they experienced fewer pedestrians on their blind side, representing the detection failures. Inability to properly self-assess in HH represents a public safety issue.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="50390" xml_f="50749" txt_i="39074" txt_f="39433">Since the simulator sessions were 3 hours in duration, fatigue may have affected performance in the later portions of each session; however, this effect would be expected in each of the sessions and therefore would not influence the between-session comparisons.

Perceptual-motor training appears to further improve detection and timely responses, but maintenance training may be required to retain the benefits. It is also important to emphasize that while p-prisms appear to have improved performance, there continued to be impairment on the blind side relative to the seeing side. Furthermore, there was wide between-subject variability in performance both without and with p-prisms, supporting the need for individualized assessment. Still, p-prisms appear to improve safety by reducing the risk of untimely detections, and although use of p-prisms for driving cannot be endorsed as a complete resolution of impairment, the results of this pilot study are very encouraging and justify the next step—a randomized, sham-controlled trial with a larger sample size, possibly with specific training to increase detection.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="51960" xml_f="51982" txt_i="40584" txt_f="40606">Supplementary Material</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="tvst-06-06-11_s01"><label><offsets xml_i="52070" xml_f="52082" txt_i="40607" txt_f="40619">Supplement 1</offsets></label><media xlink:href="tvst-06-06-11_s01.pdf"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="52144" xml_f="52180" txt_i="40619" txt_f="40655">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Jean Paul Wiegand, Jeffrey Churchill, Lauren Spano, and Rui Liu for help with data collection and processing and Doris Apfelbaum and Amy Doherty for study coordination.</p><p>Supported in part by Department of Defense Grant DM090420 (EP, ARB), K12EY016335 (KEH), R01-EY025677 (ARB), R01-EY023385 (EP), and S10RR028122.</p><p>Disclosure: <bold>K.E.
