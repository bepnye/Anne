In recurrent cases, we tended to identify the medial rectus prior to lesion excision. We paid particular attention to the excision of the underlying and surrounding Tenon's capsule. Minimal cauterization was applied to bleeding vessels. The next step was to prepare the conjunctival autograft with the following method: The bare sclera (conjunctival defect) was measured, and then a free conjunctival graft was harvested from the superonasal bulbar conjunctiva. When harvesting the conjunctival graft, we aimed for a thin conjunctival layer with as little Tenon's tissue as possible, and for a graft that included a narrow edge of limbal corneal cells. The free graft was transposed, keeping it in the same orientation in relation to the cornea. The conjunctival defect where the graft was harvested from was left without suturing. At this stage, the conjunctival autograft was either sutured or glued. For suturing the graft, 8/0 vicryl sutures were used (PGA FSSB-Chirurgische Nadeln GMBH-Germany), so that four corners of the graft were anchored to the episclera with single sutures in addition to one continuous conjunctival-conjunctival suture, and knots were buried whenever possible. In cases of autologous fibrin glue, the graft was placed with the epithelium side down on the cornea, one drop of the thrombin component (800 NIH-U/ml) was placed on the scleral bed, and one drop of the fibrinogen solution was placed on the graft, and the graft was quickly flipped over the sclera and smoothed out while the fibrinogen was activated by the thrombin forming the fibrin glue. After positioning the graft, we allowed about 30 s to smooth out the graft and depressed it gently to the scleral bed, to attach it firmly but not stiffly. Excess glue was removed, and the graft was trimmed if necessary. Patients were discharged on the same day with the double eye patch for 24 h.

Autologous cryoprecipitate may be superior to commercial products since it probably reduces the risk of transfusion transmitted diseases. It has two modes of action: Sealing the wound and acting as a hemostatic agent. The rationale of using fibrin glue is to maximize post-operative patient comfort, to reduce suture related complications and less importantly to shorten the surgical time. In our case series, problems associated with suture closures of wounds (e.g., cysts, granulomas, button hole, and milia) were not seen. We did not notice any obvious transplant edema that was described in the other studies in either group.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10"><offsets xml_i="18087" xml_f="18089" txt_i="13319" txt_f="13321">10</offsets></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21"><offsets xml_i="18130" xml_f="18132" txt_i="13321" txt_f="13323">21</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="18146" xml_f="18424" txt_i="13324" txt_f="13602">VAS is commonly used to analyze and quantify the severity of pain.

As expected, surgical time was shorter in the glue group, almost half the time required to perform pterygium excision with sutured conjunctival autograft, and this was reflected on the amount of post-operative inflammation and pain.

Although in theory, this may increase the risk of a patient inadvertently receiving someone else's plasma, a strict protocol was used to avoid this problem. If we add to that the shorter surgical time, then it will be cost-effective to use natural tissue glue rather than suturing conjunctival grafts. Finally, this study meets the published report's recommendations that research should be dedicated to making fibrin glue available and affordable to more patients, and answers some of the concerns regarding the possibility of transmitting infectious agents through commercially available fibrin glue.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23"><offsets xml_i="21424" xml_f="21426" txt_i="16366" txt_f="16368">23</offsets></xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title><offsets xml_i="21490" xml_f="21501" txt_i="16370" txt_f="16381">CONCLUSIONS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21512" xml_f="21953" txt_i="16382" txt_f="16823">The use of autologous cryoprecipitate to attach the free conjunctival autograft in pterygium surgery appeared to be safe, reliable, quick, and repeatable with one of the lowest recurrence rates for both primary and recurrent pterygium surgeries.

Moreover, there were no cases of recurrence during the follow-up period.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Walid Faisal, MD, MSc (Department
