A large difference in the intervention effect at the level of school nurses and/or schools is expected to decrease the precision of the trial comparison. However, clustering of children within schools is expected to increase the precision of the intervention effect. It is not possible to estimate the magnitude of these effects a priori, so these have not been included in the sample size calculation.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s2p"><title><offsets xml_i="42382" xml_f="42402" txt_i="29739" txt_f="29759">Statistical analyses</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42413" xml_f="42513" txt_i="29760" txt_f="29860">All analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle at 6 and 12 months postrandomisation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42520" xml_f="43183" txt_i="29861" txt_f="30524">For aim 1, for continuous standard scores (our primary outcome of child psychosocial functioning at 6 months and most secondary outcomes), we will use linear regression models to estimate the mean difference (and 95% CIs) between the intervention and control groups.

A successful transition to school is formative to these outcomes. A child's ability to adapt to school is shaped not only by early life experiences, but also by current health and well-being. Thus, any modifiable problems that prevent an optimal school transition should be addressed systematically and urgently.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44866" xml_f="45501" txt_i="32007" txt_f="32642">Sleep problems are one such issue. Research has already shown that at school entry, sleep problems are common and have serious immediate impacts on how children function. Research has also shown that these sleep problems are treatable, and that treatment improves psychosocial functioning as well as sleep. The next step is to confirm these findings in a definitive cost-effectiveness trial. This effectiveness RCT continues along the translation continuum by trialling the sleep intervention in ‘real-world’ settings, that is, delivered by primary school nurses through the existing school health screening and intervention framework.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45508" xml_f="45561" txt_i="32643" txt_f="32696">If cost-effective, we expect the following outcomes:
