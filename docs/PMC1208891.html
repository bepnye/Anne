To test this, one investigator, on a randomly selected day of the week, called all members of the team (n = 8 i.e. excluding the consultant) and measured the time taken for doctors to respond to the call. If after 5 minutes, there was no reply, it was noted that the doctor had 'failed to respond'. We used this measurement of 'response time' to measure efficiency of communication with the respective devices. The mobile phones were called directly and the paging was done via the standard paging system of using the hospital extension. In order to minimise the risk of bias we ensured that doctors could not differentiate a test call from regular communication traffic by making calls from different hospital extensions on each occasion. For the purpose of computing mean response time for each period of the study, the failure to respond was given a value of 301 seconds (5minutes + 1 second). Undoubtedly, not all members of the team would be in the same place; some were in the operating theatre, some on the wards and some in clinic. Whether this affected the response times is beyond the scope of this pilot-study. The aim was however to determine the response times at a randomly allocated point in time as in a real-life situation. We determined the rate ratios of those failing to respond for each pair of adjacent Pager/PDA periods and pooled the results using a fixed effects model to produce an overall rate ratio for failure to respond.

technology might reduce the time doctors take to respond to a call. This is not surprising as the PDA with a mobile phone is a bi-directional device and enables faster communication between the caller and the doctor. Furthermore, it highlights an important potential limitation of pagers. Doctors often find themselves on busy hospital wards where phones are often otherwise engaged, or lifts, corridors, and just outside the hospital, where the absence of a landline makes the pager an ineffective communication device. Although the study lasted only six weeks, there is no evidence to suggest that these devices will not be as effective in the longer term. In addition, it is important to note that the members of the study group were not all 'PDA enthusiasts', but a rather diverse group consisting of pro-PDA users as well as sceptics even though it is often felt that resident physicians or surgeons are more likely to use newer technology and are more receptive to change. The group on the whole was largely heterogeneous in this respect. Only 2/9 (22%) participants in the study had prior experience with a PDA (1 using a Palm device and 1 using a Pocket PC device).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21568" xml_f="22053" txt_i="15588" txt_f="16073">The assessment of doctors' perceptions regarding introduction of PDAs during the six-week study demonstrated an increasing level of confidence with the devices. This is an important characteristic that any device proposed to replace the hospital pager must have. Widespread mobile phone and PDA use in the commercial setting have meant that the majority of doctors working in the UK already own such technology and are therefore likely to be comfortable with using the devices at work.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22060" xml_f="22770" txt_i="16074" txt_f="16784">The ability to store electronic versions of commonly used reference material such as the British National Formulary and the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine on a single chip is a potentially valuable attribute of the PDA. It means that clinicians can now carry on their person a quantity of reference material that would previously have been inconceivable in hard-copy format. This is, we believe, particularly important for junior doctors and during night-time periods when there are fewer people around to ask for advice. With regards to standard of patient care, it is conceivable that these reference materials may aid correct diagnosis and management, particularly with regards to correct drug dosage.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22777" xml_f="22971" txt_i="16785" txt_f="16979">A major limitation of most research involving mobile phone devices in healthcare is that this has been carried out under laboratory conditions, as opposed to a field test such as in this study [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><offsets xml_i="23003" xml_f="23005" txt_i="16979" txt_f="16981">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23012" xml_f="23510" txt_i="16981" txt_f="17479">]. Research on the use of PDAs however, has been in the form of field tests, and supports the finding of this study. An example of this is a recent trial in the United Kingdom, where authors looked at the use of PDAs to access reference information as well as local and national guidelines by members of an on call service for health protection, with results suggesting that this was a fast, reliable and easily maintained source of information that could be used by other groups of practitioners [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><offsets xml_i="23542" xml_f="23544" txt_i="17479" txt_f="17481">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23551" xml_f="23553" txt_i="17481" txt_f="17483">].</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23575" xml_f="23585" txt_i="17485" txt_f="17495">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23596" xml_f="24275" txt_i="17496" txt_f="18175">PDAs have been increasingly used in clinical medicine for the delivery of information at the point of care, the collection of patient information, updating of clinical records, electronic prescribing and medical education. This pilot study integrated a combined PDA and mobile phone device into the daily schedule of a team of general surgeons, showing its usefulness primarily as a communication tool. Although we were unable measure a direct patient benefit from the use of these devices, the majority of doctors in the trial felt that having a PDA with a mobile phone as an in-built feature did help them to deliver better health care, and found this technology easy to adopt.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24282" xml_f="24787" txt_i="18176" txt_f="18681">In light of these promising initial findings, we now propose a large-scale clinical trial of the use of PDAs with built-in mobile telephones in the hospital setting. This may be a first step in developing the evidence base for a new hospital communication system that may eventually replace the quaint, but hopelessly outdated hospital pager. Other wireless technologies such as blue-tooth and wireless local area networks must also be considered in any communication system proposed for use in hospitals.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24809" xml_f="24828" txt_i="18683" txt_f="18702">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="24839" xml_f="24899" txt_i="18703" txt_f="18763">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24921" xml_f="24943" txt_i="18765" txt_f="18787">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="24954" xml_f="25318" txt_i="18788" txt_f="19152">Omer Aziz concieved and coordinated the study.
