This is mainly due to the malaria parasite becoming resistant to treatment. Many African countries are now adopting newer artemisinin-based combination therapies as first-line treatment. However other countries have put interim solutions in place before introducing artemisinin-based drugs. The combination of chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was officially adopted as first-line therapy in the Gambia in 2004. However, little data exists on the efficacy of this combination in that setting. It is also not known whether parasites resistant to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, as well as chloroquine, are common in the Gambia. In this trial, conducted in a rural town in the Gambia in 2001, the researchers randomized 500 young children presenting with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria to receive either chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, or the combination of both treatments. The researchers then looked for the presence of parasites in the blood of treated children over 28 days of follow-up. Infections following treatment were defined as either the same infection that was originally treated (a recrudescence) or a new infection. The need for rescue medication, indicating clinical failure, was also examined.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9634" xml_f="9635" txt_i="3623" txt_f="3624">

However the combination of chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine appeared to be equivalent to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in clearing parasite infection. When the researchers distinguished parasite infections into recrudescences or new infections, they found that either treatment option containing sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine prevented a recurrence of the original infection better than treatment with chloroquine. Clinical failure was also higher amongst children treated with chloroquine than those treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone or the combination. In children treated with chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, parasite infection was found in 14% of participants at 28 days of follow-up. A number of children carried parasites predicted to be resistant to both chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. However, these children were not significantly more likely to fail treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10774" xml_f="10775" txt_i="4744" txt_f="4745">

The trial is also part of an ongoing series of other studies, which will ultimately allow researchers to detect changes in the efficacy of different treatments over time, providing information about parasite selection and the useful therapeutic life of particular treatments. However, the loss to follow-up in this trial was high (between 25 and 32%, depending on the treatment arm) due to logistical constraints around the time of the Gambian national election. It is not possible to tell if data from the participants lost to follow-up would have changed the overall conclusions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11533" xml_f="11534" txt_i="5484" txt_f="5485">

Prior evidence was not strong enough to confirm the advantage of chloroquine / sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine over chloroquine alone. The identification of parasites resistant to both chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine indicates that new combination drugs are needed in this part of Africa.</offsets></p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"></page-count></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Dunyo S, Ord R, Hallett R, Jawara M, Walraven G, et al.
