Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop evidence‐based treatments. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a novel suicide prevention psychological therapy for male prisoners. To promote ecological validity by addressing the “real‐world” situation of suicidal prisoners, we involved a consultant group of ex‐offenders with past experience of being suicidal during imprisonment. Service user involvement in prison research is challenging and underdeveloped.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="hex12590-sec-0002"><title><offsets xml_i="7667" xml_f="7676" txt_i="626" txt_f="635">Objective</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7687" xml_f="7799" txt_i="636" txt_f="748">We aimed to investigate the ex‐offender service user consultants’ experiences of being involved in the research.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="hex12590-sec-0003"><title><offsets xml_i="7844" xml_f="7850" txt_i="750" txt_f="756">Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7861" xml_f="7971" txt_i="757" txt_f="867">Individual qualitative interviews were conducted and analysed using an Interpretative Phenomenology Analysis (</offsets><styled-content style="fixed-case"><offsets xml_i="8006" xml_f="8009" txt_i="867" txt_f="870">IPA</offsets></styled-content><offsets xml_i="8026" xml_f="8038" txt_i="870" txt_f="882">) framework.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="hex12590-sec-0004"><title><offsets xml_i="8083" xml_f="8103" txt_i="884" txt_f="904">Setting/participants</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8114" xml_f="8172" txt_i="905" txt_f="963">The study was conducted at a university in North England, </offsets><styled-content style="fixed-case"><offsets xml_i="8207" xml_f="8209" txt_i="963" txt_f="965">UK</offsets></styled-content><offsets xml_i="8226" xml_f="8317" txt_i="965" txt_f="1056">, comprising four ex‐offenders with experience of being suicidal during past imprisonments.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="hex12590-sec-0005"><title><offsets xml_i="8362" xml_f="8369" txt_i="1058" txt_f="1065">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8380" xml_f="8648" txt_i="1066" txt_f="1334">Two superordinate themes were identified: “Working Together” depicted participants’ perceptions of the pivotal role of good relationships with researchers, and “Journey of Change” outlined how participants’ involvement in the research impacted on their personal lives.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="hex12590-sec-0006"><title><offsets xml_i="8693" xml_f="8703" txt_i="1336" txt_f="1346">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8714" xml_f="8990" txt_i="1347" txt_f="1623">Little is known about how to successfully involve ex‐offender service users in research.
