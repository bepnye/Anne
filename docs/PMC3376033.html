The nutrition module included an introduction to types of foods, and energy contained in different foods and practical advice on how to eat healthily on a daily basis. Students were shown what high-dense-energy foods are, for example Western snacks, soft-drinks and deep-fried foods. They were encouraged to consume low-dense-energy foods, such as vegetables and tofu. They were also offered tips on how to eat healthily, e.g., chewing thoroughly, and reducing fat intake by consuming meat without skin.

Families were given the opportunity to discuss practical aspects of the CLICK-Obesity program and to extend their knowledge on healthy lifestyle and eating behaviors. The curriculum designed for parents/guardians were organized by class teachers but presented by our team members each time, unlike the class curriculum which was presented to students by classroom teachers. After school family events were also offered, these included parent–child interactive home assignments, such as identifying high-dense-energy home foods, and practicing to measure body weight and height and to calculate body mass index.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19430" xml_f="19452" txt_i="12859" txt_f="12881">d) Fun programs/events</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19459" xml_f="20531" txt_i="12882" txt_f="13954">(i) Presentation competition. Three competitions (picture painting, short paper writing and stage drama) were held in two semesters regarding (a) obesity and its associated risk to health, and (b) healthy lifestyle and behaviors against obesity in daily life. Students were encouraged to tell their own stories about healthy diet and physical activity behaviors. Picture painting, focusing on healthy lifestyle choices, and paper writing activities, focusing on healthy body weight, were implemented during the first semester. A stage drama, presenting how to keep a healthy body weight through healthy lifestyle and behaviors in daily life, was required to be presented by a classmate-team (at least two members) in the second semester. Six winners from each class were selected for each picture painting and paper writing competition, while one winner in each class was selected for stage drama show by a 7-member assessment panel, which including external experts (from the local Center for Disease Control and students’ health-care institute), teachers and classmates.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20538" xml_f="20886" txt_i="13955" txt_f="14303">(ii) ‘No unhealthy snack week’.
