The three stimuli, which were square waves with fundamental frequencies of 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz, were presented at a sound level of 70 dB and were randomly repeated three times from each sound source.

This finding reinforces the results obtained from earlier studies (</offsets><xref rid="b9-cln_69p83" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="16323" xml_f="16324" txt_i="10304" txt_f="10305">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16331" xml_f="16673" txt_i="10305" txt_f="10647">), in which it was reported that previous exposure to noise could lead to reduced sound source identification.

Additionally, the percentages of correct answers for the frequencies studied were very similar. The numbers of correct sound source localization responses were lower than those in a control population that was not exposed to noise. These findings are important because they demonstrate that it is necessary to consider the measures that should be taken to preserve the hearing of these professionals.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17820" xml_f="17835" txt_i="11664" txt_f="11679">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17846" xml_f="18068" txt_i="11680" txt_f="11902">This study was funded by the Research Support Foundation of Alagoas State (FAPEAL).
