We hypothesised, with reference to Adult learning theory that as clinicians were led to be more comprehensive in the data relayed to specialists that their clinical acumen would increase. We sought evidence for this from the greater number of referrals of patients with 'significant' bowel pathology. It is possible that the designation of 'significant' pathologies, those that were thought to be the root cause of the symptoms, including severe diverticular disease, identified the 'wrong' group of disorders and so we were unable to detect any 'significant' improvement in diagnostic acumen. In addition applying this innovation to other professional groups, for example practice nurses or involving the patient directly in documenting the clinical details may have yielded different results. We believe the software did identify the patients who met the referral criteria for urgent referral insofar as the software was programmed with the relevant algorithms. However this presupposes that the clinician systematically elicited the relevant clinical features for all symptomatic patients referred or otherwise.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30366" xml_f="30716" txt_i="20581" txt_f="20931">Secondly we did not formally evaluate whether the educational visits resulted in any improvement in knowledge or change in practitioner attitude and so could not confidently confirm that the visits were effective.
