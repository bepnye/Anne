This should probably be the case in all studies which solicit treatment assumptions. Finally, a possible explanation for the lack of difference between MPH and placebo might be that the dose was too low.

Students who thought they were given the drug recalled 54%–58% of the word lists, while those who thought they had received the placebo recalled only 34%–37%. This is independent of any pharmacologic effects of MPH, which in this study had no significant effects on verbal memory. This information may be used to dissuade students from taking stimulants such as MPH during their examination periods, thus avoiding one trap towards becoming addicted subsequently.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-prbm-6-065"><offsets xml_i="36644" xml_f="36646" txt_i="28432" txt_f="28434">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36653" xml_f="36654" txt_i="28434" txt_f="28435">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-prbm-6-065"><offsets xml_i="36697" xml_f="36699" txt_i="28435" txt_f="28437">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36706" xml_f="36904" txt_i="28437" txt_f="28635"> In addition to this, pointing towards the placebo effect indicates to students that they have the psychologic means within themselves to enhance their own study capacity without any need for drugs.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank B Bronselaer for her contribution to identifying the tests in this study, D Proot for searching for participants and providing linguistic advice, H Verdoodt and B Driesen for reading the first versions of this manuscript, J Tack, B Ressler, and the collaborators of “Ook getest op mensen” for logistic support, R Buysschaert and V Beckers for examining the participants, and S Sarre for blinding of the study drugs.
