Medications can effectively reduce positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions), but they do not meaningfully improve daily life functioning. Psychosocial evidence-based practices (EBPs) improve functioning, but these EBPs are not available to most people with schizophrenia. The field must close the research and service delivery gap by adapting EBPs for schizophrenia to facilitate widespread implementation in community settings. Our hybrid effectiveness and implementation study represents an initiative to bridge this divide. In this study we will test whether an existing EBP (i.e., Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST)) modified to work in practice settings (i.e., Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams) commonly available to persons with schizophrenia results in better consumer outcomes.

The use of standardized manuals in psychotherapy research minimizes the likelihood of contamination of treatments from one condition to another.

By challenging defeatist performance beliefs, consumers are more likely to engage in functional behaviors and use the skills they have. Consumers are introduced to the general concepts of CBT, including the relationship between thoughts, actions and feelings (generic cognitive model), automatic thoughts, thought challenging by examining evidence for beliefs, and mistakes in thinking (e.g., jumping to conclusions, fortune telling, all-or-none thinking). Through discussion, thought records, and homework assignments, consumers are taught to identify thoughts, examine relationships between thoughts, feelings and behaviors, and correct mistakes in thinking. Behavioral experiments are conducted inside and outside therapy sessions (homework), in order to gather evidence to evaluate beliefs. To simplify learning and help consumers remember and use cognitive techniques in everyday life, mnemonic aids are provided (e.g., laminated cards describing skills). For example, for thought challenging, we use an acronym, “The 3C’s: Catch it, Check it, Change it.” The “it” refers to a thought. Consumers are taught to use the 3C’s when they are experiencing unpleasant emotions or behaving in a way that interferes with goals (e.g., isolating, not filling out a job application, giving up on a class).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title><offsets xml_i="35980" xml_f="36006" txt_i="27971" txt_f="27997">CBSST social skills module</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="36017" xml_f="37145" txt_i="27998" txt_f="29126">The primary goal of this module is to improve communication skills and psychosocial interactions (e.g., how to ask someone for support).

Expressing pleasant and unpleasant feelings, and making positive requests are emphasized to improve assertive, clear, and comfortable sharing of feelings in social interactions. Improving everyday activities and functioning are common role-play topics for these skills (e.g., asking a roommate to change their behavior; asking someone to go to the movies; assertive interactions with co-workers/ employers).

Once each week, the expert consultant will use 30 minutes of the morning meeting to provide training and consultation. Also, ACT services are team-delivered (i.e., different providers typically provide services to the same consumer), so providers of past CBSST sessions must share information with providers of future sessions (e.g., weekly homework assignments, key thoughts and themes from the last session, consumer reactions/feedback about specific skills, etc.).

A demonstration of the effectiveness of ACT + CBSST and the identification of important implementation barriers and facilitators through this hybrid research study may result in greater availability of these interventions in this population. To our knowledge, this is the first effectiveness study of CBT and SST for schizophrenia implemented on ACT teams by frontline providers in the United States. Additionally, as a hybrid effectiveness and implementation study, we will identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the CBSST program, enabling us to develop guidelines that will maximize successful implementation of the program in the future.

Supervisors have also been instrumental in assisting with logistics of the implementation, including providing case managers with recorders and forms for documenting and tracking session delivery, collecting necessary forms, and providing feedback to the consultants about the consultation meetings and the study overall.

Consultants continually normalize the experience of being recorded for fidelity and provide written and verbal feedback that balances specific and directive suggestions for improving fidelity with positive reinforcement of providers’ strengths and growth. It has been helpful for consultants to identify and directly address negative beliefs and myths associated with implementing manualized interventions, such as CBSST (e.g., that CBSST is too difficult or rigid, that it will not help clients in crisis, etc.). Providers have appreciated case examples and role plays illustrating how CBSST material can be integrated into a typical ACT session and how the treatment is tailored to challenging presentations (e.g., thought disorder, negative symptoms, entrenched delusions). In addition, providers have responded positively to simple incentives including food, certificates of high-fidelity CBSST delivery, and public recognition of exceptional sessions. In general, CBSST implementation tends to be optimal when the perception that the treatment does not substantially increase staff workload or reduces burden by reducing consumer crises, and provider confidence and efficacy is strongly supported.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title><offsets xml_i="63901" xml_f="63928" txt_i="52604" txt_f="52631">Improved training materials</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="63939" xml_f="64927" txt_i="52632" txt_f="53620">Based upon feedback from the ACT providers, new training materials were developed to provide greater opportunities for observing and practicing using CBSST prior to delivering it to ACT consumers (e.g., online didactic videos and additional examples). Additionally, the CBSST workbooks were revised and abbreviated to promote ease of use for ACT providers and consumers in the community during typically brief visits when compared to a traditional office-based session. A primary goal for the revised training materials and approaches was to help ACT providers become sufficiently comfortable with the CBSST intervention so that they could naturally integrate it into their typical services and tailor it to helping consumers achieve their goals, as well as to better manage everyday and crisis situations. As providers attain competence in CBSST through practice, they begin to view these situations as good opportunities to utilize CBSST rather than as barriers to its service delivery.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title><offsets xml_i="64966" xml_f="64978" txt_i="53623" txt_f="53635">Trial status</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="64989" xml_f="65423" txt_i="53636" txt_f="54070">Study recruitment, assessment, and intervention delivery activities are ongoing for the effectiveness component of the hybrid research study.
