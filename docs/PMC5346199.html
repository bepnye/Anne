Rural residents seek care from a village-town-county three-tier healthcare delivery system. A typical village has one clinician with limited medical care training, who provides patient education, simple outpatient care and preventive care to all villagers. The village clinic, sometimes in the clinician’s home, has a small supply of medications but often lacks rudimental medications that are included in the national essential medicine list. There are no hospitals in the villages. Each town has one hospital and rural residents go to town hospitals for inpatient care and outpatient care that the village clinic is not equipped to handle.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17276" xml_f="18527" txt_i="9412" txt_f="10663">If town hospitals cannot treat the patient’s illness, the patient goes to county or city hospitals. Under the current system, in most areas, patients can also go to county or city hospitals directly without going through town hospitals, but the inpatient reimbursement rate is much lower for services provided in county or city hospitals compared to town hospitals. For example, in 2012 in Qianjiang, the inpatient policy reimbursement rate was 70% for services provided in town hospitals and 55% in county hospitals. The actual effective reimbursement rate in county hospitals was even lower, about 44% in 2012, because many services provided in county hospitals were not eligible for reimbursement. Regardless of where rural residents in Qianjiang seek their inpatient care (town, county or city), the reimbursable portion of the medical care is paid with social health insurance pooled at Qianjiang county level. The gross costs of an inpatient stay in a county hospital can easily double the cost in town hospitals for the same procedure, and the difference in costs between city and county hospitals is even larger. Residents are incentivized to seek care in lower level hospitals because of their lower gross costs and higher reimbursement rate.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title><offsets xml_i="18559" xml_f="18572" txt_i="10665" txt_f="10678">Interventions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18583" xml_f="19314" txt_i="10679" txt_f="11410">We tested two new care components: the integrated care model started on Aug 1, 2012, and the financial incentive contract started on Jun 1, 2013, (because it took some time to negotiate contracts), in comparison with usual care.

We then estimated the marginal effects and the standard errors of the interaction terms using bootstrap [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25"><offsets xml_i="34165" xml_f="34167" txt_i="24803" txt_f="24805">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34174" xml_f="34176" txt_i="24805" txt_f="24807">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34183" xml_f="34442" txt_i="24808" txt_f="25067">The project protocol was approved by the Tongji Medical College Academic Ethics Committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China (IORG No: IORG0003571).

Our observed effects are small for two main reasons: first, our interventions target on healthcare system delivery changes, which may take a long time to realize effects. Second, subjects in our study had much higher baseline blood pressure than those in previous studies and therefore are more difficult to treat, However, for subjects in our study, even a small reduction in blood pressure could result in meaningful effects on lowering hospitalizations and cardiovascular risk. Indeed, we observed that interventions reduced the rate of cardiovascular related hospitalization. A recent meta-analysis reviewed nineteen clinical trials and confirmed the effects of lowering blood pressure on reducing major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, albuminuria, and retinopathy progression [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30"><offsets xml_i="46461" xml_f="46463" txt_i="33380" txt_f="33382">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46470" xml_f="46690" txt_i="33382" txt_f="33602">].

When provider payments are aligned with total inpatient spending, providers may discourage patients from using hospital services, especially more expensive services in higher-level hospitals. If patients do not trust their doctors, which is very common in China, patients may think they were not provided the best medical treatment and thus feel worse about their own health or simply report worse health than they perceive.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47271" xml_f="48142" txt_i="34171" txt_f="35042">Our study is not without limitations. First, the financial contract in Group 2 was not fully executed. By design, the potential bonus to providers was tied with outcome-based performance measures and savings in total inpatient spending in the town. However, in reality, the assessment on performance was weak and not fully monitored. Second, our interventions were conducted in one county in China, and therefore results may not be generalizable to other areas. However, Qianjiang county is highly representative of China’s rural areas, in terms of its population size, mobility, economic development state, and prevalence rates of chronic diseases. In addition, we obtained our patient list from the national chronic disease registry for hypertension, and patients officially registered in the registry were sicker than general patients ever diagnosed with hypertension.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title><offsets xml_i="48175" xml_f="48186" txt_i="35044" txt_f="35055">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48197" xml_f="48419" txt_i="35056" txt_f="35278">Because our study groups were randomly assigned, our findings are guarded against some selection biases that are common in other recent evaluations of integrated care models that were conducted through observational data [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3"><offsets xml_i="48451" xml_f="48452" txt_i="35278" txt_f="35279">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="48459" xml_f="48461" txt_i="35279" txt_f="35281">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"><offsets xml_i="48493" xml_f="48494" txt_i="35281" txt_f="35282">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="48501" xml_f="49491" txt_i="35282" txt_f="36272">]. Taken together, our findings have important clinical and policy implications on how to better manage chronic conditions. First, the integrated care model substantially lowered blood pressure and improved patients’ health. Our findings support changing from the current fragmented care model to the more integrated, multidisciplinary-team-based care model, even in the current funding model. This result is consistent with other integrated care models that are being tried out in other countries. Second, continuous care coordination across provider disciplines and village-town-county tiers was important; so was sharing medical records among providers and developing continuous quality improvement processes. Third, combining integrated care with a new funding model further reduced blood pressure and inpatient spending, but also reduced patients’ quality of life. This suggests that financial incentives should not be too quickly introduced in rural China without further evaluations.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49498" xml_f="49913" txt_i="36273" txt_f="36688">Because the relatively low costs (USD25K) and potential savings to conduct the interventions, it is feasible to roll out the integrated care model to other rural areas in China more broadly. Most rural areas in China have the financial ability to support such a new delivery model. The key to the success is the central government’s willingness to try and the local administration team’s leadership to implement it.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49920" xml_f="50248" txt_i="36689" txt_f="37017">In sum, the integrated care model and the financial contract are effective in lowering blood pressure and reducing rates of hypertension-related hospitalization. Integrated care is also associated with better health-related quality of life. However, the long-term savings in healthcare costs from these models remain to be seen.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Four types of clinical pathways in the integrated care model</title><p>Type A for which patients first sought care in their village clinics, was a minor condition that could be treated by village clinicians. If the condition did not improve, patients were referred to town hospitals. Type B was an emergency case, defined as instant blood pressure ≥ 180/120 mmHg, and if blood pressure was not reduced by 25% within an hour, the patient was admitted to the emergency room. Type C was a complex and serious condition with complications, defined by the following criteria: 1) instant blood pressure ≥ 180/120 mmHg; 2) severely damaged target organs; and/or 3) other cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and circulatory system complications. Once village or town doctors identified a Type B or C patient, they had to contact their corresponding county hospital clinicians and transfer the patient to the relevant county hospital department. During the inpatient stay, county doctors needed to monitor the patient status and also followed up after inpatient discharge. Type D patients were newly identified patients with hypertension and had a visit directly in a county hospital without going through the clinical pathway. Once a type D patient was identified, the patient was enrolled in our integrated care pathway system, and the county provider contacted the local village clinician to start a new medical record for the patient.</p></sec></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>During the intervention period, the operations of the social health insurance in Qianjiang were reorganized from county level to city level and the Qianjiang county health bureau no longer had authority to change the reimbursement policy.
