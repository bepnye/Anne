Third, there was an unexpectedly large variability in neuropsychological performance that underpowered the study. Fourth, there was a relative lack of activity of ADC: 56% of all patients had baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HIV-1 RNA &lt;100 copies/mL and 83% had CSF β-2 microglobulin &lt;3 nmol/L at baseline.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st8"><title><offsets xml_i="9489" xml_f="9501" txt_i="1627" txt_f="1639">Conclusions:</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9512" xml_f="9856" txt_i="1640" txt_f="1984">The addition of ABC to SBG for ADC patients was not efficacious, possibly because of the inefficacy of ABC per se, baseline drug resistance, prolonged benefit from existing therapy, difficulties with sample size calculations, and lack of disease activity.

Patients with ADC experience dementia as well as disordered behavior and problems with movement and balance. ADC is now much less common in locations where patients have access to HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy), consisting of combinations of several drugs that attack the virus at different stages of its life cycle. At present, however, there are no generally accepted guidelines for the best treatment of people with ADC. It has been thought for some time that the best treatment regimens for people with ADC would include drugs that cross the barrier between blood and brain well. Shortly following the introduction of HAART, a trial was carried out to find out whether adding one particular drug, abacavir, to existing combinations of drugs would be beneficial in people with ADC. This drug is known to cross the barrier between the blood and brain. The trial enrolled HIV-positive individuals with mild to moderate ADC and who were already receiving antiretroviral drug treatment. 105 participants were assigned at random to receive either high-dose abacavir or a placebo, in addition to their existing therapy. The primary outcome of the trial was a summary of performance on a set of different tests, designed to evaluate cognitive, behavior, and movement skills, at 12 weeks. Other outcomes included levels of HIV RNA (viral load) in fluid around the brain, as well as other neurological evaluations, and the level of HIV RNA and CD4</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="11612" xml_f="11613" txt_i="3636" txt_f="3637">+</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="11619" xml_f="11665" txt_i="3637" txt_f="3683"> T cells (the cells infected by HIV) in blood.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11672" xml_f="11673" txt_i="3684" txt_f="3685">

Similarly, the levels of HIV RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid did not differ between the two groups being compared, and other neurological tests did not show any differences between the two groups. However, at 12 weeks, patients receiving abacavir were more likely to have low levels of HIV RNA in their blood, suggesting that abacavir was active against the virus, but this did not translate into an additional improvement of these patients' dementia. The overall rates of adverse events were roughly comparable between the two groups in the trial, although participants receiving abacavir were more likely to experience certain types of events, such as nausea.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12612" xml_f="12613" txt_i="4605" txt_f="4606">

These procedures help minimize the chance of bias in assigning participants to the different arms as well as in the subsequent performance of individuals within the trial and the assessment of their outcomes. Limitations in the study design have been identified. One limitation is that individuals enrolled into the trial may not in fact have been receiving their existing HAART regimen for long enough to experience its optimal effect, and therefore the improvement seen in both groups could have resulted from an ongoing response to their existing regimen. It is also possible that patients improved in their test scores over the course of the trial simply because they became more familiar with the tests and not because their condition improved. This is a problem in all such trials that try to improve mental function. Finally, a limitation may have been the inclusion of patients who did not have active disease leading to worsening dementia.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13788" xml_f="13789" txt_i="5762" txt_f="5763">

However, the trial provides several insights into the way that future studies of this type can be done, and which typically pose a number of challenging design problems. In particular, sensitive markers are needed that will allow researchers to monitor progression of ADC and patients' response to therapy.</offsets></p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"></page-count></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Brew BJ, Halman M, Catalan J, Sacktor N, Price RW, et al.

While the need for adequate brain penetration is controversial, studies addressing this issue thus far have been incomplete.

[</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b030" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="45436" xml_f="45438" txt_i="31590" txt_f="31592">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45445" xml_f="45772" txt_i="31592" txt_f="31919">]. In a small substudy, 13 children were randomized to receive ABC, ZDV, and 3TC compared to ten who received ZDV and 3TC. Approximately half in each group had neuropsychological impairment and this did not significantly change at week 48. However, there were several dropouts and the study was very significantly underpowered.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45779" xml_f="46528" txt_i="31920" txt_f="32669">Given the above-mentioned points, it seems that there is adequate theoretical reason to expect ABC to have neurological efficacy. So perhaps this did not translate into practice because of flaws in trial design. In this regard, the first concern would be the presence of pre-existing resistance to the drug. Certainly, at baseline, 90% of participants had virus with evidence of resistance to the NRTIs and two thirds of isolates had three or more NRTI-associated mutations at baseline. The latter participants had less reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA compared to those with virus with two or fewer mutations. As previously mentioned, recent data have shown that the greater the number of NRTI mutations, the greater the likelihood of ABC resistance [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b027" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46574" xml_f="46576" txt_i="32669" txt_f="32671">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46583" xml_f="46863" txt_i="32671" txt_f="32951">]. Nonetheless, despite the presence of multiple mutations, in this limited group of patients significantly more participants treated with ABC had undetectable HIV-1 RNA at week 12 in the plasma and CSF. So, while this was clearly a factor it is unlikely to be the most important.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46870" xml_f="47145" txt_i="32952" txt_f="33227">A second issue in trial design is that of the neurological stability of the patient groups at entry. An 8-wk period prior to entry was chosen because of pre-HAART data showing that the vast majority of improvement had occurred by 8 wk from commencement of a particular drug [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b004" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="47191" xml_f="47192" txt_i="33227" txt_f="33228">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47199" xml_f="47200" txt_i="33228" txt_f="33229">,</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b031" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="47246" xml_f="47248" txt_i="33229" txt_f="33231">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47255" xml_f="48238" txt_i="33231" txt_f="34214">]. It was presumed that even though some patients were on HAART, approximately half in both groups at baseline, any improvement would still have stabilized by 8 wk from commencement of the regimen. At the time, this was based on the presumption that HAART would not make a significant impact on ADC because of the limited penetration into the brain of the most common component of such a regimen, namely the PIs. At the time of the trial, HAART consisted of two NRTIs and a PI. However, the fact that both the SBG and ABC groups improved at week 12 of the study (that is, after at least 5 mo on HAART) and that there were only two ADC progressions (both in the SBG group) strongly suggest that HAART does have efficacy in ADC leading to a lengthening of the time window. While there are no precise data on progression rates prior to the introduction of HAART for the different ADC stages, the mean time to death for Stage 2 ADC was 4.6 mo and for all ADC patients the time was 6 mo [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b031" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="48284" xml_f="48286" txt_i="34214" txt_f="34216">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="48293" xml_f="48294" txt_i="34216" txt_f="34217">,</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b032" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="48340" xml_f="48342" txt_i="34217" txt_f="34219">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="48349" xml_f="49149" txt_i="34219" txt_f="35019">]. These figures therefore suggest that there should have been more ADC progressions in the study participants if HAART had no effect on dementia. The other interpretation, namely that the neuropsychological improvement was related to a learning effect for the tests seems unlikely: no similar improvement has been observed in other clinical studies and further analyses of the neuropsychological data comparing the results of testing in the memory domain (the most sensitive to learning effect) with the other tests of psychomotor function and reaction time did not show any significant differences. Thus, unlike the issue of baseline resistance, this does seem to be a major factor. In future ADC trials, patients should only be entered after a period of 5 mo on existing HAART to ensure stability.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49156" xml_f="50354" txt_i="35020" txt_f="36218">A third issue in study design relates to whether or not the trial was appropriately powered. The sample size calculation was based on an estimated SD of 0.75, a difference between treatment group responses of 0.60, and a dropout rate of 20%–25% giving the study a 90% power. These estimates had been derived from previous MACS studies. However, the observed SDs on the change in neuropsychological perfor-mance from baseline were 1.27 (ABC + SBG group) and 1.15 (SBG group). Because the variability of the neuropsychological data was much greater than expected, the likelihood of detecting any treatment differences was compromised. Indeed the power of the study was reduced to 52%. With the same sample size, but with the larger SD of 1.20, only differences between treatment group responses on the order of 0.96 would have been detected. Had the study been planned with an SD of 1.20 (using all other assumptions) rather than 0.75, approximately 115 patients per treatment group (that is, approximately twice the number enrolled) would have been required. It should be noted that two HAART era studies conducted after the completion of this study also showed unexpectedly large SDs of 1 and 1.5 [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b033" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="50400" xml_f="50402" txt_i="36218" txt_f="36220">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="50409" xml_f="50410" txt_i="36220" txt_f="36221">,</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b034" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="50456" xml_f="50458" txt_i="36221" txt_f="36223">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="50465" xml_f="50673" txt_i="36223" txt_f="36431">]. It therefore seems that the MACS cohort data that were used in the power analyses do not reflect ADC patients in the HAART era. Indeed, future trial designs should utilize these sample size re-estimations.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="50680" xml_f="51360" txt_i="36432" txt_f="37112">Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the study was designed to include participants with a diagnosis of ADC not confounded by other illnesses, but there was no provision to restrict entry to those who had “active” disease (that is, ongoing brain damage). Some patients may have had virologically or immunologically inactive disease while others may have been in a “reparative” phase, perhaps analogous to head injury or stroke patients who may take months to slowly improve after the initial insult. Studies have shown a correlation between ADC severity and CSF HIV-1 RNA and β-2 microglobulin levels when used in pre-HAART era ADC patients without other confounding conditions [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b031" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="51406" xml_f="51408" txt_i="37112" txt_f="37114">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="51415" xml_f="52620" txt_i="37114" txt_f="38313">]. However, there are no consensus criteria by which “active” versus “burnt out” disease versus a “reparative” phase can be differentiated. The fact that 56% of participants had a CSF HIV-1 RNA level below 100 copies/mL at baseline strongly suggests that many participants had a component of their neurological deficit that was unlikely to be driven by ongoing viral replication, and hence unlikely to be reversed by antiretroviral agents. Moreover, the fact that 83% of participants had CSF β-2 microglobulin concentrations that were normal for an HIV-infected population also suggests that most patients had a significant component of their deficit that was not driven by immune activation or active viral replication. How can this lack of virological and immunological activity be reconciled with the fact that most of the patients improved? We suggest that this may be related to the patients being in a reparative phase of the illness: possibly new synaptic connections are being made. It could be hypothesized that CSF HIV-1 RNA &gt;100 copies/mL and β-2 microglobulin &gt;3 nmoles/L should identify “active” ADC. However, in a recent manuscript, we thoroughly explored this with a negative result [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b035" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="52666" xml_f="52668" txt_i="38313" txt_f="38315">35</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="52675" xml_f="53530" txt_i="38315" txt_f="39170">]. Elevation or non-elevation of any one or combination of CSF markers at entry did not predict stability, improvement, or worsening of ADC at week 12, although there was a weak negative association with the degree of elevation of CSF viral load at entry. Future studies will need to focus on markers that can identify active ADC, inactive or “burnt out” ADC, and address the possibility of some patients entering a reparative phase. It is still possible that CSF HIV viral load may be a good marker of activity if the limit of detection can be reliably measured down to 10 cpml, for example. Thus, the issue of CSF markers will need to be approached in two ways: the refinement of existing markers with greater sensitivity and the development of new markers. Neuroimaging with spectroscopic analyses may also be able to address the issue of ADC activity.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="53537" xml_f="53969" txt_i="39171" txt_f="39603">Moreover, this study highlights an important change in CSF ADC markers in HAART-treated patients. No longer does the CSF compartment as assessed by HIV RNA and immune activation markers such as β-2 microglobulin reflect what is occurring in the brain: there is no relationship to the severity of ADC or to the risk of its worsening. This has been confirmed independently in another publication using a different cohort of patients [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b036" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="54015" xml_f="54017" txt_i="39603" txt_f="39605">36</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="54024" xml_f="54342" txt_i="39605" txt_f="39923">]. There are two explanations: either the CSF compartment still reflects brain disease, but current CSF markers are insensitive, or the CSF compartment has become “separate” to the brain through HAART—perhaps through differential activity in these compartments. Future studies will need to address these possibilities.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title><offsets xml_i="54373" xml_f="54389" txt_i="39925" txt_f="39941">Overall Evidence</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="54400" xml_f="56151" txt_i="39942" txt_f="41693">This study highlights four issues that are critical in the design of future ADC trials and in individual patient management. Firstly, if a new antiretroviral agent is to be trialed in ADC the details of resistance mutations to it should be known before commencement of the trial so that patients with resistant virus can be excluded from the trial. A potential means of circumventing this problem in the case of a novel agent where resistance patterns have not yet been described (this was the case for ABC at the beginning of this trial) would be to recruit only antiretroviral naïve patients. However, this would mean that a large number of study sites would have to be involved to enable the requisite number of patients to be reached. Secondly, HAART has a beneficial effect on ADC which continues for at least 5 mo after commencement of therapy. Thus, future ADC trials should enroll patients after at least 5 mo of HAART. Thirdly, the variability in neuropsychological performance over time is greater than previously reported. These data should be used to estimate the required sample size in future trials. Fourthly, ADC patients should only be recruited into future anti-retroviral trials if they have active virally mediated ADC. At an individual patient level, it is not possible to be certain of the degree of activity of ADC in a HAART-treated patient. Consequently, clinicians are forced to consider an empirical trial either of intensification or change of HAART. Thus, markers that allow “real time” evaluation of ADC activity, as opposed to its retrospective identification by history, are urgently needed. In this regard, emerging data on the CSF concentrations of the neuronal markers neurofilament and perhaps t-tau are promising [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b037" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="56197" xml_f="56199" txt_i="41693" txt_f="41695">37</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="56206" xml_f="56207" txt_i="41695" txt_f="41696">–</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0020013-b039" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="56253" xml_f="56255" txt_i="41696" txt_f="41698">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="56262" xml_f="56264" txt_i="41698" txt_f="41700">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="56271" xml_f="56453" txt_i="41701" txt_f="41883">While this trial delivered a negative result, it highlights important factors that must be incorporated into a new design methodology for future ADC trials in HAART-treated patients.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title><offsets xml_i="56523" xml_f="56545" txt_i="41886" txt_f="41908">Supporting Information</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020013-sd001"><label><offsets xml_i="56634" xml_f="56651" txt_i="41909" txt_f="41926">CONSORT Checklist</offsets></label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020013.sd001.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="56714" xml_f="56750" txt_i="41926" txt_f="41962">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media><p><offsets xml_i="56775" xml_f="56786" txt_i="41963" txt_f="41974">(50 KB PDF)</offsets></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020013-sd002"><label><offsets xml_i="56896" xml_f="56910" txt_i="41975" txt_f="41989">Trial Protocol</offsets></label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020013.sd002.pdf"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="56973" xml_f="57009" txt_i="41989" txt_f="42025">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media><p><offsets xml_i="57034" xml_f="57046" txt_i="42026" txt_f="42038">(4.5 MB PDF)</offsets></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020013-sd003"><label><offsets xml_i="57156" xml_f="57188" txt_i="42039" txt_f="42071">Text S1 Clinical Evaluation Form</offsets></label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020013.sd003.pdf"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="57251" xml_f="57287" txt_i="42071" txt_f="42107">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media><p><offsets xml_i="57312" xml_f="57324" txt_i="42108" txt_f="42120">(1.7 MB PDF)</offsets></p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the patients participating in the study, the technical and clinical staff from all centres, and, in particular, S.
