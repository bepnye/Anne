The findings of the study restate the importance of continued monitoring of patients with supportive periodontal therapy as enhanced antioxidant status was evident in the apparently “healthy” group as well. There are limited studies focusing on the antioxidant profile following nonsurgical treatment. Hence, the information obtained from this study may provide scope for use of external antioxidant therapy in the management of periodontitis, especially among those patients refractory to conventional treatment.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the postgraduates and faculty of the department of Biochemistry, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, India for their help throughout the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Canacki</surname><given-names>CF</given-names></name><name><surname>Cicek</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Canacki</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Reactive oxygen species and human inflammatory periodontal diseases</article-title><source>Biochemistry (Mosc)</source><year>2005</year><volume>70</volume><fpage>619</fpage><lpage>28</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16038603</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fridovich</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub>-), Superoxide dismutases and related matters</article-title><source>J Biol Chem</source><year>1997</year><volume>272</volume><fpage>515</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jacoby</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>LW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The electron microscopic immunolocalization of a copper–zinc superoxide dismutase in association with collagen fibers of periodontal soft tissues</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1991</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>413</fpage><lpage>20</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1920007</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Na</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>OS</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Expression of Superoxide dismutase isoforms in inflamed gingiva</article-title><source>J Korean Acad Periodontol</source><year>2006</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>97</fpage><lpage>112</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chapple</surname><given-names>IL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The role of free radicals and antioxidants in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory periodontal diseases</article-title><source>Mol Pathol</source><year>1996</year><volume>49</volume><fpage>247</fpage><lpage>55</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Calder</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Rice-Evans</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antioxidant activity of saliva and periodontal disease</article-title><source>Free Radic Res</source><year>1994</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>417</fpage><lpage>25</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7834056</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Silness</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Loe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal Disease in Pregnancy.
