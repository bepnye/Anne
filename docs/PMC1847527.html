With the co-operation of the local research networks in Tayside and Fife we asked general practitioners to notify us of all patients presenting with Bell's palsy over a period of one month. As a result of this exercise we determined that we would be able to recruit 1/3 of those presenting within 48 hours of diagnosis. Of those we assumed that 2/3 would remain in the trial for review at 9 months.

However, good quality research into effective recruitment to trials is sparse and there is a need for a more comprehensive evidence base. Primary care trialists should describe their experiences of the methods used to persuade patients to participate in their trials when publishing their results.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="32437" xml_f="32456" txt_i="24960" txt_f="24979">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32467" xml_f="32527" txt_i="24980" txt_f="25040">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="32549" xml_f="32571" txt_i="25042" txt_f="25064">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32582" xml_f="32844" txt_i="25065" txt_f="25327">BM planned and wrote the paper, FD co-ordinated the Bell's palsy trial and helped plan and write the paper, VH helped plan and write the paper, FS led the Bell's palsy trial and helped plan and write the paper.
