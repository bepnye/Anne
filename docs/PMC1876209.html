That rule was not followed in this study, as the aim was to find matches in SNOMED CT to every object present in a category. If 'and' means 'and/or' in all categories in ICD-10/KSH97-P, it is not obvious why the objects should be aggregated in a category the way they are. An example of this is 'Somnolence, stupor and coma'. This absent 'and/or' rule generates ambiguity both regarding interpretation of the meaning of a category and the correct way to map to SNOMED CT concepts.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="31896" xml_f="32276" txt_i="25664" txt_f="26044">Another example of difficulties in interpreting category meaning in KSH97-P is the so-called 'recommended term' for each category, which is a 'short term' that often narrowed and sometimes confused the concept meaning. One example of that is the short term 'Poisoning by drugs' that refers to 'Poisoning by drugs, medicaments and biological substances', which is a wider category.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32283" xml_f="32690" txt_i="26045" txt_f="26452">The method of combining several SNOMED CT concepts (post coordination) was not used. It is most likely possible to obtain a higher rate of equally chosen categories between SNOMED CT and KSH97/ICD-10 if post coordination is used, as shown in a study where the use of compositional concepts provided significant improvement in the content coverage of common problem statements by SNOMED CT (92.3% vs. 51.4% [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"><offsets xml_i="32722" xml_f="32724" txt_i="26452" txt_f="26454">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32731" xml_f="33191" txt_i="26454" txt_f="26914">]. However, post coordination demands advanced knowledge of the post coordination rules, which is the main reason the method was not used in this study. The assignment of the 'partly concordant' concepts into three groups showed that both coders found a high percentage of the chosen SNOMED CT concepts to be more specific than the source (KSH97-P). This implies that a mapping from ICD 10 categories to SNOMED CT concepts would benefit from post coordination.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33198" xml_f="34089" txt_i="26915" txt_f="27806">A limitation of this study is the use of an entirely manual mapping process using the Clue Browser. Manual browsing can lead to low recall. One of the reasons for using a completely manual mapping method in the present study was that KSH97-P is a small classification with 972 categories, which made it easy to perform the manual method and also provided valuable insight into the coding systems. Also, SNOMED CT is not translated into Swedish, which is required when automated lexical mappings are used. The necessary translations have complicated the matching process. The English terminology used in ICD-10 and the Swedish classifications based on ICD-10 are somewhat different from the translation and terminology of MeSH and Swedish MeSH. In this study, several concepts in SNOMED CT had terminology that was more similar to that of MeSH than to ICD-10, but the opposite was also found.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34096" xml_f="34362" txt_i="27807" txt_f="28073">The translation issues in this study show that a possible translation of SNOMED CT into Swedish should also include deliberate decisions regarding rules that conform or do not conform to earlier translations of ICD-10 and other classifications translated to Swedish.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34369" xml_f="34719" txt_i="28074" txt_f="28424">It has been suggested that cross-mappings between SNOMED CT and classifications like ICD-10 should maximise the value of the clinical data and the benefits of an EHR system. Interpretation of epidemiological statistics could benefit from the use of SNOMED CT when analysing diagnostic categories from ICD-10 in patient records in primary health care.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34741" xml_f="34751" txt_i="28426" txt_f="28436">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34762" xml_f="35158" txt_i="28437" txt_f="28833">Mapping from ICD-10-categories to SNOMED CT needs clear and extensive rules. It is possible to reach high intercoder reliability in mapping from ICD-10-categories to SNOMED CT. However, several obstacles to high quality mapping remain due to structure and content characteristics in both coding systems.
