The project comprised two intervention studies, Healthy Directions–Small Business (HD–SB) and Healthy Directions–Health Centers (HD–HC), and a cancer prevention policy model-analysis project. The intervention projects were group-randomized controlled studies that tested the shared primary hypotheses that mean levels of dietary and physical activity outcomes would improve more significantly in the intervention group than in the control group.

Using this framework, the social context in which people live was incorporated into the design and delivery of the interventions. This framework encompasses several factors, including individual factors (e.g., material circumstances), interpersonal factors (e.g., family roles and responsibilities), organizational factors (e.g., access to health care), and community factors (e.g., neighborhood safety). In contrast to interventions designed for a specific racial or ethnic group, we used this framework to design interventions that were suitable for a multiracial and multiethnic population.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7749" xml_f="7967" txt_i="3767" txt_f="3985">HD–SB was a worksite-based intervention study designed to test the effectiveness of an integrated health promotion and occupational health protection intervention in 26 small manufacturing businesses in Massachusetts (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="7998" xml_f="7999" txt_i="3985" txt_f="3986">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8006" xml_f="8109" txt_i="3986" txt_f="4089">). HD–HC was a health-center–based intervention in 10 community health centers in metropolitan Boston (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="8140" xml_f="8141" txt_i="4089" txt_f="4090">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8148" xml_f="8523" txt_i="4090" txt_f="4465">).
