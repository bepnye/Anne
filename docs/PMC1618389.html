After entering the LM answer, students in group A were given the chance to type their answer term into a additional text cell, immediately following the LM window. This additional text cell is not a usual part of the LM questions but was included in our study to test the handling of LM answers, in case the answer was not included in the list or the LM list would not function properly.

Apart from one term (dextrose), all terms written down in the OE text cell were included in the LM list. Most likely these problems were caused by slips and handling errors in using the LM list.

This means that the incorrect answers did not result from an incomplete LM list but from difficulties in answering the questions correctly. After a manual evaluation of all OEQs seven students could improve their score and finally pass the exam. In order to minimize mistakes that are caused by slips and handling errors, students should be given the opportunity to gain some experience with the LM format during the term.

The fact that for certain items more answers were correct and had to be marked to score a point resulted in a higher degree of difficulty.

It remains unclear whether the content of LMQs or OEQs or the LM or OE format alone resulted in a lower degree of difficulty. In our study, most LMQs/OEQs were used to evaluate knowledge related to diagnosis (e.g. ketoacidosis, pernicious anaemia, hypoglycemia), diagnostic procedure (e.g. potassium test) and therapy (e.g. metformin, insulin) in the key feature cases.

The small number of LMQs is due to the fact that in a real exam situation an exclusive use of LMQs does not appear to be reasonable.

Each case study author had the opportunity to use LMQs and therefore choose an arbitrary number of answers and distractors. This makes the system prone to errors and warrants a central management of the LM list to avoid double entries, orthographic mistakes and general chaos. Different LM lists for diagnoses, diagnostic procedures and therapies should be considered to achieve a better overview and manageability. The ICD 10, for example, could serve as a list of diagnoses. In the future the scrollable pop-up menu could be omitted. The students are meant to develop an answer spontaneously and enter it into the LM answer field to avoid searching for an appropriate answer in the LM list. In this respect the format differs from classical MCQ and extended-matching MCQ. Furthermore, the terms displayed in an alphabetical order in the pop-up menu do not necessarily constitute suitable distractors.

This problem could be reduced if students would use this question format more frequently. However, the length of the LM list was not a significant problem.
