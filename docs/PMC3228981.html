During the screening visit (14 days prior to the first treatment day), demographic data, vital signs, general physical examinations, concomitant medications, medical history, concurrent diseases, laboratory and pregnancy tests and current IBS symptoms were obtained. After this visit, all the prohibited drugs were held at least 1 week prior to the randomization. On day 1 of visit 2, treatment assignment was based on pre-generated permuted block randomization scheme. The block size of four was used to enroll subjects with a 1:1 ratio of the OB arm to controlled mebeverine arm. Clinical evaluation was performed again to confirm the eligibility and to record the IBS symptomatic baselines. After randomization, the eligible subjects were provided with a patient diary record and were treated using either OB or mebeverine for a total of 8 weeks in a double-blind method. They were instructed to come back for the 3rd visit at the end of 4th week (within ± 5 days treatment window) after randomization. Similar clinical evaluation was performed to assess their treating efficacy and safety. Patient's diary record was collected and a new card was given again. Unused study medications were collected to document drug accountability. Each subject was prescribed with the similarly coded medications for another 4-week treatment period. Final visit was performed at the end of 8th week after randomization. The efficacy and adverse events were recorded again.

The APDFS scored at visit 2 served as baseline and was re-evaluated at the ends of 4th and 8th week after treatment, respectively. The abdominal pain/discomfort intensity was subjectively scored into four categories: score 0 = absent; score 1 = mild; score 2 = moderate; and score 3 = severe. Besides, a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) to record grades of flatulence, abdominal bloating and satisfied stool frequency by the subjects was instructed by oral and written information before the assessment. The 0 cm end means "no symptom" or "normal," whereas the 10 cm end indicates the "worst bowel symptom" or "most intolerable." Abdominal pain/discomfort intensity and VAS scores at visit 2 served as the baselines and the differences of pre- and post-treatment VAS scores at final visit were used for the secondary endpoints. At the final visit, subjects and investigators completed a global assessment to the overall responses after trial, respectively. The global assessment was a 5-point scale, using the following definition: 0 = worsened, 1 = no change, 2 = slightly improved, 3 = improved and 4 = significantly improved.
