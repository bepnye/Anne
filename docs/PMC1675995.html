We included only the double blind, parallel design studies with patients randomized to either paroxetine or placebo, as recognized by GSK in the Briefing Document. These 19 studies contained 3455 and 1978 patients to the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. They resulted in 11 and 1 suicide attempts, respectively, as compared to 7 and 1 in our study. The studies lasted 6 – 12 weeks, and we obtained 601 and 333 patient years in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. Since we did not have access to the points of time of censoring, we were not able to correct for this when computing the patient years. We took the same model approach as in our article, and refer to it for details regarding the model. We let θp and θd be the mean number, or intensity, per year of a suicide attempt for a random patient in the 19 studies in the placebo and treatment group, respectively. We performed simulations by making 80000 random draws of θp and θd, from their independent posterior distributions. We computed the logarithms of the ratios θd/θp, and constructed posterior probability density plots by applying a standard density estimation technique to these 80000 numbers. (The logarithm was introduced to avoid an unwelcome feature of the density estimation method). Note that the logarithm of the ratio θd/θp is greater than zero whenever θd is greater than θp. Hence, we calculated the probabilities that medication with paroxetine is associated with an increased intensity of a suicide attempt per year as the proportions of logarithmic ratios greater than zero in the samples. We applied three different prior assumptions based on earlier work by others, as described in the article. We chose to express the pessimistic view as equivalent to observing 0.86 events with paroxetine during 50 patient years and 0.43 with placebo during 50 patient years, adding up to 1.29 attempts per 100 patient years, which is similar to the observed average value for paroxetine and placebo taken together. We based the calculations on a total of only 100 patient years in the prior, compared to 934 patient years in the real data, in order to increase the importance of the real data over the prior information. For the slightly optimistic and slightly pessimistic priors we assigned the numbers of suicidal patients on paroxetine and placebo per 50 patient years to be respectively 0.58 and 0.71 and vice versa. We found that the posterior probability that medication with paroxetine is associated with an increased intensity per year of a suicide attempt is 0.99 with the pessimistic prior, 0.98 with the slightly optimistic prior and 0.99 with the slightly pessimistic prior. Hence, we can be at least 98 % sure that paroxetine increases suicide attempts. This is stronger evidence than the p value equal to 0.058 given in the Briefing Document [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="7981" xml_f="7982" txt_i="4551" txt_f="4552">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7989" xml_f="8081" txt_i="4552" txt_f="4644">].

They state that "analysis was based solely on early data submitted to regulatory authorities in 1989. The studies analyzed included only 916 paroxetine-treated patients. Today we have data from more than 13,000 adult patients treated with paroxetine in well-controlled clinical trials." Interestingly, GSK has now in the Briefing Document reduced the corresponding number to 3455 and also admitted that they previously had several patients with a history of suicide attempts from an earlier trial placed in the treatment and placebo groups. With such a case history these patients were more likely to attempt suicide again. They should obviously not have been included since they blurred the results. This can be described as 'data-drowning', and is at least poor methodology.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9865" xml_f="10246" txt_i="6016" txt_f="6397">One item in the comment by GSK concerns two cases that they believe we had misplaced. One patient (no 1.12.037) was claimed to show only suicidal ideation but has by GSK in the Briefing Document been re-classified to represent a suicide attempt. The other patient (no 04.02.056) was from a cross over continuation study. We do not agree that this patient should have been excluded.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10253" xml_f="10813" txt_i="6398" txt_f="6958">GlaxoSmithKline state in their comment to our article that the risk may be closely related to the point of time observed in a study, and further that they would expect to have 6 attempts in the treatment group out of a total events of 8. The number is more precisely 5.79. Hence, our number 7 represents a 20.9 % increase compared to what is expected. They apply a Fishers Exact Test, which in our opinion is a very coarse method.

This hypothesis is meaningless. No one believes that the rates for these two groups are exactly equal. Secondly, we do not in any way attempt to do any form of hypothesis testing. We are merely computing the probability that medication with paroxetine is associated with an increased intensity per year of suicide attempts. GSK questions our statement that '...the data strongly suggest that the use of SSRIs is connected with an increased intensity of suicide attempts per year'. We feel that this is all about understanding and accepting the Bayesian approach as a way of analysing data. Recently FDA issued a drafted guidance for using Bayesian statistics in clinical trials [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="11917" xml_f="11918" txt_i="7987" txt_f="7988">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11925" xml_f="12192" txt_i="7988" txt_f="8255">].

Moreover, information from studies on antidepressants and other drugs must be made open for researchers and presented in the most informative way possible. We believe that this would create an open minded, trusting dialogue between consumers, manufacturers and scientists working towards the same goal: finding the best and safest treatment for the patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="12853" xml_f="12872" txt_i="8890" txt_f="8909">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12883" xml_f="12943" txt_i="8910" txt_f="8970">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="12965" xml_f="12987" txt_i="8972" txt_f="8994">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12998" xml_f="13170" txt_i="8995" txt_f="9167">IA collected the data, presented the problem and drafted the manuscript along with BN, who suggested the statistical solution based on earlier work by the present authors [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="13201" xml_f="13202" txt_i="9167" txt_f="9168">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13209" xml_f="13333" txt_i="9168" txt_f="9292">]; IFT did the computations and took part in the planning along with JG.
