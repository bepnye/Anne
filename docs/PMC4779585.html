Not only was the acute effect of protein ingestion examined, but also the accumulated effects during a strenuous training camp (25–29 cycling hours within 6 days). The main findings of the present study were that compared to isocaloric ingestion of carbohydrate, partial substitution of carbohydrates with whey protein hydrolysate during exercise did not significantly reduce the decline in performance after 4–5 h cycling or after five days of strenuous training. Furthermore, the intake of protein during training did not have a marked influence on the changes in markers of muscle damage (CK and LDH), cortisol, or immune function (salivary IgA) during the training camp.</offsets></p><sec id="Sec21"><title><offsets xml_i="38915" xml_f="38967" txt_i="27929" txt_f="27981">Acute effects of ingestion of protein on performance</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38978" xml_f="39121" txt_i="27982" txt_f="28125">Potential positive effects of protein ingestion, such as glycogen sparing, maintaining Krebs cycle intermediates, or reducing central fatigue [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31"><offsets xml_i="39154" xml_f="39156" txt_i="28125" txt_f="28127">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39163" xml_f="39623" txt_i="28127" txt_f="28587">], have led to the hypothesis that protein ingestion during exercise would improve endurance performance.
