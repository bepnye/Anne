The prospectively defined goal of these analyses was to determine if benefits might accrue over time in patients who developed prospectively defined antibody titers (≥1:2,200) that were considered adequately therapeutic in the phase 2a study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34443" xml_f="35207" txt_i="27676" txt_f="28440">This follow-up study suggests that 1 to 3 doses of AN1792 administered to patients with mild-to-moderate AD may have had long-term clinical benefits in patients who developed anti-AN1792 antibodies. Patients classified as antibody responders at the end of the phase 2a study retained low but persistent anti-AN1792 antibody titers after approximately 4.6 years. Compared with placebo-treated patients, antibody responders demonstrated significantly less impairment in activities of daily living and significantly less dependence on caregivers. A higher percentage of antibody responders remained at home and a lower percentage were institutionalized. These results provide further support for the Aβ immunotherapeutic approach in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35214" xml_f="36375" txt_i="28441" txt_f="29602">In contrast to testing of functional and dependence measures (for which caregiver assessments were available for the majority of participating subjects), fewer assessments of cognitive outcomes (including the NTB, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog) were able to be performed, as patients became less amenable to or were unable to undergo cognitive evaluation due to disease progression. For all cognitive outcomes, there were relatively fewer placebo-treated patients eligible for cognitive testing than antibody responders. Therefore, comparisons of cognitive function in this follow-up study may not be representative of the entire placebo-treated group, and may favor the assessment of placebo-treated patients who were less impaired and capable of undergoing cognitive testing. Despite this potential bias to include better-performing placebo-treated patients in the cognitive analyses, antibody responders tended to perform better on the memory component of the NTB. They demonstrated significantly less decline on a memory subtest of the NTB (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test – Delayed Recall) and similar declines compared with placebo on the other cognitive outcomes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36382" xml_f="36805" txt_i="29603" txt_f="30026">A similar overall incidence of SAEs for placebo-treated patients compared with antibody responders was observed. No SAEs were considered by the investigator to be treatment related. Although dosing in the phase 2a study was halted after 18 patients (6.0%) developed encephalitis, no new cases of encephalitis were reported after 4.6 years in this follow-up study, and similar survival was observed between treatment groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36812" xml_f="38074" txt_i="30027" txt_f="31289">Antibody responders in the phase 2a study demonstrated increased brain volume loss and increased ventricular enlargement over 11 months of follow up. In the small sample of patients who had MRI scans in this follow-up study, brain volume loss in antibody responders from the time of the last phase 2a study visit was similar to changes observed in placebo-treated patients. Ventricular enlargement was still significantly greater in antibody responders when compared with baseline measurements in the phase 2a study, but not when compared with the final scan. When compared with the final scan performed in the original study we were not able to show significant differences between antibody responders and placebo-treated patients on any MRI measures (whole brain or hippocampal loss and ventricular enlargement). It is tempting to speculate that rates of loss were similar between the two groups after the end of the phase 2a study; however, due to the small numbers of subjects, the study had very limited power to detect any such differences. Although firm conclusions cannot be drawn, this suggests that there continues to be dissociation, as observed in our original report, of better cognitive or functional performance despite greater brain volume loss [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><offsets xml_i="38106" xml_f="38108" txt_i="31289" txt_f="31291">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38115" xml_f="38227" txt_i="31291" txt_f="31403">].

This finding is particularly noteworthy because only residual low titers were observed after long-term follow up.

In the follow-up study reported here, a greater percentage of antibody responders performed the NTB than placebo-treated patients. Similarly, relatively fewer placebo-treated patients were administered the ADAS-Cog and MMSE compared with antibody responders. No apparent benefits were detected in antibody responders compared with placebo-treated patients among the testable subjects on the ADAS-Cog or MMSE. It is possible that amyloid-targeted immunotherapies have a greater effect on the retention of memory-related functions than on other cognitive domains. Alternatively, the lack of benefit seen on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog may be confounded if only the less impaired placebo-treated patients capable of undergoing cognitive testing were assessed. The latter explanation is supported by the significant treatment effects seen on the DAD and Dependence Scale in whom data on more patients was available.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40272" xml_f="41483" txt_i="33277" txt_f="34488">A limitation of this study was that only a small proportion of the subjects could be reassessed this long after the start of the original phase 2a study; the proportion that could be restudied with MRI was inevitably even smaller. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that after approximately 4.6 years, patients classified as responders to initial therapy with AN1792 retained detectable levels of anti-AN1792 antibody. Moreover, antibody responders demonstrated functional and dependence benefits compared with placebo-treated patients, with comparable safety and survival observed between treatment groups. No SAEs were considered treatment related, and no additional cases of encephalitis were reported. Placebo-treated patients and antibody responders did not demonstrate significant differences in loss of brain volume approximately 3.6 years from the end of the phase 2a study. These studies suggest that Aβ remains a valid target for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD, demonstrating that strategies to reduce Aβ may have the potential to sustain important clinical benefits in patients with AD. A number of different immunotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of AD are currently being studied. </offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="41505" xml_f="41516" txt_i="34490" txt_f="34501">DISCLOSURES</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="41527" xml_f="41902" txt_i="34502" txt_f="34877">C.
