One biological test which has been proposed is the comparison of erythrocyte size, as determined by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), measured pre-treatment and following initiation. MCV measurement is standard on modern fully-automated haematology instruments that use light scatter technology. A dilute red cell suspension passes single file in front of a light source and scattered light is detected by a photomultiplier and is converted to an electrical impulse. The degree of scatter is proportional to the surface areas of the erythrocyte thus providing an estimation of cell volume.

Although at 4 weeks self-reported adherence levels were, indeed, lower for non-responders, by 12 weeks the trend had been reversed with, more or less, all non-responders claiming to be highly adherent. Clearly, the lack of sufficient fall in HIV RNA levels may not necessarily be related to non-adherence although this is perhaps usually the case. Other reasons can include existence of drug resistance and absorption issues. At any rate, our results do support the need to re-assess the prescribed cART regimen for patients whose MCV levels fail to increase by at least 8% 12 weeks after initiation of therapy particularly as there is also little differentiation in the increase in MCV levels in those reporting full adherence and those not.
