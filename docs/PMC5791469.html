The education content in the first session included importance, characteristics, benefits, and side-effects of screening tests at first semester as well as characteristics of children with chromosomal anomalies and open neural tube defects and the second session consists of screening at second semester and diagnostic tests during pregnancy period. The education content in both sessions in face-to-face education group was presented using explanatory education method along with giving various images regarding fetal anomalies, and then questions and answers were proposed and also in group education class (5-member groups and 16 groups totally) education was held by lecture in both sessions along with powerpoint software and then questions and answers were given and at the end of first session education package (including the education booklet about screening and diagnostic tests during pregnancy period with these contents: importance, characteristics, side-effects of screening tests at first and second semesters and diagnostic tests and characteristics of children with chromosomal anomalies and open neural tube defects) was prepared by researcher and given to them for reading at home. Education course was held by researcher and education period was held in two sessions before both education groups in 45–60 min the usual care was executed for pregnant women by midwives in the control group.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20642" xml_f="20775" txt_i="15095" txt_f="15228">The informed choice questionnaire and decisional conflict scale were completed in two phases before intervention and during the 20–22</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="20780" xml_f="20782" txt_i="15228" txt_f="15230">nd</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="20788" xml_f="21093" txt_i="15230" txt_f="15535"> week of pregnancy.
