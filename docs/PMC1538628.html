A minimum of two 6 minutes corridor walk test once a week over a two-week period will be performed to measure functional class.

Therefore, reduction in myocardial oxygen demand due to beta-blockade could be expected to be beneficial in this situation, even in non ischemic CHF patients. Second the reduction in sudden cardiac deaths and serious ventricular arrhythmias suggest that an anti arrhythmic effect is an important component of beta-blockade. This anti-arrhythmic effect is explicable not only on an anti-ischemic basis but also by blockade of sympathetic activity, which is indeed increased in patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy. Third, prolonged activation of the sympathetic nervous system can accelerate the progression of heart failure, and the rate of progression can be substantially decreased using pharmacological agents that interfere with sympathetic activity in the heart and peripheral blood vessels. There is clear evidence of increased circulating beta-adrenergic antibodies in Chagas' disease providing further theoretical support for the use of beta-adrenergic blockade in this group of patients.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14500" xml_f="15526" txt_i="9322" txt_f="10345">Beta-blockers already proven to be beneficial in CHF patients are metoprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol, drugs which have been tested in over 10.000 patients in more than 20 placebo-controlled clinical trials enrolling men and women with systolic dysfunction due to ischemia, hypertension and dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

Experimental and clinical evidence supports the fact that CCM may be primarily an adrenergic cardiomyopathy. Circulating antibodies to beta-adrenergic receptors have recently been described by Esterin-Borda et al providing further support to the "adrenergic hypothesis". A marked reduction in overall mortality and significant improvement in quality of life, HF hospital admissions, reduction in sudden cardiac death have been reported by the mayor clinical trial using beta-adrenergic blockade. The CIBIS trials using Bisoprolol have definitely established the beneficial effects of this compound in patients with both ischemic and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and HF. We therefore hypothesize that administration of Bisoprolol compared to placebo in patients with CCC on standard HF therapy (Digoxin, ACEi, Diuretics) will have a 30% RR in a specified predetermined composite outcome.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18184" xml_f="18199" txt_i="12872" txt_f="12887">Expected impact</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18210" xml_f="18531" txt_i="12888" txt_f="13209">We expect that Bisoprolol in patients with CCM will determine a 30% relative risk reduction in mortality and morbidity.

Safety aspects and more specifically severe bradycardia, heart block, severe hypotension will be monitored.

These reviews will normally occur at regular intervals. The DSMB Associated Statistician will prepare a report of aggregate data summaries and individual patient data listings, where appropriate, for each treatment group. This report will be circulated to each member of the DSMB at least one week prior to their collective review. The committee will then convene, either by face-to-face meeting or by telephone conference call, to make its recommendation to the Operations Committee with respect to continuance of the trial. A formal written communication to the Chairman of the Operations Committee will then follow. Minutes of all official meetings of the DSMB will ultimately be part of the Sponsor's master files (archives). The report of data summaries and listings will include information on both safety and efficacy parameters, together with status reports designed to show the extent to which the trial is being executed according to protocol. Included among the safety data will be (a) all deaths and (b) adverse events. Efficacy summaries will provide information on the occurrence of study outcomes. The outcome events are considered as distinct from adverse events and summarized separately. At each review by the DSMB, consideration of a decision to stop the trial on grounds of patient safety will weigh the current evidence of differences between treatments regarding adverse effects (as expressed by mortality, adverse event reports, etc.) against emerging trends in efficacy. Providing efficacy data at each of these routine safety reviews does not constitute a formal interim analysis of efficacy. Blinded data for the safety review will be made available from the Central Study Database. Serious adverse events are required to be reported rapidly to the FCVRI Project Office and will be entered into a separate data base. These reports will be added to the data to be reviewed by the DSMB. Outcome events will be reviewed by the Event Adjudication Committee on an ongoing basis to determine if each reported event meets the defined criteria for a study outcome event. The DSMB will review data on all reported outcome events. Additional summaries will show the results of the Event Adjudication Committee's judgements on the subset of reports that has been reviewed by this committee. This committee is independent from the FCVRI and its responsibilities are to review the protocol and perform an interim analysis plan, review safety, efficacy, compliance and trial progress at 12 months after the first randomization and if requested by the Steering Committee. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will make recommendations to the Steering Committee about any potential problems. Any major recommendation, e.g. amending the protocol or stopping the trial will be reviewed and ratified by the Steering Committee.</offsets></p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="40103" xml_f="40144" txt_i="33373" txt_f="33414">Adverse Events and Adjudication Committee</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40155" xml_f="41460" txt_i="33415" txt_f="34720">The Event Adjudication Committee is charged with the responsibility for validating all reported primary fatal and nonfatal outcomes and validating the classification of cause of death.
