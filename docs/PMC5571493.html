These findings suggest that quinine is a molecule with a hypoglycemic potential and its effects should be therefore monitored mostly during the 1st hour of the infusion. In addition, intravenous administration of quinine in a patient at risk of developing hypoglycemia must be done with caution since its hypoglycemic tendency can unmask or precipitate hypoglycemia in such patients.
