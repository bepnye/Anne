As participants requested to be actively involved in the allocation process, they were invited to choose an envelope from a pre-prepared box of ten envelopes. After each allocation, this box was then refilled with envelopes from another box containing five envelopes for the intervention group and five for the control group. Although the envelopes were equally distributed in the second box, this was not necessarily the case with the participant box.

The authors argue that at the time of the trial, antiretrovirals were unavailable in the public health sector in South Africa, and that the participants received intensive counselling on how to avoid contracting and transmitting HIV. The researchers chose not to inform those who were HIV-positive at the beginning because they were concerned that exclusion from the trial would be stigmatising. Men were encouraged to attend voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) in a nearby public clinic or in a special VCT centre in the same building as the investigation centre. Men who tested positive for other sexually transmitted infections that were treatable locally were referred to the local clinic.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9634" xml_f="10546" txt_i="4913" txt_f="5825">Avoiding stigmatisation is an important consideration, but it could be argued that if withholding HIV status was the only feasible option, then the conditions were not suitable to conduct such a trial. In fact, referring participants to the local VCT centre or the clinic for treatment of other sexually transmitted infections may have resulted in more stigmatisation, as this referral would have been visible to others rather than only to those within the trial processes. Some might argue that the nondisclosure of HIV status fails the test of beneficence (the obligation to prevent and remove harms and to promote the good of a person by minimising the risks incurred to the research participant and maximising the benefits to them and others). Not only were participants affected by nondisclosure, but so were their partners. It is unlikely that this approach would be tolerated in a more developed setting [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0020393-b12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10591" xml_f="10593" txt_i="5825" txt_f="5827">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10600" xml_f="10602" txt_i="5827" txt_f="5829">].</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s6"><title><offsets xml_i="10632" xml_f="10651" txt_i="5831" txt_f="5850">Policy Implications</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10662" xml_f="11488" txt_i="5851" txt_f="6677">The trialists suggest that circumcision could be rapidly incorporated into national plans of countries where circumcision is not widely practised, while recognising that promotion of circumcision may also lead to undesirable outcomes such as undermining condom promotion. They are right to argue that we need to seriously consider circumcision as a potential prevention method, but it seems wise to be more cautious in making recommendations for policy. Within- and between-country differences in culture, religion, and social norms will need to be very carefully considered before implementing circumcision programmes. Crucially, the results of two additional trials underway in Uganda and Kenya are awaited. Considering the results of all three trials together is likely to provide us with stronger evidence to guide policy.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>I am deeply grateful to Michael Parker and Iain Chalmers for their advice and comments on the draft paper.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="n3" fn-type="other"><p>
