A randomised equivalence trial was undertaken to assess whether well trained lay people could offer review and self-management support to adults with asthma with results which would be equivalent to nurse led care.

In total 567 patients were randomised to either a lay educator or a practice based nurse within each participating general practice. Eligible patients were adults aged 18 or over with clinician diagnosed asthma with persistent disease requiring regular preventative therapy. Participants also had evidence of unscheduled health care usage or increased medication for the treatment of an exacerbation in the 12 months prior to recruitment. The intervention was a disease specific asthma self management programme delivered by the practice nurse or lay educator. A total of 19 lay educators were recruited, who had personal or family experience of asthma. 15 of these were trained however only 8 actively participated in the trial. Lay educators were involved in the trial on a part-time basis and were not contractually employed. Both the lay educators and the practice nurses received specialised training prior to the trial.

Follow up telephone consultations were carried out by either the practice nurse or lay educator depending on the allocated intervention arm and were undertaken every three months for one year. Topics addressed during consultations were recommended in national and international guidelines and included aetiology of asthma and long term nature of the disease, asthma medications and uses, triggers and allergen avoidance and recognition of worsening symptoms and actions to take.

The cost for the telephone consultations did not include line rental, only the costs per minute for staff to deliver the consultations. The baseline analysis also accounted for the opportunity costs of consultants for those lay trainers who did not claim for their costs. Reimbursement to lay educators for the delivery of consultations was not consistent in the trial as many did not claim for the time they spent carrying out the consultations. The protocol had specified that lay educators would be paid for their time, however, the actual costs incurred were lower than expected due to the lack of claims.

The total cost of the intervention if the practice nurses and lay educators had fulfilled the protocol and given all patients two consultations and 4 telephone consultations (Scenario 1) would have increased the costs to £241 for practice nurses and £186 for lay educators but still with no significant differences between the study arms (£54). There were some difficulties adhering to the protocol within the trial, where both nurses and lay-trainers did not always manage to give each patient two face to face consultations and four telephone consultations. Lay trainers were part-time and nurses still had a full clinical load, which impacted on time available to see the study patients. Scenario 2 builds on the first scenario but only 50% of the consultation costs for lay educators are used to examine the impact of the large majority of lay advisers who did not claim back for their time. When the cost of building in extra time for the telephone consultations was added the cost rose to £260 for practice nurses and £191 for lay educators (Scenario 3).</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T5"><label><offsets xml_i="39401" xml_f="39408" txt_i="24016" txt_f="24023">Table 5</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="39428" xml_f="39516" txt_i="24023" txt_f="24111">Scenario analysis - Total cost (training, intervention and unscheduled healthcare usage)</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center"></col><col align="center"></col><col align="center"></col><col align="center"></col></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="39762" xml_f="39763" txt_i="24112" txt_f="24113"> </offsets><hr></hr></th><th align="center" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="39818" xml_f="39842" txt_i="24113" txt_f="24137">Practice nurse (n = 205)</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="center" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="39904" xml_f="39926" txt_i="24137" txt_f="24159">Lay educator (n = 213)</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="center" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="39988" xml_f="39995" txt_i="24159" txt_f="24166">P-value</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th></tr><tr><th align="center"><offsets xml_i="40044" xml_f="40045" txt_i="24166" txt_f="24167"> </offsets></th><th align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="40075" xml_f="40084" txt_i="24167" txt_f="24176">Mean (SD)</offsets></bold></th><th align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="40121" xml_f="40130" txt_i="24176" txt_f="24185">Mean (SD)</offsets></bold></th><th align="center"><offsets xml_i="40161" xml_f="40162" txt_i="24185" txt_f="24186"> </offsets></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="40237" xml_f="40254" txt_i="24186" txt_f="24203">Baseline analysis</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="40303" xml_f="40314" txt_i="24204" txt_f="24215">£202 (£717)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="40363" xml_f="40374" txt_i="24216" txt_f="24227">£178 (£554)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="40423" xml_f="40432" txt_i="24228" txt_f="24237">p = 0.707</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><italic><offsets xml_i="40502" xml_f="40512" txt_i="24238" txt_f="24248">Scenario 1</offsets></italic></bold><italic><offsets xml_i="40536" xml_f="40537" txt_i="24248" txt_f="24249">:</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="40546" xml_f="40565" txt_i="24249" txt_f="24268"> Protocol adherence</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="40614" xml_f="40625" txt_i="24269" txt_f="24280">£241 (£718)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="40674" xml_f="40685" txt_i="24281" txt_f="24292">£186 (£554)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="40734" xml_f="40743" txt_i="24293" txt_f="24302">p = 0.385</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><italic><offsets xml_i="40813" xml_f="40824" txt_i="24303" txt_f="24314">Scenario 2:</offsets></italic></bold><offsets xml_i="40840" xml_f="40908" txt_i="24314" txt_f="24382"> Protocol adherence and 50% of consultations costs for lay educators</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="40957" xml_f="40968" txt_i="24383" txt_f="24394">£241 (£718)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="41017" xml_f="41028" txt_i="24395" txt_f="24406">£179 (£554)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="41077" xml_f="41089" txt_i="24407" txt_f="24416">p &lt;

Hidden costs such as the cost of mentoring and supporting the practice nurses and lay educators in practices were not explored, although it was noted that extensive support was given at the beginning of the trial. To extrapolate this study to real life the lay educators would need some form of mentoring within their practices.

Several of the trainers dropped out of the study shortly after training, significantly contributing to the training costs. This was in part due to a delay in the trial start-up. The asthma trainers were not contractually employed and the training course was a “one-off” making it difficult to re-recruit new trainers. Updating of training and training of new staff should be considered if lay educators are rolled out into clinical practice. Prior to the trial, and contrary to expectations, very few of the practice nurses had had any additional asthma training (only one of the forty-six nurses had an Asthma diploma). This low rate of acquisition of training to permit nurses to competently undertake additional tasks such as asthma reviews may or may not be representative of other parts of the UK [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"><offsets xml_i="45634" xml_f="45636" txt_i="28409" txt_f="28411">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45643" xml_f="46609" txt_i="28411" txt_f="29377">]. Due to competing pressures for time many practice nurses found it difficult to conform to the trial protocol, as is seen with the lower completed consultation rates compared with the lay educators. The lay educators for example, were more successful than nurses in contacting patients and persuading them to attend for review and undertook more telephone follow ups. In reality it is likely that the nurses did not adhere to the recommended time durations for consultations which would have reduced their costs as we have considered in our scenario analysis, although it is likely that lay educators might also “speed up” with time. Certainly unit costs for the lay educators could be expected to be reduced in real life, since within the trial, the lay educators often travelled to a practice to see only one or two patients randomised to them, whereas a lay educator working full time and in one location and preferably across practices could be more effective.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46616" xml_f="46999" txt_i="29378" txt_f="29761">These scenarios were devised assuming that changes in intervention delivery would not impact on unscheduled health care utilisation.

The difficulties with recruitment in Manchester, accompanied by problems with Ethics Committee approvals and delays in utilising lay educators newly acquired skills, led to a situation where there was drop out of educators, practices and nurses and full equivalence of intervention was intimated if not quite proven. However few seeing these results can doubt that in one prescribed area of competency, well trained lay educators have been shown to be capable of delivering healthcare in a manner comparable to traditional care, which in the UK is by primary care based Practice Nurses.

Lay educators would have to appropriately recruited and trained to ensure training costs are not wasted.

As the outcomes appeared to be similar to those of nurses further work is needed to see how we can use them more effectively to ensure their higher training costs are used to maximise delivery of lower cost care. Further consideration and exploration of the potential role of lay educators within the NHS is needed.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="51416" xml_f="51435" txt_i="33962" txt_f="33981">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="51446" xml_f="51504" txt_i="33982" txt_f="34040">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="51526" xml_f="51548" txt_i="34042" txt_f="34064">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="51559" xml_f="51737" txt_i="34065" txt_f="34243">All authors contributed to the design and development of the costing study.
