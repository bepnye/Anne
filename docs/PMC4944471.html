A recent systematic review assessing the impact of volunteers involved in the direct care of palliative care patients and their families at the end-of-life only found 8 studies, none from the UK. They indicate that volunteer involvement has a positive impact on satisfaction with care and that people may survive longer with home visits from a volunteer. They conclude that further research is needed to ensure the resource of volunteers in palliative care is used appropriately and effectively.

The purpose of this evaluation is to use a robust and ethical comparative design to determine the effect of volunteer led social action befriending services on quality of life in the last year of life and how such services can best be implemented and delivered. Research of this sort can ensure that the resource of volunteers in palliative care is used appropriately, and in a way which effectively improves quality of life and the experience in the last year of life. Many volunteer delivered befriending social action services are being run or developed to provide non-clinical support to people in their own homes such as companionship, running errands and providing information. Whilst this feels intuitively helpful, there is no robust evaluation of the outcomes of these services nor understanding of how best to provide such care to maximise effectiveness.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title><offsets xml_i="10252" xml_f="10266" txt_i="4634" txt_f="4648">Methods/design</offsets></title><sec id="Sec3"><title><offsets xml_i="10296" xml_f="10300" txt_i="4649" txt_f="4653">Aims</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10311" xml_f="10315" txt_i="4654" txt_f="4658">The </offsets><bold><offsets xml_i="10321" xml_f="10332" txt_i="4658" txt_f="4669">primary aim</offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="10339" xml_f="10571" txt_i="4669" txt_f="4901"> of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of receiving care from a social action volunteer befriending service plus standard care at improving quality of life as compared to usual care alone for adults in the last year of life.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10578" xml_f="10582" txt_i="4902" txt_f="4906">The </offsets><bold><offsets xml_i="10588" xml_f="10602" txt_i="4906" txt_f="4920">secondary aims</offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="10609" xml_f="10617" txt_i="4920" txt_f="4928"> are to:</offsets><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="10656" xml_f="10794" txt_i="4928" txt_f="5066">explore whether the social action volunteer befriending service reduces loneliness and affects the perception of social support for adults</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="10824" xml_f="10960" txt_i="5067" txt_f="5203">examine whether informal carers for those receiving care from a social action volunteer befriending service experience less carer burden</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="10990" xml_f="11143" txt_i="5204" txt_f="5357">determine whether receiving care from a social action volunteer befriending service can affect participant’s use of other health and social care services</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="11173" xml_f="11305" txt_i="5358" txt_f="5490">identify and explore the factors that influence the impact of social action volunteer befriending services on end-of-life experience</offsets></p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title><offsets xml_i="11360" xml_f="11376" txt_i="5493" txt_f="5509">The intervention</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11387" xml_f="12689" txt_i="5510" txt_f="6812">The intervention is based on a model of social action, and comprises a number of components. Core to the intervention is that it is provided by a trained volunteer rather than a paid member of staff, and provides non-clinical, non-hands on support. Individual support needs are assessed by the non-clinical volunteer co-ordinator, and support then provided from a suite of possible options including ‘befriending’ e.g. sitting with someone to provide companionship, ‘practical support’ e.g. assisting with household tasks such as dog walking, gardening, picking up prescriptions or other errands, and ‘signposting’ e.g. providing information on other available services. Support will be typically provided from 1–3 times per week, face to face or by telephone, as negotiated between volunteer providers and participants. Participants will be in the trial for 8 or 12 weeks (immediate vs wait-list arm), but their receipt of the social action volunteer service can continue outside the trial beyond this point if needed. Participants are free to withdraw at any time. Participants will continue to receive all usual care during this period.

In the UK people are used to short waits for services and are unlikely to feel seriously disadvantaged by a short wait.</offsets></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="37352" xml_f="37557" txt_i="28299" txt_f="28504">Third, these social action services are not currently available to participants, and they would not be receiving the potential benefit of these services without the funding available to support this trial.</offsets></p></list-item></list></p><p><offsets xml_i="37587" xml_f="38405" txt_i="28506" txt_f="29324">There is a further risk that these services cause burden, distress or harm rather than the intended benefit. This is unlikely to be the case, as other similar services have had reports of satisfaction, and the service provided is not core clinical work or hands on care but additional social support. The qualitative interview data collected from participants should give an indication of experience which can be used to monitor this possibility. Participants will also have written information given to them, and verbally explained, about the complaints and other procedures to follow if they have any concerns or feedback related to either their service provision or the conduct of the research. The research team and service provider sites will work closely together to monitor any issues and act upon them rapidly.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38412" xml_f="38866" txt_i="29325" txt_f="29779">There is also a risk that patient and carer participants may be concerned or distressed by some of the questions asked within the questionnaire toolkit. This risk will be minimised by using existing well validated standardised tools, which have been tested in a number of similar populations, and in different cultures and contexts. The tools have been carefully chosen to be short and easy to complete to minimise participant burden as much as possible.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38873" xml_f="39300" txt_i="29780" txt_f="30207">Finally, the risk that participants will be contacted to complete subsequent questionnaires or to be invited to interview when they may be too unwell through deterioration in their condition, or that carers may be distressed by such information after a participants’ death will be mitigated by a clear protocol between the sites and the University to ensure that this information is securely transferred to avoid such distress.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title><offsets xml_i="39333" xml_f="39351" txt_i="30209" txt_f="30227">Potential benefits</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39362" xml_f="40221" txt_i="30228" txt_f="31087">Whilst no direct benefit to participants has been promised, they may enjoy and benefit from the social action intervention. This intervention can continue after the research phase of the service: services have been asked to provide this service as per their assessment of need, the only difference to usual service provision is the wait period for those allocated to the wait-list condition. Indirectly, our experience of conducting research in palliative care has shown that patients and informal carers have been willing to take part in such studies as a method of reciprocity for the care they have received from palliative care practitioners and in the knowledge that their participation will inform the overall understanding of the provision of care and benefit others in the future; this finding is increasingly being supported by a growing literature [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27"><offsets xml_i="40254" xml_f="40256" txt_i="31087" txt_f="31089">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40263" xml_f="40264" txt_i="31089" txt_f="31090">–</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29"><offsets xml_i="40297" xml_f="40299" txt_i="31090" txt_f="31092">29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40306" xml_f="40461" txt_i="31092" txt_f="31247">].
