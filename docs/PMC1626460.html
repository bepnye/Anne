We initially assumed that patients who didn't discuss CHD prevention with their doctor did not have a specific plan for risk reduction, but tested this assumption in subsequent analyses.

The list included both behavioral (e.g. diet low in saturated fat, regular exercise, weight loss if overweight, smoking cessation if smoking) and medication interventions (e.g. hypertension medication, cholesterol medication, and aspirin). It also included interventions that do not reduce the chances of heart disease (e.g. estrogen, vitamin e, calcium, and monitoring morning body temperature) as distracters. As a conservative measure of overall knowledge, we calculated the proportion of patients who accurately identified all four interventions supported by the best evidence (e.g. hypertension medication, cholesterol medication, aspirin, and smoking cessation). Finally, we used a series of single questions to query patients about their perception that barriers commonly identified in the literature would prevent them from initiating CHD prevention (e.g. lack of knowledge, difficulty determining how important it is to lower CHD risk, difficulty determine the best way to lower CHD risk, concerns about other health problems, lack of symptoms, and difficulty communicating their needs to their doctor).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21916" xml_f="21936" txt_i="17295" txt_f="17315">Statistical analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21947" xml_f="22899" txt_i="17316" txt_f="18268">To assess the success of randomization, we compared the baseline characteristics of subjects who received the decision aid with those who were in the control group.

We subsequently calculated the within group effects of the decision aid on 1) patients' perceptions that addressing CHD is important, 2) their perceptions that CHD prevention requires a decision, 3) their desires to participate in decision making, and 4) their stated plans for risk reduction.

First, successful implementation of some of the options to lower CHD risk (e.g. hypertension medication, cholesterol medication) require doctor input. Users of our decision aid must therefore be able to successfully communicate their informed decision to their doctor and gain support for their chosen intervention. This was not true in the aforementioned study by Lovibond, in which all risk reduction strategies could be accomplished outside the clinical encounter. Whether our decision aid encourages users to successfully communicate their decisions to their doctor and gain the necessary support for intervention is a matter we didn't directly examine. We can not ignore the seeming paradox, however, that although decision aid users reported more discussions with their doctor and more plans for CHD risk reduction, they did not report a greater desire for shared decision making after using the decision aid.

First, future studies should use a larger sample size: this would provide greater power to detect the effect of the decision aid, would improve the random distribution of baseline characteristics, and would also allow for adjustment of relevant confounders. In the current study, we were unable to adjust for important differences between the intervention and control groups (e.g. CHD risk, number of options for risk reduction, desire for independent decision making, and reported ease in communicating with their doctor), which may have biased the results toward a greater effect of the decision aid than was actually present. Second, future studies should consider random sampling and more dedicated study time to avoid attrition after randomization: these would help minimize selection bias. Although selection bias didn't appear to be a major problem in our study, we approached a convenience sample of patients and cannot exclude differences among our study sample and all of those eligible for inclusion. We also can't adequately estimate the effects of the small differences in the number of patients who left the intervention and control groups after randomization. Finally, future studies should consider both remote and practice-level randomization: this would reduce the possible contamination of results that could occur with local randomization techniques and doctors in the study who see both the decision aid and the control patients.
