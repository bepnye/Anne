Secondly, we wanted health personnel to better know TB patients and their realities through performing patient centered home visits and case discussion centered on the problems experienced by TB patients. The objective of the patient centered home visit was to know better the social network of the patient, identify strength and weaknesses of the network, and plan activities to support the patient. Health professionals were expected to listen to the relatives and neighbours of the patients, identify their feelings towards the patient (their fear, disgust, support, etc), and plan with the social network activities to support the patient during his treatment. A specific guide was conceived to assist health care providers.

In July 2004, a follow-up visit was done by researchers and several problems were encountered. A newly appointed medical doctor was performing the first consultation for TB patients.

It was however decided to organize TB cases discussion and to focus on the reorganization of the TB patient's pathway. During 2004 and 2005, only one case discussion was organized during a monitoring visit. It was very much centered on TB control and not much on the difficulties met by TB patients. The revision of the patient's pathway was not really done because of changes in health staff.

The regional level proposed a special format for home visits providing information on the TB patients' psychosocial conditions in addition to the usual contact tracing data. In January 2005, the TB clubs were chaired by TB patients themselves. They also decided to appoint an executive board. In Siuna, home visits were done mainly close by the health center. Quickly after, TB clubs started first in the health center upon the initiative of the nurse in charge of TB patients and the doctor responsible of epidemiology. Later on, a TB club executive board constituted of TB patients was set up. In other areas, two cured TB patients took the initiative of starting a club with 5–6 patients.

However, after 2 months, difference between scores was statistically significant, revealing a decreased internalized stigma in the intervention group and not in the control group (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T5"><offsets xml_i="36918" xml_f="36919" txt_i="26247" txt_f="26248">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36926" xml_f="36928" txt_i="26248" txt_f="26250">).</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T5"><label><offsets xml_i="36976" xml_f="36983" txt_i="26251" txt_f="26258">Table 5</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="37003" xml_f="37093" txt_i="26258" txt_f="26348">Scale mean score after 15 days and 2 months of treatment in control and intervention group</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="37172" xml_f="37188" txt_i="26349" txt_f="26365">Scale mean value</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37212" xml_f="37219" txt_i="26366" txt_f="26373">Control</offsets><break></break><offsets xml_i="37234" xml_f="37241" txt_i="26373" txt_f="26380">n = 146</offsets><break></break><offsets xml_i="37256" xml_f="37273" txt_i="26380" txt_f="26397">19 missing values</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37297" xml_f="37309" txt_i="26398" txt_f="26410">Intervention</offsets><break></break><offsets xml_i="37324" xml_f="37331" txt_i="26410" txt_f="26417">n = 122</offsets><break></break><offsets xml_i="37346" xml_f="37363" txt_i="26417" txt_f="26434">14 missing values</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37387" xml_f="37396" txt_i="26435" txt_f="26444">Stat sign</offsets></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="37442" xml_f="37455" txt_i="26445" txt_f="26458">After 15 days</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37479" xml_f="37483" txt_i="26459" txt_f="26463">34,6</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37507" xml_f="37511" txt_i="26464" txt_f="26468">31,7</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37535" xml_f="37543" txt_i="26469" txt_f="26477">p = 0,08</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="37574" xml_f="37588" txt_i="26478" txt_f="26492">After 2 months</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37612" xml_f="37616" txt_i="26493" txt_f="26497">33,1</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37640" xml_f="37644" txt_i="26498" txt_f="26502">27,4</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37668" xml_f="37677" txt_i="26503" txt_f="26512">p = 0,001</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="37708" xml_f="37747" txt_i="26513" txt_f="26552">Difference between 2 months and 15 days</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37771" xml_f="37774" txt_i="26553" txt_f="26556">1,5</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37798" xml_f="37801" txt_i="26557" txt_f="26560">4,3</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="37825" xml_f="37833" txt_i="26561" txt_f="26569">p = 0,03</offsets></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37896" xml_f="37906" txt_i="26572" txt_f="26582">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37917" xml_f="38144" txt_i="26583" txt_f="26810">Most of the published studies identified the ignorance about tuberculosis, false communities' beliefs and fears as the reasons for tuberculosis social stigma.

Reducing only the internalized stigma within a context of good case holding management is important. The need to look at the TB patient's wellbeing, in addition to the TB epidemics control, has indeed been acknowledged in recent international reflections and policies on TB control [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"><offsets xml_i="39729" xml_f="39731" txt_i="28116" txt_f="28118">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39738" xml_f="39739" txt_i="28118" txt_f="28119">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"><offsets xml_i="39771" xml_f="39773" txt_i="28119" txt_f="28121">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39780" xml_f="39782" txt_i="28121" txt_f="28123">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39789" xml_f="41144" txt_i="28124" txt_f="29479">We should consider this study as an initial step and conclusion concerning outcome measure would need to be confirmed in bigger scale study. Indeed, outcome of this type of intervention should have been probably better analyzed by grouping TB patients by municipios. This would give stronger evidences on the relationship between a given context, stakeholders, intervention package and the outcome. However, given the small scale and the low detection rate of TB patients in the municipios of study, we had to analyze all municipios together. Additionally, this study has been performed in a specific context, i.e. municipios chosen by the national TB coordinator among the least performing in remote area. Conclusion of this study, and mainly external validity, would probably be stronger if similar process would be performed in multiple contexts. Finally, risk of information bias (i.e. patients being aware of the importance of a change between their initial and their second response in the filling of the stigma scale), was prevented in two ways. Firstly, patients were not aware of being part of the intervention or the control group. Secondly, the internalized stigma scale was "self applied" by TB patients with eventually the assistance of a patient's relative, outside of the health care facility and the influence of health care professionals.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41151" xml_f="41485" txt_i="29480" txt_f="29814">These results should not be analyzed mechanically, by trying to link a standardized package of intervention to a given outcome.

It would be indeed naïve to believe that any type of TB clubs and home visit independently from the context and the stakeholders would improve internalized stigma in TB patients. Indeed in our study, the implementation of the patient centered package has been highly dependent on the context and more specifically on the stakeholders at the local level. Two central stakeholders were critical for a successful intervention package: the TB patients and the nurse in charge of the TB patients. In the first group of municipalities (Siuna and Bluefield), the TB patients played an active role in the TB club activities and other support activities for TB patients, thanks to some individualities' leadership. In the same municipalities, and also in La Dalia, nurses caring for TB patients where highly motivated, knew the community members very well, and were used to working with TB patients, as they have a long lasting experience in such position. In those cases, nurses were supported by authorities: the nurse of Siuna benefited from a dynamic municipal health management team stable during the time of the research; the nurse of Bluefield benefited from the proximity of an enthusiastic TB program responsible at the regional level. Finally, in both Bluefield and Siuna, the work of the nurse responsible of the TB patients, was supported by local NGO's.
