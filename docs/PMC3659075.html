mortality from acute myocardial infarction, heart failure remains a common complication, and may develop very early or long after the acute event. Reperfusion itself leads to further tissue damage, a process described as ischaemia-reperfusion-injury (IRI), which contributes up to 50% of the final infarct size. In experimental models nitrite administration potently protects against IRI in several organs, including the heart. In the current study we investigate whether intravenous sodium nitrite administration immediately prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction will reduce myocardial infarct size.

Secondary end points include (i) plasma creatine kinase and Troponin I measured in blood samples taken pre-injection of the study medication and over the following 72 hours; (ii) infarct size at six months; (iii) Infarct size corrected for AAR measured at 6–8 days using T2 weighted triple inversion recovery (T2-W SPAIR or STIR) CMR imaging; (iv) Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction measured by CMR at 6–8 days and six months following injection of the study medication; and (v) LV end systolic volume index at 6–8 days and six months.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9291" xml_f="9331" txt_i="1984" txt_f="2024">Funding, ethics and regulatory approvals</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9342" xml_f="9634" txt_i="2025" txt_f="2317">This study is funded by a grant from the UK Medical Research Council.

The estimate of treatment effect in the Aarhus study was a reduction of IS from 15% in the control to approximately 9% in the intervention group, a reduction of 6%.

The simulated data sets were analysed using ANCOVA to reflect the primary trial analysis. The proportion of simulated trials that return p-values less than 0.05 was then counted to evaluate the power of ANCOVA. A sample size of 150 (75 per group) will provide 90% power to detect a difference of 4% between treatment and control group in IS corrected for AAR. The sample size has been expanded by approximately 30-35% to account for loss of outcome measure due to death, those who decline CMR or are unsuitable for CMR due to renal dysfunction and those in whom the CMR scans are technically inadequate.

Whilst soundly based on animal studies, this proposal would be the first in man study to investigate whether intravenous infusion of sodium nitrite reduces myocardial infarct size.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38811" xml_f="38830" txt_i="27914" txt_f="27933">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38841" xml_f="38900" txt_i="27934" txt_f="27993">The authors declared that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38922" xml_f="38944" txt_i="27995" txt_f="28017">Authors’ contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38955" xml_f="39925" txt_i="28018" txt_f="28988">All authors listed above fulfil all International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines for authorship.
